In 2015 alone, 653 American athletes applied for ""exemptions"" from doping, with a variety of reasons, including the so-called asthma, which was the easiest to apply for.
The World Anti-Doping Agency also cooperated as much as possible, and as a result, 402 athletes obtained ""exemptions"", with a pass rate of 60%.
In sharp contrast, the number of Chinese athletes who obtained ""exemptions"" was less than 10.
For example, American gymnast Simone Biles won four gold medals at the Rio Olympics.
She tested positive in the urine test after the game, but she was not banned.

Not like purple face american or australian swimmers, with therapeutic use exemptions , Asthma, or ADHD, ''legal'' cheating with ITPP.
Which country has the most therapeutic use exemptions ? the most cases of Asthma and ADHD ? 
USA team : yes 
What is ITPP? 
USA team and USADA : Yes 
myo-Inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP) is an inositol phosphate, a pyrophosphate, a putative performance-enhancing substance, which exerts its biological effects by increasing tissue oxygenation. ITPP increases oxygen release from red blood cells and the supply of oxygen supply reduced the consequences of hypoxia in target tissues. 
Side effect : bluish purple face/ face Cyanosis",@lukeecle117,,4,2024-08-16 18:42:07

UgzYc9FEsDGo-JZGXzx4AaABAg,q14W1uCJag4,"the underwater shot then overhead shot at 0:31 really show that his technique is just superior. unlike most of the field he really does glide, like his arm on his breathing side actually really pauses in full extension for a split second during which his powerful kick fuels the glide. Then in the overhead shot you see that unlike the others once again, he stays very very high in the water, compare it to Popivici in lane 2 or the american in lane 1, you can see that they submerge themselves then rise above the water then submerge again etc. that's a lot of up and down movement that makes them inevitably slower than Pan I guess.

Which allows for them to legally use bronchodilators which is a stimulant and gives significant advantage in how much air you can breathe in and out. Think trying to breath through a thin straw vs a fat one. 4) The supposed scandal from 2021 where some Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned heart medicine was cleared by two separate independent investigation.

Also, Simone’s difficulty level is much higher on floor and vault than the other gymnasts. They are fighting to stick every landing and not give away any points while Simone has a cushion. Stuck landings are great but Simone deserves her flowers for pushing herself and attempting the harder skills while others play it safe.",@jevonk,,3,2024-08-23 20:59:11

But Simone actually does land a lot of her passes very well, eg  in team finals at world championships 2023. It’s especially difficult for her too, because she does the most difficult tumbling, generates a lot of power, and flies very high- the higher you fall from, and the more power you generate, the more difficult to control the landing.",@kattehkittyable,,0,2024-12-10 11:54:20

Real inclusivity means honoring diverse values, including faith, family, tradition, and modesty, not pushing them aside. I’m not here to attack anyone’s lifestyle, but I do think it’s worth asking: are we actually embracing diversity, or are we replacing one worldview with another?

Votre commentaire est très intéressant. Il ne dénigre pas la culture française mais exprime votre point de vue. Merci pour cela. 
Il m'a semblé, pour ma part, que cette cérémonie était fédératrice. Sans sombrer dans le ""woke"" ou ""anti-woke"", je l'ai trouvée drôle et émouvante, traditionnelle et moderne, convenable et scandaleuse, conservatrice et progressiste, kitch et sophistiquée. J'ai vraiment trouvé que chacun pouvait s'identifier à un moment où à un autre, et qu'à travers la culture française et universaliste, on pouvait se rassembler :)
Cela étant, la cérémonie reste l'introduction des jeux olympiques par le pays organisateur. Je suis français, et l'organisation des épreuves a été merveilleuse. Paris est magique. 
Hâte de voir Los Angeles 2028. Je suis sûr que cela sera superbe aussi.

Cette cérémonie est remplie de défauts, de ratés, de longueurs comme seuls les Français sont capable . Et  en plus le temps était épouvantable.
Pourtant je ne m'en lasse pas. 

Je suis bien Français !  toujours à critiquer.
J'aurais voulu que tout soit parfait.
Je ne voie que ce qui n'a pas fonctionné
Pourtant je continu à la regarder. 6 mois après.

Ah oui !!! je suis masochiste. Autre travers Français !
Ce n'est pas à la hauteur de la France, de son histoire.
Que vont penser les étrangers de ce spectacle moyen moyen.
Pourtant.... j'e m'en fout.... je suis hypnotisé comme un lapin par les phares d'une voiture.

Et si en fait il fallait l'admettre ??!!
C'était vibrant !!!
C'était grandiose !!!!
C'était poétique !!!!

C'était très Français. 
Des imperfections magnifiées !
Des sons de grand mère affreusement délicieux !
Des images ringardes ridiculement orgasmiques.

UgxKLZKv94wUdEgtpZJ4AaABAg,onP5-DKSbI4,"After watching the entire opening and closing ceremonies, I realized that the French have completely dominated house music. Almost all the classic house tracks have come from them. And I didn’t even know that many of them were French until I watched these Olympic ceremonies. For example, it never even crossed my mind before that Kavinsky was French. And there are so many more like that.

But… there’s something incredibly, overwhelmingly sad about this. The two greatest musicians in the world weren’t there because they split up. And when you think of house music, these guys are like the gods of house music. They’re also French. Meaning, they are exactly the people who should have been there. But since they broke up, they weren’t playing. These guys were made for this show. Or rather, this show was practically made for them. And yet… not seeing them really hurt.

Even if they weren’t there performing themselves, I would have understood. But not a single track of theirs was played. Not even one. That’s what’s truly heartbreaking. Every time house music played during the ceremonies, my eyes searched for them. The guys I’m talking about have always worn masks. And if you noticed, all the dancers, the person carrying the torch—everyone was masked. It’s like this whole thing was made for them to be there. Yet not a single one of their songs was played. I’m suffering.",@RanaSirel,,6,2025-03-08 06:53:45

The opinions here are very far removed from the actuality of disorganization as evidenced by the numerous complains of those who watched the ceremonies live in person and on tv. An opinion is a statement that can be publicly voiced to appear as truth but privately told to the self as a lie. Learn that next.,@xzyeee,,2,2025-02-04 10:22:30
UgwNyOKN3TSnA9wFqx54AaABAg,UgwNyOKN3TSnA9wFqx54AaABAg,"As a Paris 2024 spectator, I found the ceremony to be memorable and groundbreaking, but here you are trying to reframe the narrative that my direct experience is misaligned with the so-called 'truth'. Whatever you are trying to say, It doesn't exist. When it comes to matters of artistic human endeveours like cinema, art, music, dance and performance, perspectives are diverse and one can not claim an absolute truth. In addition to that your argument is flawed by fact, An IOC poll across 15000 spectators found a statistically significant 86% of French Attendees and 80% of International Attendees enjoyed the show.",@tedmink7568,,2,2025-02-04 12:09:04

You just have an opinion regarding the games and are trying your best to invalidate and deny other people's opinions and credible statistical evidence so that allign with your narrative. Paris 2024 ended almost 6 months ago, and the public has voiced their opinion through surveys through direct experiences and through the internet. Nothing you say will invalidate the widespread positivity and exhibiliration behind the games and ceremonies.

人们并非对这些个人缺乏同情，也不是在亵渎宗教或神灵（尽管围绕开幕式涉嫌亵渎基督教的指控确实引发了公众的愤怒）。公众仅仅是认为巴黎此次的活动组织极其糟糕，甚至可以说是灾难性的失败。整届奥运会，从开幕式到比赛本身，都更像是一场闹剧。塞纳河因污染问题成为比赛场地，成为奥运史上争议最激烈的场地之一。

总而言之，关于2024年奥运会有太多值得批评的地方。而你所提到的内容远不足以掩盖或弥补法国的失败。你们与西方不过是在竭尽全力相互维护罢了。真是名副其实的“老欧洲大陆”！",@xiaokanfengyun-xn,,1,2025-01-18 03:05:39

It is not an unpopular opinion, too. Paris recorded the highest ratings, sponsorships and spectatorship of all games and was amplified through all forms of media.

I don't have a conservative attitude. I embrace innovation and that was what Paris did from the non-stadium opening, champions park, entertainment during the games, free and affordable tickets and public marathon, Paris has celebrated sportsmanship and unity more than any other games.

The Opening Ceremony alone was enough  for me to fall in love with the games. The bells of the Notre Dame, the celebration of French literature, women and philosophy, the lasers on the Eiffel Tower and the return of Celine Dion to the global stage were phenemenal. It is no doubt Paris 2024 was the most musically rich and diverse of all games...Victor Le Masne's Parade was the best of all soundtracks.

There's not only real world wars but also a hidden spiritual war between Good and Evil going on atm.
And just because you cannot physically see or hear it, it doesn't mean that it isn't there.
The Devil Lucifer has a strong grip on humanity atm and is manipulating and deceiving people all over the world
in any way possible by convincing them to do his Evil bidding.

But in the end when Judgement Day comes the Devil Lucifer will lose and everyone will get to go to the place they deserve either Heaven or Hell. Based on how true they believe in Jesus and how true they repent for their own sins or not.

      Otherwise, France, thank you for such an accurate trolling on politically active Christians in America that shouldn't have such political power by bribing political crooks over the People's votes-and why the political paradox exists where the People's votes do count but only to allow them to serve the masters that purchased those that do the treason of putting our rights and freedoms up for sale to them like that, they deserve it and I'm glad you gave that to them. Indeed, if it were me, I would do the extremely wild thing of giving each and every citizen in the entire global community, including assholes I don't like, which means yes Christianity you must have nuclear weapons, too, in order for this to work fairly, stockpiles of nuclear weapons to nullify all governments worldwide and to forever insure that nobody gets that type of power in political greed ever again and for everybody to back off of each other and just enjoy the lives they do want to live without dragging others into it by using the might of government to achieve that. In this, if the above ever comes about for real and in America's case that would mean precisely that government ran by church and state legislative partnerships are over as now every citizen in the world has the war winning capabilities to make everything blow up in the faces of tyrants that would be stupid enough to even fuck with nuclear armed citizenry's or even dare attempt to disarm the people of the ultimate go to fuck off weapon to get political power back once the citizenry's have them and deserve it.
        Again, thank you, France, for such a much needed gift to say fuck you to all politically active Christians in America: After all, you might soon need to launch nuclear missiles with every other nuclear capable nation as something stupid such as 2028 President Sarah Palin launches the first nuclear strike of WW3 at Iran because America does become a Christian Nazi nation by then to adopt the policy of achieving political ends by the initiation of nuclear strikes which should always be forbidden.

Olympic is all about sports in general, not about the sexuality or lust, i don't have time with peoples agenda of what gender they might be.

so since i start researching on the truth and before all religions began, you must ask yourself first and formost, Who create robots?, human did create robot, Who create human?, Higher beings create human.

In Revelation 2:13, Pergamum is identified as the place ""where Satan’s throne is,""  referring to the Great Altar of Zeus. This same altar was later moved to Germany, influencing the Nuremberg stadium used by the Nazis—a regime responsible for the deaths of millions decimating 6 million Poles and Jews.

The athletes often competed naked in honor of Zeus and engaged in sexual immorality with temple prostitutes as part of their participation in these pagan rituals. These practices were not just idolatrous but were direct acts of worship to Satan, disguised as the god Zeus.

Given these origins and the explicit connection to Satan, Christians MUST boycott the Olympic Games from now on! Idolatry and immorality that still linger from these ancient practices.

[ Philippians 3:18; Luke 24:44-46-48 KJV Bible ]

🔥 WHOSE END is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things. )

🔥 FOR I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth: to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 
[ Romans 1:15-16; 1 Cor. 1:18-21-31 KJV Bible ]

🔥 FOR THE preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. 
[ 1 Cor. 1:18-21-31; Isaiah 53:1-5-12 KJV Bible ]

🔥 BUT WE preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness:

The painting depicts the wedding of Peleus and Thetis celebrated by the Olympic Gods!  It is, after all, the opening ceremony of the 2024 Olympic games!

Her bronze medal was lost because her floor routine went over the allotted, objective, 1 minute time limit. 
Trying to use race as a reason for her medal being stripped is as authentic as her nails. She thinks because she's not white she doesn't have to follow the same rules as everyone else, and when she breaks those rules all the white people are supposed to just look the other way  since they have now been assured she'll decree them all racist for pointing out a clear rule violation.

Ugy2F6aA6eum_xknUex4AaABAg,nNOjtZYhSJ0,"This is for people calling out Paris and the 'French', and calling this the worst olympics ever

1. Yes it cost a lot to clean it but you have to remember this isn't just cleaning it but installing new comportments and ensuring the Seine will remain clean even after the olympics. It is a huge projet so of course it's going to be expensive whether worth it or not. Also all news of the swimmers being sick afterwards are fake. As of right now no swimmer has become sick and for those saying some people threw up after the race that is completely normal and often occurs after such a ruling race, also bacterial infection don't show up after an hour of contamination. This point is useless and baseless and is just an excuse to bash the olympics
2. Yes, a pretty bad mistake, however seen as everyone in the comments seem to blame France for these controversies, the only defence I will give here is that this is a mistake of the Olympic Committee and has nothing to do with Paris or France. Remember, Paris is just hosting the venues and providing security, the rest such as this is the IOC
3. Again, this is the Olympic committee not Paris
4. I do, for the most part, agree with this point, and this was done by France, however, this did not 'offend' everyone as the Paris opening had a very big approval rate in most countries. Disappointing nonetheless.
5. This is hypocrisy at its finest. The cardboard beds came are the exact same as those from Tokyo, yet when it happened there the athletes and people praised them, for the most part, yet when it happens in Paris it receives rife criticism, I believe this is simply as people like to critique France and praise Japan but I may be wrong. For the AC, I agree Paris should accommodate athletes with it but don't at like there is 'extreme heat', because there isn't and the village is made to be as cool as possible. Also the lack of AC is for the environment. 
6. Nothing to do with Paris or France here and anyways, they got punished for there actions.
7. Again, not Paris or France who chose to do this, just a mistake of a few people. Also this such a minor issue that it being the seventh biggest controversy shows the Paris Olympics isn't as bad as everyone says it is.
8. Wow, it rained, such a controversy. The first few points had some elements behind them but now it's getting ridiculous. 
9. Won't get into politics here, but this was once again a decision from the IOC not Paris.
10. This is a french law. You cannot under any circumstance display your religion in public and the hijab does just that so of course it is banned. Moreover, this has little to do with the olympics, this is purely French politics. Also, it is important to note this is only valid to French athletes not others and so if anything the French committee was actually pretty lenient as it could have asked to ban those aswell.

Let's not forget the great things about these olympics from Paris such as the security (so far), the venues with amazing views, the gender equality (although this was IOS not Paris), the atmosphere, the stadiums, the environmental measures and these are just of the top of my head.

Anyone saying this is the worst olympics ever or something similar has clearly never watched the Olympics as in terms of controversies these are very tame, especially compared to past Olympics. I would even say that, so far, it is probably one of the Olympics with the fewest controversies / controversies caused by Paris.",@noaht1301,,0,2024-08-07 22:09:13

UgzNIuafPKiwdm22Ued4AaABAg,WZRwC4S-vLk,"Beware of Paris syndrome 

Olympic 2024 opening ceremony in Paris was eccentric and extraordinary. French have a reputation for being unpredictable and unapologetic. But even the most francophone of people are now criticizing the scandalous spectacle on the river Seine. 

They showcased a bizarre parody on the last supper. A grotesque reenactment of Marie  Antoinette's beheading. 
Lots of nudity. Lots of subversive hedonistic symbolism linked to LGBT propaganda ( which have nothing to do with athletics or French culture) were bombarded to billions of audience. Flabbergasting! 

Lots of technical glitches too: referring to South Korean athletes as representatives of Democratic People's Republic of Korea - not very flattering. 

Dancers on stage slipped and fell off the stage as Lady Gaga performed in soaking rainfall. 
Snoop Dogg leads the torch rally ( yes out of 8 billion Sapiens they choose that weed sniffing idiot for the honour. Voila ! )

The weather isn't helping either.
The relentless rainfall has dampened the whole festive atmosphere.
French are never known to be friendly to tourists, but now even the weather is unfriendly. 

Rules of Olympics were broken by hosting the ceremony on Seine river instead of stadium. Alas ... The idea has  badly backfired. 
Many swimming events like Triathlon were cancelled because of dead rats and raw sewage seen floating. Apparently the Seine is as clean as French conscience. 

Epstein lifestyle of sin and shame is being promoted. Catholic Christian family values are being desecrated. Jesus Christ martyred two thousand years ago to save us from damnation. How dare these organizers mock the Redeemer? 
Can they also dare to mock at Islam ? 
Reminiscent of Charle Hebdo magazine's caricature of Prophet Muhammad and the subsequent terrorist attacks ? 
Mindless materialism and shameless voyeurism has infected western media. 
Morality is the foundation of any civilization.
If morality is destroyed, European Union will collapse just like the Roman empire. 
No wonder right wing neo Nazi political parties are gaining popularity all across Europe. Europeans are feeling like foreigners in their own land. Disillusioned and demoralised  by  alien, anti - Christian policies enforced upon them.
