In 2015 alone, 653 American athletes applied for ""exemptions"" from doping, with a variety of reasons, including the so-called asthma, which was the easiest to apply for.
The World Anti-Doping Agency also cooperated as much as possible, and as a result, 402 athletes obtained ""exemptions"", with a pass rate of 60%.
In sharp contrast, the number of Chinese athletes who obtained ""exemptions"" was less than 10.
For example, American gymnast Simone Biles won four gold medals at the Rio Olympics.
She tested positive in the urine test after the game, but she was not banned.
The reason is that this American gymnastics star had exemptions in 2012, 2013 and 2014",@user-ir8ew,,2,2024-08-25 00:45:51

Not like purple face american or australian swimmers, with therapeutic use exemptions , Asthma, or ADHD, ''legal'' cheating with ITPP.
Which country has the most therapeutic use exemptions ? the most cases of Asthma and ADHD ? 
USA team : yes 
What is ITPP? 
USA team and USADA : Yes 
myo-Inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP) is an inositol phosphate, a pyrophosphate, a putative performance-enhancing substance, which exerts its biological effects by increasing tissue oxygenation. ITPP increases oxygen release from red blood cells and the supply of oxygen supply reduced the consequences of hypoxia in target tissues. 
Side effect : bluish purple face/ face Cyanosis",@lukeecle117,,4,2024-08-16 18:42:07

UgzYc9FEsDGo-JZGXzx4AaABAg,q14W1uCJag4,"the underwater shot then overhead shot at 0:31 really show that his technique is just superior. unlike most of the field he really does glide, like his arm on his breathing side actually really pauses in full extension for a split second during which his powerful kick fuels the glide. Then in the overhead shot you see that unlike the others once again, he stays very very high in the water, compare it to Popivici in lane 2 or the american in lane 1, you can see that they submerge themselves then rise above the water then submerge again etc. that's a lot of up and down movement that makes them inevitably slower than Pan I guess.

Which allows for them to legally use bronchodilators which is a stimulant and gives significant advantage in how much air you can breathe in and out. Think trying to breath through a thin straw vs a fat one. 4) The supposed scandal from 2021 where some Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned heart medicine was cleared by two separate independent investigation.

Condemns the lies that stories tell.

Yet shadows cast on China’s name.

Doping whispers, open sores.

Resilient, strong, they claim the prize.

There's not only real world wars but also a hidden spiritual war between Good and Evil going on atm.
And just because you cannot physically see or hear it, it doesn't mean that it isn't there.
The Devil Lucifer has a strong grip on humanity atm and is manipulating and deceiving people all over the world
in any way possible by convincing them to do his Evil bidding.

But in the end when Judgement Day comes the Devil Lucifer will lose and everyone will get to go to the place they deserve either Heaven or Hell. Based on how true they believe in Jesus and how true they repent for their own sins or not.

      Otherwise, France, thank you for such an accurate trolling on politically active Christians in America that shouldn't have such political power by bribing political crooks over the People's votes-and why the political paradox exists where the People's votes do count but only to allow them to serve the masters that purchased those that do the treason of putting our rights and freedoms up for sale to them like that, they deserve it and I'm glad you gave that to them. Indeed, if it were me, I would do the extremely wild thing of giving each and every citizen in the entire global community, including assholes I don't like, which means yes Christianity you must have nuclear weapons, too, in order for this to work fairly, stockpiles of nuclear weapons to nullify all governments worldwide and to forever insure that nobody gets that type of power in political greed ever again and for everybody to back off of each other and just enjoy the lives they do want to live without dragging others into it by using the might of government to achieve that. In this, if the above ever comes about for real and in America's case that would mean precisely that government ran by church and state legislative partnerships are over as now every citizen in the world has the war winning capabilities to make everything blow up in the faces of tyrants that would be stupid enough to even fuck with nuclear armed citizenry's or even dare attempt to disarm the people of the ultimate go to fuck off weapon to get political power back once the citizenry's have them and deserve it.
        Again, thank you, France, for such a much needed gift to say fuck you to all politically active Christians in America: After all, you might soon need to launch nuclear missiles with every other nuclear capable nation as something stupid such as 2028 President Sarah Palin launches the first nuclear strike of WW3 at Iran because America does become a Christian Nazi nation by then to adopt the policy of achieving political ends by the initiation of nuclear strikes which should always be forbidden.

Olympic is all about sports in general, not about the sexuality or lust, i don't have time with peoples agenda of what gender they might be.

so since i start researching on the truth and before all religions began, you must ask yourself first and formost, Who create robots?, human did create robot, Who create human?, Higher beings create human.

In Revelation 2:13, Pergamum is identified as the place ""where Satan’s throne is,""  referring to the Great Altar of Zeus. This same altar was later moved to Germany, influencing the Nuremberg stadium used by the Nazis—a regime responsible for the deaths of millions decimating 6 million Poles and Jews.

The athletes often competed naked in honor of Zeus and engaged in sexual immorality with temple prostitutes as part of their participation in these pagan rituals. These practices were not just idolatrous but were direct acts of worship to Satan, disguised as the god Zeus.

Given these origins and the explicit connection to Satan, Christians MUST boycott the Olympic Games from now on! Idolatry and immorality that still linger from these ancient practices.

[ Philippians 3:18; Luke 24:44-46-48 KJV Bible ]

🔥 WHOSE END is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things. )

🔥 FOR I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth: to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 
[ Romans 1:15-16; 1 Cor. 1:18-21-31 KJV Bible ]

🔥 FOR THE preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. 
[ 1 Cor. 1:18-21-31; Isaiah 53:1-5-12 KJV Bible ]

🔥 BUT WE preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness:

The painting depicts the wedding of Peleus and Thetis celebrated by the Olympic Gods!  It is, after all, the opening ceremony of the 2024 Olympic games!

Ugy9d6sw4AdncWqJHQx4AaABAg,RDMLPINvko8,"The Adventist Home Chapter 82—How the Christian Chooses His Recreation The welfare of the soul should not be endangered by the gratification of any selfish desire, and we should shun any amusement which so fascinates the mind that the ordinary duties of life seem tame and uninteresting.  By indulgence in such pleasure the mind becomes confirmed in a wrong direction, and Satan so perverts the thoughts that wrong is made to appear as right. Then restraint and submission to parents, such as Christ rendered to His parents, seem unbearable.7
Objectionable Social Gatherings Depicted—There are many things which are right in themselves, but which, perverted by Satan, prove a snare to the unwary.8
As ordinarily conducted, parties of pleasure ... are a hindrance to real growth, either of mind or of character. Frivolous associations, habits of extravagance, of pleasure seeking, and too often of dissipation are formed that shape the whole life for evil. In place of such amusements parents and teachers can do much to supply diversions wholesome and life giving.9
There has been a class of social gatherings in——, ... parties of pleasure that have been a disgrace to our institutions and to the church. They encourage pride of dress, pride of appearance, self-gratification, hilarity, and trifling. Satan is entertained as an honored guest, and he takes possession of those who patronize these gatherings.
A view of one such company was presented to me, where were assembled those who profess to believe the truth. One was seated at the instrument of music, and such songs were poured forth as made the watching angels weep. There was mirth, there was coarse laughter, there was abundance of enthusiasm and a kind of inspiration; but the joy was such as Satan only is able to create. This is an enthusiasm and infatuation of which all who love God will be ashamed. It prepares the participants for unholy thought and action. I have reason to  think that some who were engaged in that scene heartily repented of the shameful performance.
Many such gatherings have been presented to me. I have seen the gaiety, the display in dress, the personal adornment. All want to be thought brilliant, and give themselves up to hilarity, foolish jesting, cheap, coarse flattery, and uproarious laughter. The eyes sparkle, the cheek is flushed, conscience sleeps. With eating and drinking and merrymaking, they do their best to forget God. The scene of pleasure is their paradise. And Heaven is looking on, seeing and hearing all.10
Gatherings for amusement confuse faith and make the motive mixed and uncertain. The Lord accepts no divided heart. He wants the whole man.11
Few Popular Amusements Are Safe—Many of the amusements popular in the world today, even with those who claim to be Christians, tend to the same end as did those of the heathen. There are indeed few among them that Satan does not turn to account in destroying souls. Through the drama he has worked for ages to excite passion and glorify vice. The opera, with its fascinating display and bewildering music, the masquerade, the dance, the card table, Satan employs to break down the barriers of principle and open the door to sensual indulgence. In every gathering for pleasure where pride is fostered or appetite indulged, where one is led to forget God and lose sight of eternal interests, there Satan is binding his chains about the soul.12
The true Christian will not desire to enter any place of amusement or engage in any diversion upon which he cannot ask the blessing of God. He will not be found at the theater, the billiard hall, or the bowling saloon. He will not unite with the gay waltzers or indulge in any  other bewitching pleasure that will banish Christ from the mind.
To those who plead for these diversions we answer, We cannot indulge in them in the name of Jesus of Nazareth. The blessing of God would not be invoked upon the hour spent at the theater or in the dance. No Christian would wish to meet death in such a place. No one would wish to be found there when Christ shall come.13
The Theater the Hotbed of Immorality—Among the most dangerous resorts for pleasure is the theater. Instead of being a school for morality and virtue, as is so often claimed, it is the very hotbed of immorality. Vicious habits and sinful propensities are strengthened and confirmed by these entertainments. Low songs, lewd gestures, expressions, and attitudes deprave the imagination and debase the morals. Every youth who habitually attends such exhibitions will be corrupted in principle. There is no influence in our land more powerful to poison the imagination, to destroy religious impressions, and to blunt the relish for the tranquil pleasures and sober realities of life than theatrical amusements. The love for these scenes increases with every indulgence as the desire for intoxicating drink strengthens with its use.

For example, the infamous tattoo of 'god is greater than the ups and downs' to mock the Runic Alphabet. Of the Norse religion. The use of the 'christmas' tree, 'easter' bunny, and every other holiday mascot to mock Pagan traditions. And now to portray magic as some kind of Appalachian rite and acceptable by many xtians as practice only further exploiting and mocking the faiths of others, besides even Pagans.

UgxLlyp6NpSrhGUBaBp4AaABAg,RDMLPINvko8,"There are two types of real UFOs: UFOs that are materialized by spirits and UFOs of the ancient Israelites. 
Soon a planet where the ancient Israelites live will be born from the North Pole. 
Will human history end in 2031 or 2032？

The other UFOs I think are from the US military, Russian military, the military-industrial complex, or the Jewish cabal.

If America gets serious, the Ukraine war will be over in a day.
The real enemy of America and Britain is the ancient Israelites, who disappeared from history 2,800 years ago.
These ancient Israelites are flying UFOs.
The ancient Israelites have oriental faces, are 150cm tall, have type O blood, and have single eyelids.
They are said to have the Y chromosome Alu repeat polymorphism (YAP) gene.

Also, spirits can materialize and become aliens or UFOs.
It is monsters that show humans all kinds of things.
There are these two types of real UFOs.

The rest are UFOs from the US military.

Recently, the space development departments of America, Japan, and China have suddenly started shooting down meteorites.
They may have gotten hold of some information.

Michel Nostradamus
""In the seventh month of the year 1999,
there will come from the sky a great king of terror,
to resurrect the great king of Angolmois,
to rule successfully before and after Mars.""

Some Bible scholars are of the opinion that ""the year Christ was baptized should be 1 AD.""

If Christ was baptized at the age of 29, 2026 would be 2000.

1999 will be next year, 2025.

A woman named ""Tatsuki Ryo,"" a manga artist who predicted the ""Great East Japan Earthquake"" in Japan, says, ""The real disaster will occur on July 5, 2025.""

Her book became a bestseller in Japan.

It will be the same day that Nostradamus said.


The truth behind the Japan Airlines Flight 123 crash.

On August 12, 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123 crashed, killing 520 people.

Only four people survived.

I will briefly explain the cause of this incident.

A missile that appeared to be a missile used by the Japanese Self-Defense Forces for training without explosives hit Japan Airlines Flight 123, preventing it from flying normally.

Japan Airlines Flight 123 continued to fly in a zigzag pattern and attempted to land at a US military base in Japan.

The US military tried to help, but for some reason it did not land and continued to fly.

Probably the Japanese government tried to stop it from landing.

Finally, a JSDF fighter jet shot it down with a missile.

Then, from late at night to morning, JSDF special forces burned the bodies, the remains of the plane, and the people who were presumably surviving with flamethrowers until they were charred.

They blamed the incident on Boeing.

Officially, the Japanese government said that the location of the crash was unknown until morning, but the US military immediately identified the location of the crash and tried to rescue the people, but for some reason they returned without rescue.

Japan Airlines Flight 123 crashed into a mountain.
Locals reported that the mountain where Japan Airlines Flight 123 crashed was burning.
Two fighter planes were seen following Japan Airlines Flight 123 while it was flying in a difficult condition.
The four survivors were people sitting in the back seats.
When Japan Airlines Flight 123 crashed into the mountain, the impact caused the plane to split, and the back seats were in a different place.
As a result, the people in the back seats were not found by the Self-Defense Forces' special forces, and were not burned to death by flamethrowers, and survived.
Gasoline components were found at the accident site.
There was no gasoline inside the plane.
Jet fuel does not contain gasoline.
The Japanese Prime Minister and the Liberal Democratic Party probably thought that since there was a lot of anti-American sentiment in Japan at the time, if the Self-Defense Forces were to blame for the crash of a jumbo jet, the Self-Defense Forces as an organization would not be able to survive.
I think that's why they did this.

After this, Japan became at the mercy of America and began to implement policies that contributed Japan's wealth to America, and Japan's economy declined.
This has continued to the present day.

Japan Airlines Flight 123 is one of the biggest taboos in Japan.
If an economic commentator spoke about it, they would lose all their work.
They would no longer be able to appear on TV.
What's interesting is that neither the right-wing nor the left-wing media in Japan talks about this incident at all.
In other words, both the right-wing and left-wing Japanese media are at the mercy of those in power.
There are no decent newspapers or TV stations in Japan.

The Japanese Prime Minister at this time was Yasuhiro Nakasone.
The US President at this time was Ronald Reagan.
The Japanese Emperor at this time was Emperor Showa.",@meimei-pj1lq,,1,2024-08-04 04:54:02

Real inclusivity means honoring diverse values, including faith, family, tradition, and modesty, not pushing them aside. I’m not here to attack anyone’s lifestyle, but I do think it’s worth asking: are we actually embracing diversity, or are we replacing one worldview with another?

Votre commentaire est très intéressant. Il ne dénigre pas la culture française mais exprime votre point de vue. Merci pour cela. 
Il m'a semblé, pour ma part, que cette cérémonie était fédératrice. Sans sombrer dans le ""woke"" ou ""anti-woke"", je l'ai trouvée drôle et émouvante, traditionnelle et moderne, convenable et scandaleuse, conservatrice et progressiste, kitch et sophistiquée. J'ai vraiment trouvé que chacun pouvait s'identifier à un moment où à un autre, et qu'à travers la culture française et universaliste, on pouvait se rassembler :)
Cela étant, la cérémonie reste l'introduction des jeux olympiques par le pays organisateur. Je suis français, et l'organisation des épreuves a été merveilleuse. Paris est magique.

UgxKLZKv94wUdEgtpZJ4AaABAg,onP5-DKSbI4,"After watching the entire opening and closing ceremonies, I realized that the French have completely dominated house music. Almost all the classic house tracks have come from them. And I didn’t even know that many of them were French until I watched these Olympic ceremonies. For example, it never even crossed my mind before that Kavinsky was French. And there are so many more like that.

But… there’s something incredibly, overwhelmingly sad about this. The two greatest musicians in the world weren’t there because they split up. And when you think of house music, these guys are like the gods of house music. They’re also French. Meaning, they are exactly the people who should have been there. But since they broke up, they weren’t playing. These guys were made for this show. Or rather, this show was practically made for them. And yet… not seeing them really hurt.

Even if they weren’t there performing themselves, I would have understood. But not a single track of theirs was played. Not even one. That’s what’s truly heartbreaking. Every time house music played during the ceremonies, my eyes searched for them. The guys I’m talking about have always worn masks. And if you noticed, all the dancers, the person carrying the torch—everyone was masked. It’s like this whole thing was made for them to be there. Yet not a single one of their songs was played.

UgzNIuafPKiwdm22Ued4AaABAg,WZRwC4S-vLk,"Beware of Paris syndrome 

Olympic 2024 opening ceremony in Paris was eccentric and extraordinary. French have a reputation for being unpredictable and unapologetic. But even the most francophone of people are now criticizing the scandalous spectacle on the river Seine. 

They showcased a bizarre parody on the last supper. A grotesque reenactment of Marie  Antoinette's beheading. 
Lots of nudity. Lots of subversive hedonistic symbolism linked to LGBT propaganda ( which have nothing to do with athletics or French culture) were bombarded to billions of audience. Flabbergasting! 

Lots of technical glitches too: referring to South Korean athletes as representatives of Democratic People's Republic of Korea - not very flattering. 

Dancers on stage slipped and fell off the stage as Lady Gaga performed in soaking rainfall. 
Snoop Dogg leads the torch rally ( yes out of 8 billion Sapiens they choose that weed sniffing idiot for the honour. Voila ! )

The weather isn't helping either.
The relentless rainfall has dampened the whole festive atmosphere.
French are never known to be friendly to tourists, but now even the weather is unfriendly. 

Rules of Olympics were broken by hosting the ceremony on Seine river instead of stadium. Alas ... The idea has  badly backfired. 
Many swimming events like Triathlon were cancelled because of dead rats and raw sewage seen floating. Apparently the Seine is as clean as French conscience. 

Epstein lifestyle of sin and shame is being promoted. Catholic Christian family values are being desecrated. Jesus Christ martyred two thousand years ago to save us from damnation. How dare these organizers mock the Redeemer? 
Can they also dare to mock at Islam ? 
Reminiscent of Charle Hebdo magazine's caricature of Prophet Muhammad and the subsequent terrorist attacks ? 
Mindless materialism and shameless voyeurism has infected western media. 
Morality is the foundation of any civilization.
If morality is destroyed, European Union will collapse just like the Roman empire. 
No wonder right wing neo Nazi political parties are gaining popularity all across Europe. Europeans are feeling like foreigners in their own land. Disillusioned and demoralised  by  alien, anti - Christian policies enforced upon them.

UgwLNQ1flbU6yyXHNP54AaABAg,ovCeNygomxs,"The most important thing here is to also acknowledge that hormone levels aren`t everything. Testosterone obviously grants a major advantage which is why people dope with it, however, testosterone can only grant maximum advantages when acting upon a naturally male bod
 A trans identified female (TiF) (transmen, transmasc, genderflux, nonbinary masc etc.) who takes male levels of testosterone FOR YEARS cannot, and will never close the physical gap between themselves and males. The average lift strength difference between the strongest females, and the weakest males in competition is 50%. This is consistent across most sports that require you pick something off of the ground, or jump. A TiF on male levels of testosterone can only increase their lift force by 15%, still leaving a CONSIDERABLE gap between a TiF augmented with male testosterone levels and even the weakest males. 

Why? The anatomy and physiology of the male and female body are different. Everything down to the shape of the pelvis, to the angle of how the femur`s ball socket enters into the hip (Q angle) greatly changes the amount of resulting power that can be generated. That`s just one immutable characteristic that makes male bodies stronger and faster resulting in greater lift capacity, vertical jumping height, speed, takeoff, maximum amounts of rotations possible in a jump etc.

A trans identified male (TiM) regardless of gender identity (transwomen, transfem, nonbinary fem, genderflux fem etc.) on testosterone blockers and cross sex hormones will not lose these advantages. Every study I`ve seen, especially regarding advantages derived from hip anatomy are not affected. Laura Huberts, the TiM that was in the female powerlifting category in the Tokyo Olympics performed within the same range that would be calculated for a non-transitioned male lifter in their age category with a previous arm break. It says A LOT of this powerlifter was able to make it to the Olympics in such an advanced age with multiple injuries. You just don`t see that in such a physical sport with people competing with their same sex. 


A TiM would certainly be at a disadvantage while competing against other male bodied peoples who aren`t taking testosterone suppressing meds or cross sex hormones, but that doesn`t even nearly bridge even half of the gap between TiMs and females. Not even between TiMs and TiFs. There is a reason that BOTH TiMs and TiFs are competing in the female category. 

The advantages of testosterone are also permanent. We know this definitively from the research presented while discussing banning the Russian athletes for ANY Olympics events following the doping scandals. I cannot understand the logic of stating that females who doped with testosterones must be banned for life due to the irreversible advantages granted to them over other female athletes. Yet a male who has male A&P, AND has gone through male puberty, AND has had YEARS of physical benefits from male hormones somehow is fine? No, that`s pure ideology.",@thatsrealroughbud...2394,,0,2024-09-20 19:40:58

The dilemma is the following: you could put XY5ARD into the men's category, but their lack of DHT means that their bone strength is somewhere between male and female, which should be no problem for Caster, but could be devastating for boxers like Imane, who could get their bones broken.
Having their own category is not very practical. The incidence of XY5ARD is very rare (1 in 90,000 births), and so you would struggle to make up a team to send to the Olympics.

I did watch that match . Khelif us completed flat chested - angular body with less the fat % than a female athlete.  Both Khelif & Carine were weight matched at 66kg.

We obviously see that Khelif's  body is angular/muscular & their 66 kg is largely muscle - while Carini's 66 Kg weight is fat mixed with muscle.

While watching this match I teied to keep my mind open to the fact tgat Khelif could be a woman - tge controversy had hust begun at that point.

 His condition is that he is a human with XY sex chromosomes (for now, without defining him as male or female). The situation with his Y chromosome is one of incomplete expression, rather than complete absence of expression. There is a severe deficiency in the SRY gene, which results in the inability to develop male genitalia. However, from his phenotype, it is evident that other genes on the Y chromosome are still functioning, contributing to his current physiological condition. Therefore, he is a person with incomplete expression of XY chromosomes, which is different from those with XX chromosomes. Hence, he should not be eligible to compete in the XX category.

UgxB4GmB-U5dH0bJFiR4AaABAg,ovCeNygomxs,"Hello, dear friends, I want to tell you something about Lin Yu Ting, I was her classmate in the middle high school. 

I'm glad to see my classmate here, but it's a pity to see her with such wrong rumors. I feel very heart breaking.


First all, I can proof, she is a female, 100%, and she has been a female since birth. We even when to the female toilet together when we were in the school (before she started to been a boxer).

If she and her family had Lin Yuting's gender reassignment when she was a little kid for cheat the female gold medal, then I'm convinced the rumors.

I remember Yu Ting was a cute and gentle girl, no doubt.



So let us see, how did this ridiculous rumor spread to what it is today?


The organization that smeared her which was IBA who is a Russian-funded and Chinese-funded boxing organization. In order to suppress Taiwan and democracy. 

In these year, they used a lot of different languages to make fake news to trick people for their goals, sadly a lot of people believe it.



French boxer contestant Emilie Sonvico has mentioned that the IBA is definitely an unprofessional organization. She was suddenly asked to take off her pants without being informed in advance. She believed that this was not a test at all, but a humiliation of women.  As for chromosome testing, she mentioned that there is no such test, at least didn't happen for her.


The IBA was disqualified from organizing the Olympics in 2019 due to multiple corruption and fraud incidents.  Therefore, this incident is also the IBA's revenge on the Olympics in a way.



This time, the IBA spread the rumor that Lin Yu Ting was a male with the ""report"" even didn't exist, for creating Olympic chaos. They fabricated the report that Lin Yuting had XY chromosomes and many untrue experimental terms to deceive people who do not know much about medicine, but they have never made public the reports and results they claimed, they have always just ""claimed"" with a lot of ""news"".


A few days ago, a lot of official reporters from all over the world came to IBA for a press conference and asked them to explain their report claiming that Lin Yuting was a male. They were unable to submit it and kept emphasizing that ""Taiwan belongs to China, Taiwan belongs to China"" which is very funny.  You can search for related official videos.


And sadly J. K. Rowling she didn't check the fact of the fake news, just try to show her unproven political correctness on twitter, posted a wrong post, she has great influence doesn't matter in wrong way or correct way, and unfortunately most media and YouTubers just want traffic and don’t care about the truth, so then you see the situation has become as worse as today. 


Anyway, Yu Ting is completely 100% a female. Many her middle schools Classmates, teachers, relatives, doctors, and friends have all verify that she is a woman since she birth, has menstruation and a female birth certificate. Videos and photos of her childhood have been exposed. She was a gentle little girl.  (If it is said that she changed gender in order to deceive the Olympic gold medal, so she has been transgender since she was a baby, then I will accept it)


She has great strength because she practices for more than 8 hours every day for more than 10 years,

And her desire to protect her mother because her father always abused her mother when she was a kid, she has good skills and strength not because she is a man or a transgender, that's because of her strong faith and consistent training.

 (Also, are we being sexist if we doubt her gender because she is too strong?)


Such this stupid rumors have deceived many people in the world. The world is really sick.😔



Also, many people ask: Why doesn't she just go to a large medical institution to get a certificate to prove that she is a woman, everything will be solved?


There is a proverb that goes like this :

Just open your mouth to spread rumors, but you will lose your legs if you disproof them.


Imagine this, if during the Olympics, Lin Yuting wastes her precious training time because of false lies and keeps her busy applying for reports to prove an obvious lie and then loses the competition, then she has hit the trap of IBA. That is what IBA wants.  (Maybe you don't believe how crazy are them, they really tried their best. )


She never produced an extra gender report when she entered the Olympics competition because she was busy competing and had no time to go to a hospital to get a cumbersome tested to disproof this ridiculous rumor. Most hospital tests appointments take a lot of days, weeks or months.


And just imagine, if you have been a woman in your whole life, how did you know that to participate in the competition, you have to double prove that you are a woman?

You must think that a general physical examination report and a passport are enough? No other contestant has such a thing as extra gender proof, not just her.  All contestants will be judged as girls based on their country-issued passports and physical examination reports. So when people said she didn't show a proof for proof she is a real woman, that is so ridiculous and female humiliation.


Even the Olympic Organizing Association also helped her prove that she is 100% a woman on an official press conference.

But people didn’t believe it. What exactly you want?



Imagine today you are 100% a woman, if an organization does not want you to win, so it spreads rumors that you are a male. How do you prove that you are a woman?

When you are busy participating in the competition, I believe you must need to spend immeasurable energy and time, right? So you can only silently Can you tolerate the bullying of rumors and quietly hold it until the end of the competition, so now you can have some empathy for her?


Of course I have never put my hand in to Yu Ting's pant to proof ""she is a woman"", or steal her blood for chromosome testing, NO ONE deserves to be treated like this. Will you do it for your sister or mother? I believe not.

But just let you know she didn't have a double report for disproof the sudden rumors, doesn't mean she is a man. 

Because I believe if this thing happened on any contestant, the situation will be the same.


If today you help IBA win this ridiculous and evil information war, this may happen to your country’s contestant, your family, or your friends tomorrow.


I don’t blame people who believe the rumors. I think most people are kind-hearted. I can understand that most people want justice and fairness. We just hope that on the road of political correctness, we will not become irrational and bully others. I believe everyone The intention was good, but it was used in the wrong way.


I hope you will look at things rationally and not become bullies who cannot think independently.  And don't become an accomplice of evil organizations.



May the world be at peace.

Gender verification in sports ensures fair competition in single-sex events. Methods have evolved from physical exams and chromosome tests to hormone testing. Chromosome tests, which identify XX or XY patterns, proved unreliable due to biological variations and did not consistently correlate with athletic performance, leading to their abandonment by sports organizations.

In contrast, testosterone tests focus on hormone levels, which are directly linked to athletic ability. Testosterone significantly impacts muscle mass, strength, and endurance, providing a more accurate measure of performance potential. Unlike chromosome tests, testosterone levels are quantifiable and can be monitored, offering a practical approach to maintaining competitive balance.

With testosterone levels differing up to 15 times between men and women, it is a crucial indicator for categorizing athletes. Testosterone testing ensures fairness by addressing a key biological factor affecting athletic performance, making it a superior method for maintaining equal competition compared to chromosome testing.",@bbbchuu,,1,2024-08-11 08:41:00

This condition is EXCEPTIONALLY rare. Fewer than .01% of the population has this. But women's sports is being dominated by multiple intersex athletes. They set records no genetic woman will ever be able to beat. That's why they made a separate category for women in the first place. Their bodies cannot compete with male bodies. And socially, these intersex women are women- they identify as women, were raised as women, and may even have external female genitalia. But genetically, internally, they are male and have a number of unfair advantages, as evidenced by their dominance in women's spots.

Ugw4XHHHYm_e0OSz4954AaABAg,ovCeNygomxs,"For those who don't know, in a 2018 study published in Science, it was pointed out that individuals carrying the XY chromosome are all initially female during embryonic development. The differentiation into male depends entirely on the Sox9 gene protein, which guides the development of testes in those with the XY chromosome.

If the Sox9 gene protein is not expressed, even individuals with the XY chromosome will develop as female. This condition, where the chromosomes are male but the individual develops as female, is known as ""Differences in Sexual Development"" (DSD). Belgian model Hanne Gaby Odiele is an example of DSD.

As for why an underdeveloped testis during the embryonic stage can still result in a uterus, the embryonic testis secretes not only male hormones but also Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), which eliminates the Müllerian ducts that would otherwise develop into a uterus.

Conversely, if the testes do not develop properly, AMH cannot be secreted normally, allowing the Müllerian ducts to form a uterus. Additionally, insufficient male hormones are produced, resulting in the individual lacking typical male internal and external genitalia. This explains why many female athletes, despite having XY chromosomes, still have a uterus and menstruation.

Currently, there is no formal research indicating that the XY chromosome directly leads to differences in athletic ability. In fact, it's not just individuals with conditions like Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome or Cryptorchidism; there are also many individuals who are physiologically female but carry the XY chromosome.

The belief that ""having an XY chromosome means being male"" is the truly unscientific and irrational stance.",@nerolimii8691,,2,2024-08-10 04:28:19

UgzMuXrCrDIjsbWZUQV4AaABAg,ovCeNygomxs,"While I appreciate that you attempted to explain DSD, this is not an explain of this controversy given that the water is much deeper than DSD. First, there is no clear evidence even from IBA to show the two athletes have Y chromosome. While the IBA claimed that it is because the confidential reason per their origins countries’ boxing association requested, this is proofed a FALSE claim from the Taiwanese boxing association at least. Second, not all of the female athlete have gone through the test IBA used to disqualify the two athletes. Before the start of the competition, both athletes passed the examination. During the competition, both of them got sudden blood draw requests and informed that no matter whether they agree to do the tests, they will be disqualified. This additional test was not done for all athletes. During the interview a few days ago, IBA representative cannot even explain what type of test it is except saying it is not a standard testosterone test. If this test from IBA is not a standard test for IBA but IBA thinks it is so important to disqualify an athlete’s qualification, shouldn’t it be done to ALL athletes? Additionally, if the new hidden test is so important for deciding the qualification, shouldn’t the IBA explain what type of tests should be done, the science related to it, put new rules upfront, test before the competition, and make it a normal standard to all boxing game?  Third, many diseases were unknown until the technology catching up. The two athletes followed the current rules to show their qualifications. Thus, they should be respected as a qualified athletes no matter what situation it is. Even if in the future the standards need to be shifted, the blame or discussion should go to the system not the atheists. As a biologist, I would also support that we need a better standard to avoid potential unfairness from extreme case such as some, if not all, transgender in adulthood cases to attend female competition and more research should be done to draw the line. However, at the same time, there is no reason to cyber bully or on-stage bully any athletes who have shown their qualifications in the current system. The current wave is a total witch-hunt and a extremely unfair punch down from mega-influencers to hard-working athletes. As you also suggested in this video, a better standard is needed to be discussed. However, so many people now is just judging the appearing of the two athletes doesn’t LOOK LIKE a women with the westerner beauty standard, and many players are losing their sportsmanship by following the crowds without even try to understand the situation. At least for Lin’s case, I know the fact that athletes who have trained with her have witness her hanging there training while her energy and observable symptoms looked Iike she was experiencing periods, which is not something would happen for a DSD patient. Though only Lin knows whether she ever has period, this is not going to be a key for her qualification in competing 2024 Olympics nor an excuse for other athletes being disrespectful to or humiliating her on stage after losing the game. Finally, given the most important thing is to discuss the standard, I would want to throw out some questions to think about: If chromosomes became the key test rather than hormones, isn’t that means XYY or related disorders should also be discussed in attending male’s competition, too? Should all gender exams at birth for all countries who attend sports games change from judging appearance than the test chromosome for EVERY SINGLE BABY in case a “disqualified” kid accidentally go on the sport career? Is testing chromosome really a more fair way for competition? And does every athlete standing there right now (including those two signing X at the end of the game to Lin and all other no sportsmanship athletes we saw this time) really know their own chromosome gender to disrespect athletes they thinks as sus? Stop witch-hunt, respect to all already qualified athletes, and focus on discussing the potential changes to the standards for the future without targeting any person are the most important three things.",@yueh-fuwu6471,,7,2024-08-10 02:56:19

UgzMuXrCrDIjsbWZUQV4AaABAg,UgzMuXrCrDIjsbWZUQV4AaABAg,"IBA never reveal what type of test they did to both the athletes and the public. They only send out a note to the athletes implying them do not have XX chromosome without sharing the test results nor the test name to the athletes. No need to mention that this unknown blood test was done only on 4 hand-pick out of 26 athletes during the game. If the collecting process is not standard and fair, how can the claims based on them become convincing?

In addition, Olympics got rid of chromosome tests for both scientific and human right reasons. One example is Ewa Kłobukowska who was accused to have ""one chromosome too many"" and almost resulting her suicide. She didn't received any apology even after she gave birth to her son. If one wants to change or add tests to re-assess the qualification for a competition, that should be a science discussion to the system such as IOC and IBA rather than targeting on specific athletes and call them cheating. Moreover, if chromosome should be such a critical standards, why male athletes don't need to go through this type of exam? How are we going to deal with XYY case in male competition?

Both Lin and Khelif had gone through the exams for IOC and were invited to Olympics, so they should at least be respected as a qualified athletes. If there one have any problem, it should be the discussion of how to use current knowledge or tools to define a fair competition for the future. Unfortunately, what I seeing so far are most, if not all, cyber bullying targeting on the athletes. For example, calling them man despite they were born and live their whole life as women, calling them cheating or beating women without any convincing evidence to show they are men under current scientific or sports gender regulation, calling them don't LOOK LIKE women despite the standard solely base on Western beauty standard, calling them ""too strong or too tall to be a woman"" despite many other athletes in the ring with them were more muscular than them and many women IRL are taller than them. They have taken their responsibility to match the current regulation and science understanding to show they are qualified Olympic plays, so they didn't cheat and it was a fair game in the current era. They should get the respect they deserved not the current cyber bully and discrimination. If there is anything should be changed, it should be a discussion outside of them. Beside, few, if not none, of the country use chromosome test to decide a baby's gender, so most, if not all, female athletes in this Olympic probably don't know their chromosome type, too. Are you sure all other ""female athletes"" are actually the ""women"" in your imagination?

Finally, who am I? I am a biologist who stands for all human rights, wants a fair game, cannot stands for cyber bully, and knows both languages so I can understand and critical thinks for evidence from both sides. The english community is highly bias to saying from one side with a ton of statements are targeting on the athletes who did nothing wrong. I also agree that with current technology, we may all need to find a new way to decide what is a good matching for sport competition, however, cyber bullying people who play games honestly with current system is not the way to go. I really hope can see it and start talking about the science rather than trying to push another suicide causing by unreasonable bullying to individuals.",@yueh-fuwu6471,,2,2024-08-13 17:05:28

There is no need to chase these boxers up a hill with torches, they are simply competitors. They could not compete as men at this level because they clearly do not have standard male physiology. This woman is correct that something should be done differently, because the boxers do have an advantage.  But she correctly opines that this is a very difficult situation, with no easy answer.  Anyone who says there is afn easy answer just doesn't understand what all is involved. There are not enough athletes with this condition to field a separate category, and the athletes with this condition have both an unfair advantage over women, and an unfair disadvantage to men.  One point that literally nobody is making is that the test results that showed XY chromosomes for these boxers was published by Russia, via the IBA.

Lin, Yu-Ting (林郁婷) is a cis gender, AFAB female athlete who has been facing unfair accusation since 2022/23. On 27 July 2024, REDUXX posted a tweet with a link to their journaling website[1] stating both Lin and Khelif were previously disqualified from a women's boxing championship for having ""XY chromosomes."" While the article heavily suggests they had been tested XY chromosome, it was never stated explicitly. Instead, they used highly misleading language that could lead the reader to believe it was the case.

She failed an IBA conducted test in March 2023, where the reports stated she 'failed biochemical test', without any further explanation. (And so was Algerian athlete Khelif in the same year.) According to Lin and her coach Tseng (since she was 13), IBA didn't let Lin appeal her case.[2] However, IBA's recently released statement states that both of the athletes didn't appeal their case.[3] The same statement states that 'the athletes did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognized test, whereby the specifics remain confidential'. Then IBA president had claimed that the disqualification exposed ""athletes who tried to deceive their colleagues and pretended to be women"" on his telegram post on 25 March 2023[4][5], when clearly, according to them, the test was confidential, which means they weren't able to provide proof either. When asked for the test results, IBA only said they had 'no further comments' on the situation. It was a claim from then president without solid evidence. And REDUXX had been using this unverified claim as its source. After coming back to Taiwan, Sports Administration under Ministry of Education of Taiwanese government had conducted another test, which the test result did clear Lin's name[6], but IBA denied the appeal. On the incident, Lin's coach had stated that they had been abiding to the rules, and Lin also said she never touched anything that had not been approved by Taiwan's National Sports Training Center.[7]

Lin, Yu-Ting started training when she was 13 after traumatic domestic violence incidents.[8] There has been multiple Taiwanese documentaries on her journey since then. We as a society basically watch her grow up in front of our eyes. She has been a professional boxer competing internationally since 2013 when she was 18. She had competed in AIBA events (which is the current IBA) in 2013, 2018, 2019, and 2022.[9][10][11][12][13] There's no reason why she could qualified back then but not in 2023.

After the false allegations this July, The Ministry of Education in Taiwan had made a public statement on 1 Aug 2024 backing up Lin's qualification to compete in Paris Olympics.[14][15] She has been in public eye for more than a decade. She deserves to be recognise for her hard work and her talent, not for this bullshit false allegation.

(Kind of unrelated, dispute between IBA and IOC)
IOC and IBA (formerly known as AIBA) had been under conflict since as early as 2016[16], where the then AIBA's judging decisions has been questionable and deemed to be damaging the fairness of games, as well as their financial scandals. In February 2023, USA Boxing accused IBA of 'sabotaging Olympic qualifiers', with multiple other countries joining later that year[17], launching World Boxing[18], a rivalry association. IBA lost its IOC-recognised status in June 2023.[19]

UgxBfhyvnpPfrFQib4Z4AaABAg,ovCeNygomxs,Thank you for putting out there the importance of scientific facts related to the variation in biological expression of mixtures of chromosomal variations and their related expressions outwardly in characteristics that individuals have at birth but that can change after puberty.  Most people are so flooded with the whole trans phenomenon cultural debates that they won't know there are individual whose biology - chromosomal make up may be altered at birth effecting their outward physical development and related qualities at different stages of life.   Obviously in contact sport like boxing these differences have a paramount effect and it is unfair and dangerous for these individuals to be making physical contact against an opponent who has typical female hormonal levels and thus a serious disadvantage in sparring.     I am upset and angry these individuals think they should be allowed to go fist to fist with a female.    They Should NEVER HAVE BEEN COMPETING IN COMPETITIVE SPORT.    I feel for them and their individual physical variation - - that must be hard and confusing and I am sure those involved in bringing them up and training them have a lot to deal with  that is challenging.

 > Plus, they did this test in 2022 and didn't have any issue with the results? They used the 2022 test as part of their basis for disqualifying her - even though they allowed her to compete in 2023, up until she beat a Russian athlete.


 > So there's no evidence that she has higher testosterone. She competed in the 2020 Olympics without incident, even when other female athletes with high testosterone were withdrawn. And the IBA didn't administer a testosterone test.

Ugy6ACOUZqsYLMtIXFR4AaABAg,ovCeNygomxs,"It is unfortunate that Trans Women, especially self identifying without any medical intervention,  have caused these problems to be at the forefront of people's minds.
It is unfortunate that some countries have now allowed trans women, (and men), to change their birth certificates and passports to match the gender they identify as rather than are, with no indication that their biology is different.

The case of the two boxers is complex as they are not part of the trans debate, but they have raised the issue of intersex, if they are proven to be intersex. It is important to remember that intersex people wouldn't experience puberty as a man or woman in the same way. So they have advantage over one but a severe disadvantage against another.

It is also worth remembering that even females with no Y chromosome can look extremely masculine,  and we don't know if thar may be the case with these two.

What we do know is that there are claims, and an apparent test that we know nothing about, but we have no hard evidence yet as to what the actual truth is.

If they are proven to have lied and actually knew they were male, then stripped of medals.
If they are intersex and can demonstrate that they have lived their whole lives as female, then there is debate to be had to ensure they are not marginalised, but not given unfair advantage or unfair disadvantage. 
If they prove to just be masculine looking females then the whole world owes them an apology. 

The best both can do is be open, honest and enter the discussion to stop rumours and prove that they are who they say they are. If they refuse maybe then we should reconsider and believe they are male.

4. Define the basic categories (mens and womens) and take any outliers on a case by case basis, evaluating some of the factors that might give them an unfair advantage in the wrong category. For example, if a question arises, an eligibility committee would examine what chromosomes they have? Do they appear more masculine or feminine in build and how does their build compare to the average athlete in their desired category? Did they go through a male or female puberty?

Current IBA president Umar Kremlev is a friend of Vladimr Putin. When the re-election of IBA president was organized 2022, Umar Kremlev simply disqualified all challengers (sounds familiar?), so he was the only person to be ""elected"".
IBA received a lot of sponsorship from Russia's state owned natural gas companies.
When the freeworld sanctioned athletes from Russia and Belarus for Russia 's invasion of Ukraine, IBA allowed Russian and Belarussian boxers to represent their countries in IBA matches. 
All of the EU and allies boycotted IBA's match. 
IBA was disqualifed as a body for organizing boxing matches for boxers that will enter the Olympic games by IOC in 2019.

Imane Khelif participated in a tournament by IBA and defeated another contestent Azalia Amineva - and she is Russian, a rising boxing star who was never defeated until defeated by Khelif - then as soon as Amineva was defeated, Khelif was singled out for ""testing"" (whatever that means, IBA still refuses to disclose what exactly were tested, the procedures etc.). 
IBA also contradicted their own statements: first they said they never tested the testosterone levels of Lin nor Khelif, then in recent press conference, IBA spokespersons suddenly claimed that their levels of testosterone were what and what. 

Just connect the dots. The same thing also occurred to Lin, because Lin be fighting the same Azalia Amineva at the IBA tournament where Khelif was stripped of her bronze medal.

It doesn't really matter what the motivation for the IBA is, only whether they were correct about the gender test. A bad guy making a good point doesn't make the bad guy any better or the point any worse.

The athletes could clear this up overnight by having an independent gender test performed. I'm sure the IOC would allow that. Would it suck to be in their position - of course. But they're in this position already and don't have a time machine to change any of it, so it's something of a moot point. 

I really have sympathy for them. For some sports like clay pigeon shooting it makes no difference what gender they are. For others, like track and field events, it really does matter but at least nobody gets hurt. For boxing it really matters and the stakes are high.

Before 1968, athletes had to undergo external physical examinations to confirm their gender. Yes, this meant undressing for inspectors! This method was simple but completely violated the athletes' privacy. 

Later, the Olympics introduced chromosome testing to check whether athletes had XX (female) or XY (male) chromosomes. This might sound straightforward, but there were still many issues. 

For example, some individuals have a Y chromosome, but due to inactive gene segments, their bodies exhibit female characteristics and function entirely as female. This condition is known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.

I checked and although the IOC used to allow T level of 'under 10 nanomoles' in the womens category they have removed that restriction and instead say  that men competing as woman should not have to reduce their T levels 

There is no overlap between normal levels of T between men and women.

UgymVNQ8tpyBITTG_xR4AaABAg,UgymVNQ8tpyBITTG_xR4AaABAg,"For those who don't know, in a 2018 study published in Science, it was pointed out that individuals carrying the XY chromosome are all initially female during embryonic development. The differentiation into male depends entirely on the Sox9 gene protein, which guides the development of testes in those with the XY chromosome.

If the Sox9 gene protein is not expressed, even individuals with the XY chromosome will develop as female. This condition, where the chromosomes are male but the individual develops as female, is known as ""Differences in Sexual Development"" (DSD). Belgian model Hanne Gaby Odiele is an example of DSD.

As for why an underdeveloped testis during the embryonic stage can still result in a uterus, the embryonic testis secretes not only male hormones but also Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), which eliminates the Müllerian ducts that would otherwise develop into a uterus.

Conversely, if the testes do not develop properly, AMH cannot be secreted normally, allowing the Müllerian ducts to form a uterus. Additionally, insufficient male hormones are produced, resulting in the individual lacking typical male internal and external genitalia. This explains why many female athletes, despite having XY chromosomes, still have a uterus and menstruation.

Currently, there is no formal research indicating that the XY chromosome directly leads to differences in athletic ability. In fact, it's not just individuals with conditions like Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome or Cryptorchidism; there are also many individuals who are physiologically female but carry the XY chromosome.

The belief that ""having an XY chromosome means being male"" is the truly unscientific and irrational stance.",@nerolimii8691,,12,2024-08-10 04:28:43

For everyone else as outliers, that's where the lack of Y and female standard levels must apply.

You're looking at a standard for a population and then for individual exceptions and if those exceptions fit or do not fit into the 2 major categories of Mens or Womens.

I don't know if it's even possible for an alternative to the above categories becuase of the tiny number involved as outliers and equally the audience for that.

They may just be masculine presenting females..... Not all DSD's are genetically male. Someone with DSD may or may not produce testosterone within the male range. For example someone with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome will be born a female with a vagina,live as a female,develop female secondary sex characteristics like breasts and may be completely unaware of this condition until puberty when they don't get a period. They're basically infertile females with a Y chromosome. They produce testosterone sometimes in the male range but that testosterone is useless to their body as their body can't absorb it so they basically just piss it out. The testosterone can't help them as far as any physical advantage in sports because they're body can't use it. They're usually pretty bad at sports unless they train and practice. DSD's are alot of different disorders. Around 30-40 different ways to have a DSD and they're as common as redheads. We don't realize it cause most people don't broadcast their confidential medical information and the vast majority of them live and identify as one gender or the other. Unless you're one of their intimate partners or their physician then you won't know for sure who has a DSD but they're more common than everyone thinks....And also something to think about. If we make having a Y chromosome the disqualifier even though that doesn't necessarily give one an advantage then we still run into problems. There are DSD's who are XX males. Where do they compete? They develop male characteristics,usually have a penis and testicles and live and identify as men. Yet they are XX. Would it be okay for these men to box in the women's division??

When the dust settles, it will be interesting to see who is willing to show some humility. So many armchair ""experts"" are either convinced that ""they are men"", simply because they supposedly have XY chromosomes, or that ""they are biological women"" simply because they were socialized that way (in a conservative Muslim country that makes no accommodation for intersex people!).
Those of us ""in the middle"" are trying to bridge this divide and acknowledge that even if they are intersex, they are human beings too and are not cheating even if they have an advantage over women with XX chromosomes and no androgenic conditions. 
But the fact of the matter is NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE! 
The IBA is not releasing the lab results, perhaps because of confidentiality agreements, or their own corruption. This can't be dismissed, certainly not after watching the IBA press conference today (Monday, Aug. 5th) which was far from confidence inspiring. Furthermore, the IOC doesn't do any kind of chromosomal gender testing, and their track record of foot-dragging and passing-the-buck on this issue is pathetic. The XX women runners at the London, Rio and Tokyo Olympics who lost medals to DSD XY46 runners in the 200m and 800m events have never been acknowledged or compensated even after World Athletics changed their policies in 2023.
So we'll never know.

Ugyc1CF_3kslZPsvEr94AaABAg,ovCeNygomxs,"While the International Boxing Association can't disclose what test was given due to privacy rules, both of these boxers can annouce the results of the tests and end the speculation with fact. The IBA tested twice using different and independent laboratories. Both boxers and the IOC received the results. Or they can retake the test using an independent laboratory and announce the result.

Imane Khelif has been participating in the IBA competitions since 2018, and Lin Yu-ting has competed since 2017. Current IBA management, having been in leadership since December 2020, has been on top of the problem from the very first IBA Women’s World Boxing Championships they conducted in 2022. IBA cannot comment on the previous iterations and lack of leadership actions in this regard.

Following many complaints from several coaches, boxers agreed to gender testing. Blood sample collection was made on 17 May 2022. Sistem Tip Laboratory from Istanbul (License Number: 194-MRK) issued its report on 24 May 2022, after the competition ended. The laboratory detected results that didn’t match the eligibility criteria for IBA women’s events.

Khelif won the silver medal in category 63 kg, Lin won the gold medal in category 57 kg.

One test for each athlete was not enough to make a decision with respective consequences; in the case that one test mistake is possible. The lawyers advised to monitor the situation and to contact the IOC.

IBA informed the IOC representatives about these tests, but no reaction followed from the IOC side.

The situation was completely new to boxing, and IBA, following numerous consultations, decided to conduct a second testing before disqualifying the boxers. However, the second testing could only be conducted in a neutral country and within the IBA competition period.

At the next IBA Women’s World Boxing Championships 2023 in New Delhi, Khelif and Lin were tested following their consent again before their first fights. Blood sample collection was made on 17 March 2023. Dr Lal PathLabs from New Delhi issued its report on 23 March 2023. The findings were absolutely identical to the first test results.

On 24 March 2023, IBA Secretary General & CEO at the time, George Yerolimpos, informed both Khelif and Lin about their exclusion from the Championships for not meeting the eligibility criteria. The athletes received a copy of their testing and were informed about the possibility of appealing to the CAS within 21 days.

Khelif and Lin were informed accordingly about the decision and acknowledged it by signing the papers. The test details were attached to the letter.

On 26 March 2023, the IBA Board of Directors by a majority vote decided to ratify the decision taken by the IBA Secretary General & CEO on behalf of IBA to disqualify Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting from the IBA Women’s World Boxing Championships 2023.

These tests affect the private life of the person concerned and constitute medical information protected as personal data. We are not allowed to publish these documents without the agreement of the person concerned. However, both Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting received a copy of these tests, and they never disputed it. They know these tests exist and it is not fake.

Both athletes were provided with the right to appeal against the Board’s decision to the CAS.

Lin Yu-ting did not appeal against the decision to declare her ineligible, and it became legal and binding.

On 12 May 2023, IBA amended its Technical and Competition Rules. After internal discussion, it was decided by the Board of Directors that IBA competitions will be conducted only between male athletes and between female athletes. Participation of DSD athletes (“differences of sexual development”) in boxing competitions were found dangerous for health and security of the boxers.

Amendments made by the Board to the T&C Rules:

Definition of Men/Male/Boy = individual with chromosome XY.

Definition of Women/Female/Girl = individual with chromosome XX

Rule 4.2. Eligibility on Gender:

4.2.1.Boxers will compete against boxers of the same gender, meaning Women vs Women and Men vs Men as per the definitions of these Rules.

4.2.2.To determine the gender, the Boxers can be submitted to a random and/or targeted gender test which will be conducted by IBA in cooperation with the selected laboratory personnel.

4.2.3. In case of adverse result, the Boxer will be immediately notified by IBA.

4.2.4. In case of adverse result, the Boxer will be disqualified from such competition with immediate effect and will be prevented from competing in further IBA-owned and sanctioned competitions of that gender. For this purpose, IBA will share such information with the relevant internal bodies respecting its confidentiality.

On 14 April 2023, Imane Khelif appealed to the CAS against IBA challenging the decision to disqualify her from the competitions. IBA paid its share of procedural costs, which demonstrates the good faith of IBA. Not many international federations agree to pay their share of costs in CAS proceedings. On 27 July 2023, the CAS issued the termination order and terminated the proceedings because the appellant did not pay the costs of the proceedings.

After the termination of the proceedings before the CAS, IBA and Imane Khelif were in contact to resolve the situation. In particular, the athlete provided to IBA number of medical documents, which were examined by the IBA Medical Committee.

On 23 March 2024, the IBA Medical Committee issued its report about the eligibility of Khelif.

On 12 April 2024, IBA informed Imane Khelif about the conclusions made by the IBA Medical Committee and confirmed again that she is not eligible to participate in the IBA Women’s Competition. Therefore, her profile in Elite Women Light Welter was removed from the IBA database. She did not appeal against this decision of IBA.

IBA does not want to comment private life of a person. For IBA it is not a matter how Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting identify themself, and what is written in their passport. IBA’s main concern is that their hormonal imbalance affords them a distinct advantage over their female counterparts within their respective weight categories. It can be dangerous for other female boxers that we have already seen during the Olympic Games. Therefore, she is not eligible to participate in the IBA competitions.

On 5 June 2023, IBA sent an official correspondence to the IOC regarding the case.

On 16 June 2023, the IOC Sports Director Mr Kit McConnell sent the acknowledgment email.

On 31 July 2024, Italian Boxing Federation office sent an email inquiry to the IBA Sport Department asking about the facts that led to Khelif’s disqualification on the eve of the bout against their boxer Angela Carini at the Paris 2024 Games.

IBA issued the first statement about the Khelif/Lin cases following multiple media requests on 31 July 2024.

On 1 August 2024, Carini abandoned the fight at 66kg against Khelif at the Paris 2024 Games after 46 seconds.

IBA condemned the IOC’s eligibility rules that allowed disqualified boxers to participate in the Games following that the IOC was warned about their ineligibility.

IOC claimed at the press briefing that the organization has never been informed about the case, which was a lie.

IBA was forced to give a press conference on 5 August 2024 in Paris to address the situation in detail.

IBA issued a statement with a list of facts and attached documents following the press conference to conclude the case.",@acerrubrum5749,,2,2024-08-06 03:07:25
UgxWcyx6aGMdv3coBcF4AaABAg,ovCeNygomxs,"There are a few other factors that go into looking at DSD from the perspective of maintaining parity in women's sports.

First, there is the notion of parity itself.  We divide women from men for the reasons you outline.  However, among women, as among all humans, there is a wide range of physiognomy.  I'm mindful that it wasn't very long ago that many derisively referred to Serena Williams as ""a man"", or worse. 

There are other factors that impact parity.  For example, in most sports that have widespread participation in youth leagues, individuals born in the first calendar quarter of the fiscal year of the youth version of their sport are disproportionately represented among the D1 and pro levels.  At younger ages, these individuals can be up to 11 months older than their teammates and competitors, which can make a huge difference in ability.  That translates to more playing minutes, more competitive successes, more coaching attention and positive feedback.  These intangible advantages persist as athletes age and the physical advantage shrinks.

Second, keep in mind we're talking only about high level athletes here.  For most mortals, sports are enjoyed in intramural or informal settings.  The dormitory coed ultimate Frisbee team.  The after-work ""beer league"" softball team.  Some may be a top finisher in their local 10k charity run or fund raising golf scramble, but none of these athletes are even within spitting distance of pros.  Making to the top levels (D1 scholarships, pro berths) requires a few things to occur in concert.  First, the individual must be born with physical attributes that lend themselves to a sport.  Simone Biles is 4'8"" and weighs about 100 lbs.  Ilona Maher is 5'10' and weights 200 lbs.  Kamilla Cardoso is 6'8"" and weights 215 lbs.  All three are (to my knowledge) genotypical.  In each case, the physiognomy is helpful in her chosen sport.  Each is a top performer at the highest level in her sport, but none could compete in the other's sport.  Second, the individual must have such passion for the sport that, from the youngest age, it is virtually the only thing she can think about and wants to do, pretty much all the time, to obsession.  Third, this unique individual with the ideal physique and the love of the sport must enjoy life circumstances as a youth that afford her the ability to participate in organized versions of her sport at a high level, with good coaching, etc.  Fourth, the individual must be able to push her body to its limits over and over and over, for a decade or more, without sustaining any injury that retards performance to a level where high level competition is no longer feasible.  

In other words, the odds are low.  The number of players on the WTA, the WNBA, the NWSL, or Olympic gymnastics, etc., in each case comprise functionally zero percent of the population.

Nobody is certain how many DSD births occur as a function of population.  Estimates range from around 0.5% to 1.0%.  These individuals experience stigma and rejection at higher levels, meaning fewer of them will have the wherewithal to pursue a sport with a passion.  The fact that in this discussion here today we can only name two or three such individuals, in various sports, is a testament to this.   

That has to be taken into account.  Even within non-DSD individuals, genetic odds tell us that occasionally there will be individual genotypical women with physiognomies that are virtually perfect for a specific sport.  Such as Simone Biles, with her compact 4'8"" height coupled with a strong, sturdy build.  Or Sydney McGlaughlin-Levrone, whose height and stride is almost the perfect measure for the space between hurdles.  Serena Williams, whose body had the almost perfect combination of size and strength packaged into a compact and mobile frame.  Athing Mu and the 800 m.

I point this out because one of the reasons supporters of women's sports are so concerned about trans athletes is the potential for floodgates to open, with top level women's sports becoming saturated with genetic males.  Where money and fame are at stake, there is little that some people won't do.  Can anybody say Lance Armstrong?

There is no floodgate issue with DSD individuals.  There are simply too few of them, almost none competing in sports at a high level.

Further, though their testosterone levels are equivalent to that of males, my understanding is that the few DSD athletes we know of today are not overwhelmingly dominant in their sport(s).  Caster Semenya is beaten all the time by some of the other top runners in her distance.  Her PB in the 800 is a non-ratified 1:54:25.  Athing Mu's PB (ratified at a sanctioned event) is 1:54:97.  Virtually identical times.  Top male runners routinely clock in around 1:43 - 1:45.  Semenya's PB in the 200 is 23.49.  Gabby Thomas just won the Olympic gold with a time of 21.82.  Semenya would not have made it past the semis with her time.  By the way, the WR in this event, 21.34, is held by FloJo, whom many believe to have been using performance enhancing drugs. So there's that. Top male runners routinely finish this distance well south of 20 seconds.  In other words, the data suggests that DSD athletes perform like a strong/fast female, as opposed to the overwhelming male dominance displayed in the mixed relay clip you show in the video.


Then, there is the issue of testing.  Most girls nowadays start sports around age 4 or 5.  At that point, most families don't know their daughter is a geno-diverse individual.  As the poster notes, these girls compete for years as girls.  If genetic testing were the litmus, it should be done at age 4, when they start, so that ""girls"" who should be competing with boys can be steered in that direction.  Putting aside the collective cost of genetically testing millions of little girls (including in nations like Algeria, Ecuador, or Sri Lanka), most of whom will stop competing in organized sports by about age 12 or so, imagine the logistics.  Most youth sports organizations are low-budget operations run by parent volunteers who barely have time to get the kids to the pitch on Saturday, never mind manage sensitive medical data for dozens or hundreds of little girls in compliance with HIPPA.  These databases will be stored on some tired parent's computer, at home, probably unprotected.  The one thing we know about databases is that they tend to be compromised, hacked, and stolen.

Which industry, out of all industries in the world, stands to profit by knowing the genetic data about millions of little girls?  Let me give a clue:  it's a 9-letter word beginning with ""i"" and ending with ""insurance"".  Genetic testing nowadays routinely unearths a ton of data:  proclivity for cancer or heart disease, snoring/sleep apnea, lactose tolerance, etc.  In the long run, insurers are the only group that will benefit from this.  The occasional mediocre welterweight woman boxer from an underfunded national program won't benefit in the long run by postponing her inevitable loss well before the medal stage for one additional round.  Is it really worth the almost immeasurably small statistical increase in competitive parity to invest the resources to amass this database that will benefit what is one of the most despised industry sectors humans have created? In real life, almost no higher level woman athlete in any sport will face a head-to-head competition with a DSD athlete.  

These athletes have not, to my knowledge, performed anywhere close to the level needed to compete in men's sports.  Thus, banning them from women's sports effectively means that the tiny number of DSD individuals who eventually excel in any sport would never have an opportunity to compete anywhere.

Keep in mind that one of the reasons this discussion is taking place is because the ""woke"" left has been militating for rules allowing trans males to compete as females.  To accommodate this, sporting bodies have adopted testosterone threshold tests. The paradox is that these tests allow men to compete as women by temporarily suppressing their testosterone with hormone-suppressing drugs, while at the same time creating a bar that prevents a DSD individual from competing even where that individual was identified as a girl at birth and who was raised as a girl.",@TheZipeedoo,,0,2024-08-06 02:44:05

Strange how the disorders that confer the advantages of male puberty to an athlete are always treated with more deference than the safety and fairplay to unambiguous women athletes.
It is NOT womens responsibility to make nice, share, empathize, and accommodate the Y chomazone to the detriment of their own safety, medals, scholarships, sponsorships, money, professional development, and job opportunities.
Mammalian sex is determined genetically by the presence of X and Y chromosomes. Individuals homozygous for X (XX) are female, while heterozygous individuals (XY) are male. The presence of a Y chromosome causes the development of male characteristics, while its absence results in female characteristics. The XY system is also found in some insects and plants.
It would be simple to have and announce the genetic test. Either in this case they are a great female boxer or they are in the wrong category.
End the discussion, arguments, and speculation. 
While I sympathize and empathize for all people with a difficult medical diagnosis, sometimes life is very hard and I wish them well.
Perhaps, athletes with complicated disorders should be in the Paralympic Games or have TransFemale & surprise chomazone tests and TransMale & surprise chomazones test categories.

""In mammals in general,"" says U professor David Carrier of the School of Biological Sciences, ""the difference between males and females is often greatest in the structures that are used as weapons.""
The researchers rigged up a hand crank that would mimic the motions of a punch.

They also measured participants' strength in pulling a line forward over their head, akin to the motion of throwing a spear.
This tested an alternative hypothesis that males' upper body strength may have developed for the purpose of throwing or spear hunting.

Twenty men and 19 women participated. ""We had them fill out an activity questionnaire,"" Morris says, ""and they had to score in the 'active' range. So, we weren't getting couch potatoes, we were getting people that were very fit and active.""

But even with roughly uniform levels of fitness, the males' average power during a punching motion was 162% greater than females', with the least-powerful man still stronger than the most powerful woman.",@acerrubrum5749,,29,2024-08-06 07:44:39

The two ranges are so different that you might want to call the categories high t and low t, and sex would have a superstrong correlation but not exact identification with that. 
In my view, gender dysphoric people should be allowed to have hormones when they're old enough to understand themselves better, meaning a trans woman _couldn't_ typically participate with bio women; but not _per se_ , only through testosterone levels measurements.",@nefaristo,,4,2024-08-06 10:34:19

Then it is not about DSDs or trans, we should only test for T. What about CIAS - since their bodies cannot process the T even if they have high T it is not an advantage, and btw, there are women who look like women and still have those conditions? What about biological women with higher T, but with their ovaries, uterus, and even period - can they compete? So for a woman to compete she should have all kinds of genetic tests throughout age 10 to 25? I see a lot of different comments, I see u do not come from a place of hate, which I respect, yet I'm really asking here. I did a deep dive, such controversies have been around since at least 1936 (earliest case I found), there was, for a period of time, literal genitalia tests. My first question was in relation to Maria Jose Martinez-Patiño who has very interesting story. What about people who have conditions leading to increase in HGH production? I got lost at some point. So about Imane Khelif there are no official medical tests for us to actually know what she has or not.

But the reality and truth is they are biological men and they have no business competing again girls and women. Period. It's insane we even need to have this conversation. Normal rational people understand this. It's science. 

The only reason it's an issue is the western world is being taken over by Marxist elites hell bent on destroying capitalism and democracy with oppressor/oppressed narratives and identity politics. The irony is this is Paris, the birthplace of Post Modernism which spawned critical theory which states there is no objective reality. The post-modernists were atheist Marxists philosophers. 

Every Communist revolution uses identity politics and oppressor/oppressed narratives to brainwash people especially those most easily manipulated via emotions, empathy, and virtue, which is evil. We had the Cold War and a century of global war because self righteous virtuous Russian and German Jews from the Manhattan Project thought the world would be a better place if America and Russia had the bomb. Fifty years of global destruction and chaos and over 100 million dead due to Communism was the product of their virtue.

Her bronze medal was lost because her floor routine went over the allotted, objective, 1 minute time limit. 
Trying to use race as a reason for her medal being stripped is as authentic as her nails. She thinks because she's not white she doesn't have to follow the same rules as everyone else, and when she breaks those rules all the white people are supposed to just look the other way  since they have now been assured she'll decree them all racist for pointing out a clear rule violation.

Ugy2F6aA6eum_xknUex4AaABAg,nNOjtZYhSJ0,"This is for people calling out Paris and the 'French', and calling this the worst olympics ever

1. Yes it cost a lot to clean it but you have to remember this isn't just cleaning it but installing new comportments and ensuring the Seine will remain clean even after the olympics. It is a huge projet so of course it's going to be expensive whether worth it or not. Also all news of the swimmers being sick afterwards are fake. As of right now no swimmer has become sick and for those saying some people threw up after the race that is completely normal and often occurs after such a ruling race, also bacterial infection don't show up after an hour of contamination. This point is useless and baseless and is just an excuse to bash the olympics
2. Yes, a pretty bad mistake, however seen as everyone in the comments seem to blame France for these controversies, the only defence I will give here is that this is a mistake of the Olympic Committee and has nothing to do with Paris or France. Remember, Paris is just hosting the venues and providing security, the rest such as this is the IOC
3. Again, this is the Olympic committee not Paris
4. I do, for the most part, agree with this point, and this was done by France, however, this did not 'offend' everyone as the Paris opening had a very big approval rate in most countries. Disappointing nonetheless.
5. This is hypocrisy at its finest. The cardboard beds came are the exact same as those from Tokyo, yet when it happened there the athletes and people praised them, for the most part, yet when it happens in Paris it receives rife criticism, I believe this is simply as people like to critique France and praise Japan but I may be wrong. For the AC, I agree Paris should accommodate athletes with it but don't at like there is 'extreme heat', because there isn't and the village is made to be as cool as possible. Also the lack of AC is for the environment. 
6. Nothing to do with Paris or France here and anyways, they got punished for there actions.
7. Again, not Paris or France who chose to do this, just a mistake of a few people. Also this such a minor issue that it being the seventh biggest controversy shows the Paris Olympics isn't as bad as everyone says it is.
8. Wow, it rained, such a controversy. The first few points had some elements behind them but now it's getting ridiculous. 
9. Won't get into politics here, but this was once again a decision from the IOC not Paris.
10. This is a french law. You cannot under any circumstance display your religion in public and the hijab does just that so of course it is banned. Moreover, this has little to do with the olympics, this is purely French politics. Also, it is important to note this is only valid to French athletes not others and so if anything the French committee was actually pretty lenient as it could have asked to ban those aswell.

Let's not forget the great things about these olympics from Paris such as the security (so far), the venues with amazing views, the gender equality (although this was IOS not Paris), the atmosphere, the stadiums, the environmental measures and these are just of the top of my head.

Romans 3:23

2. THE PENALTY OF SIN.

Romans 6:23
For the wages of sin is death.

3. THE GOODNESS OF GOD.
(God paid for your sins through Jesus)
Romans 5:8
But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

Romans 6:23
For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

4. THE WAY IS JESUS.
(Jesus is the only way and Savior)
Romans 10:9
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

‌Confess to God that you are a sinner.

	3. France should have had the largest empire in history.

Look what's happened.. Why? In turn a descent into antiGod things.

France,   turned her back on God and committed sacrilege, including committing crimes  beheading anyone the citizen police deemed unworthy. 

 ...so the  lingua franca was turned over to that  inferior tongue, that thus became the language of everything and built  the largest Empire in history, yes, France bequeathed all this, to that diminutive nation sitting across that saving sleeve of water.

The Olympics should have showpieced France's greatness,(inventing everything from photography to smokeless gunpowder and rifling,  and much much more)
Instead  Paris was ruined by mockery of the most important and sacred supper in history and so showed worldwide our descent into  depravity.

In Revelation 2:13, Pergamum is identified as the place ""where Satan’s throne is,""  referring to the Great Altar of Zeus. This same altar was later moved to Germany, influencing the Nuremberg stadium used by the Nazis—a regime responsible for the deaths of millions decimating 6 million Poles and Jews.

The athletes often competed naked in honor of Zeus and engaged in sexual immorality with temple prostitutes as part of their participation in these pagan rituals. These practices were not just idolatrous but were direct acts of worship to Satan, disguised as the god Zeus.

Given these origins and the explicit connection to Satan, Christians MUST boycott the Olympic Games from now on! Idolatry and immorality that still linger from these ancient practices.

In all this, supreme homage was paid to Satan; while Christ, in His characteristics of truth, purity, and unselfish love, was crucified.

The organizers knew what they were doing and went for  an angenda base presentation.  There is a time and place for political and cultural agendas, and the Olympics is not the place or time to make bais base statements. The reality is that some parts of the world are not tolerant of trans and gays, which will inevitably offend some.   France had an opportunity to show the world its rich history, culture, and heritage, just like the previews host countries. Nothing political, only SPORTS, which it should only be about, that is why it's called the Olympics, not a drag show.  Whoever was in charge did not take anything into consideration or thought. Their own personal agenda, beliefs, ego, and narcissism were obviously the  only thing they had in mind, and the result was the worst Olympic opening ceremony. I hope they are proud of themselves cause they've achieved nothing.

UgxICviDUKMKwxJHbRJ4AaABAg,vzRXlb_AEnA,"Beware of Paris syndrome 

Olympic 2024 opening ceremony in Paris was eccentric and extraordinary. French have a reputation for being unpredictable and unapologetic. But even the most francophone of people are now criticizing the scandalous spectacle on the river Seine. 

They showcased a bizarre parody on the last supper. A grotesque reenactment of Marie  Antoinette's beheading. 
Lots of nudity. Lots of subversive hedonistic symbolism linked to LGBT propaganda ( which have nothing to do with athletics or French culture) were bombarded to billions of audience. Flabbergasting! 

Lots of technical glitches too: referring to South Korean athletes as representatives of Democratic People's Republic of Korea - not very flattering. 

Dancers on stage slipped and fell off the stage as Lady Gaga performed in soaking rainfall. 
Snoop Dogg leads the torch rally ( yes out of 8 billion Sapiens they choose that weed sniffing idiot for the honour. Voila ! )

The weather isn't helping either.
The relentless rainfall has dampened the whole festive atmosphere.
French are never known to be friendly to tourists, but now even the weather is unfriendly. 

Rules of Olympics were broken by hosting the ceremony on Seine river instead of stadium. Alas ... The idea has  badly backfired. 
Many swimming events like Triathlon were cancelled because of dead rats and raw sewage seen floating. Apparently the Seine is as clean as French conscience. 

Epstein lifestyle of sin and shame is being promoted. Catholic Christian family values are being desecrated. Jesus Christ martyred two thousand years ago to save us from damnation. How dare these organizers mock the Redeemer? 
Can they also dare to mock at Islam ? 
Reminiscent of Charle Hebdo magazine's caricature of Prophet Muhammad and the subsequent terrorist attacks ? 
Mindless materialism and shameless voyeurism has infected western media. 
Morality is the foundation of any civilization.
If morality is destroyed, European Union will collapse just like the Roman empire. 
No wonder right wing neo Nazi political parties are gaining popularity all across Europe. Europeans are feeling like foreigners in their own land. Disillusioned and demoralised  by  alien, anti - Christian policies enforced upon them. 

Nevertheless the snobs remain unapologetic and unembarrassed.

UgzLDx-cfKz5wndQ7wV4AaABAg,vzRXlb_AEnA,"Article 50 of the Olympic Charter: Prohibition of Demonstration or Propaganda

According to Article 50 of the Olympic Charter, any demonstration or propaganda, political, religious, or racial, is prohibited in any Olympic site, venue, or other areas. This rule aims to maintain the neutrality of the Olympic Games, ensuring that athletes and participants focus on sports performance rather than political or ideological agendas.

Key Points:

Prohibition of demonstration or propaganda: Article 50 explicitly bans any form of demonstration or propaganda, including political, religious, or racial, in Olympic sites, venues, or other areas.
Neutrality of the Olympic Games: The rule is designed to maintain the Olympic Games’ neutrality, allowing athletes to compete without being influenced by external political or ideological factors.
Scope: The prohibition applies to all Olympic sites, venues, and areas, including those used for training, competition, and ceremonies.
Context and Rationale:

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has emphasized the importance of maintaining the Olympic Games’ neutrality, citing the Olympic Truce and the principle of Olympism. The IOC aims to create a platform where athletes can come together, set aside their differences, and focus on sportsmanship and athletic achievement.

Implications:

Article 50 has implications for athletes, teams, and National Olympic Committees (NOCs). It means that:

Athletes must refrain from making political statements or engaging in political activities during the Olympic Games.
Teams and NOCs must ensure that their athletes comply with Article 50.
The IOC will enforce disciplinary measures for breaches of Article 50, including sanctions for athletes and teams.
Conclusion:

Article 50 of the Olympic Charter is a crucial rule in maintaining the neutrality and integrity of the Olympic Games. It ensures that athletes can compete on a level playing field, free from external influences, and focus on their sports performance.",@michaeljames8408,,0,2024-08-03 23:07:04

In this work, we see the Olympian gods celebrating the wedding of Peleus and Thetis a. At the center of the table is Apollo, while Dionysus does what he knows best: drinks, eats, and celebrates, even if he is not blue, like the one in the opening ceremony in Paris. And if Biljert's technique reminds you of something from... da Vinci, perhaps ""confusing"" many, the explanation is quite simple: the Dutch painter spent part of his life in Rome and, like many of his colleagues, was influenced by the art of Caravaggio a (1571-1610).",@edwhug,,2,2024-08-02 23:19:43

No, I don't think mocking the Last Supper, a sacred event in Christianity, was the right thing to do. Here's why:

1. *Disrespect*: It showed disrespect towards a deeply held belief and sacred event for many people.

2. *Inclusion*: The Olympics aim to be inclusive, but this action excluded and alienated those who hold this belief dear.

3. *Sensitivity*: It lacked sensitivity towards religious differences and the impact such actions can have on people.

4. *Unity*: The Olympics aim to unite people, but this action only served to divide.

5. *Respect for diversity*: It's essential to respect and appreciate diversity, including religious beliefs, to create a harmonious and inclusive environment.

Ugyx7rQOpFlfIFmCY794AaABAg,vzRXlb_AEnA,"First of all, France called South Korea as North Korea.  Then, they called North Korea as North Korea.  Even they did not show South Korean flag in the boat.  It was very intentional because South Korean companies defeat the France Companies for both military and nuclear productions in order to have win a contract in other countries. 

France hung the Olympic flag upside down. 

The river was extremely contaminated by germs. But they put the swimmers in that river. 

France put paper box bed that was  also made in Red China. So many atlas cannot comfort sleep. It also made their condition bad. 

France made only vegetable meals for all athletes. So they cannot have a good condition for their games. 

France did not put air conditioner in all athletes and shuttle buses. 

All of products selling in the gift shop is ‘Made in China.’ Only good for Red China. 

France showed so many rubber, stealing, and pick pocket toward both athletes and tours. 

France raised up room charge and food expense as double.

UgwcB5XyPhmyFACSssB4AaABAg,vzRXlb_AEnA,"I've watched the whole of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony and honestly have to say the following. Paris is a great city with old refined culture. So many good things were there at the opening, not only something disgusting. Let’s be honest. I can imagine how much work was done for the Opening ceremony; so many people worked hard to make the ceremony as good as possible. First, what I liked is: 
1. Beautifully decorated Paris. “This is your city for the next 16 days!”, all the athletes and spectators are welcome.
2. The boats sailing on the Seine with cheerful athletes. 
3. A rock band playing on the walls and the opera lady singer.
4. The mysterious guy running with the torch with his face covered. 
5. The cartoon with minions doing some sports on a submarine, it was hilarious.
6. A gorgeous black woman singing La Marseillaise on the top of the building.
7. The idea to praise great women in the French history. 
8. The episode with a dancer/singer wearing a white costume, the baroque style singing and music. 
9. Multiple acrobats performing on green colour platforms on the Seine. 
10. The disabled people performing at the catwalk, really representing “inclusivity”.
11. The silver horse ride on the Seine. It generates many ideas and allegories.
12. The black and white footage of 1924 Paris Olympics.
13. The athletes with flags of their countries near the Eifel Tower and then the serene ride of a warrior on a white horse.
14. The raft with bonfire calling for peace on the planet.
15. The anthem of the Olympics sung in the rain.
16. The Refugee Olympic Team episode.
What I didn’t like:
1. “Bloody” performance with lots of blood-like red liquid pouring down on viewers; beheaded people in the windows. Yes, it’s part of the French history, but what’s the need to show beheaded monarchs in this context? Everyone knows they were beheaded. Almost all countries had some bloody episodes in their history. Should it be brought out at the Olympics? 
2. The figures of the great women of France emerging from some grey boxes - it looked very cheap. The organisers of the show could have shown the photos or portraits of those great women on a large display, which would have looked much better, in my opinion. Again, the idea is noble and deserves respect. Women should never be underestimated! I always stand for women’s rights. Nevertheless, what about the great men of France? They were kind of discriminated in the ceremony. For a balance, at least a couple of great men could be mentioned, too. :) 
3. “Threesome” story in a library and then those three running together to a room to make love. It looked imposing and out of place. Is there really a need to bring this out or promote? Those who want threesome will do it anyway. :) 
4. Why did one of the balls rolled out of the pants of one of the male dancers dressed in black and remained like that during that part where the “blue” guy played the role of Dionysus? That’s a mystery. Like ancient Greek mysteries of god Dionysus, too. :) Nothing scary, but it should have been blurred at least. The ball was very visible. 
5. They overdid it a bit with LGBT and trans thing at the catwalk show and a few videos. No, I’m not a homophobe. :) 
6. There should have been more focus on sports and athletes. It’s the Olympics, after all.  

Regarding the notorious mock of the Last Supper. Well, after seeing the show more attentively, I can say that it’s disputable. I counted 16 people on both sides of that full-sized woman wearing a strange-looking russian-like hat. Around Jesus there were 12 apostles, not 16, right? So, was it really a parody of the Last Supper? Should any group of 13 or more people standing at a table be always considered as a mock of the Last Supper? Apart from that, even Leonardo showed some inaccuracy in his painting as it’s said in the Bible that Jesus and the apostles were half-reclining while taking food at the Last Supper (see the texts of the Gospels of the Bible). It was traditional in Rome and other lands in those times to recline while dining. Jesus and the apostles were not standing at the table. And even if that chubby woman at the opening ceremony represented Jesus, perhaps for a mock it would have been better (from the mockers’ view) to place there a bearded trans? Next, when it comes to the Greek god of wine and pleasure Dionysus, played by a chap painted in blue, which was also extensively criticized, I guess in Ancient Greece they had much weirder performances. You would be shocked to see that now, some 27 centuries after the first games in Olympia, Greece. Or should we then forget where the Olympic Games started? Then you’d have to change the name “Olympics” to something else. Perhaps “Holy Runs”. No, I’m not against Christianity or any other religion until it becomes violent and imposing. Personally I didn’t like the whole of the catwalk show, including that blue guy playing Dionysus, it looked cheap and vulgar to me, with all that artificial fruit arrangement as his bed. But in my opinion there was nothing terribly bad in the opening ceremony, except for some parts. The overall message for peace and against any hatred was quite appropriate. And the show in general was impressive and matching the Parisienne style. Definitely, dictators sending their troops to kill people in neighbouring countries are incomparably (IMCOMPARABLY!) worse than just some flaws in shows at opening ceremonies. It’s great to see people from more than 200 countries competing with each other in a peaceful way, according to rules, not attacking and killing each other. Thank you France!

I loved the whole ceremony and even more this freedom that some consider a lack of respect. For those who believe in God, you have to remove the sausage skins that you have in front of your eyes before criticizing. Religions only bring hatred, violence and intolerance. Believe in what you want at home but leave others alone. If God had to exist, we would have known about it a long time ago. God is an entity created by man for man, a mirage, smoke and mirrors.

Moi je me moque de Jésus, de Dieu, et de tout ce qui peut représenter une religion. Du bourrage de crâne pour des personnes qui croient au Père-Noël. J'ai adoré toute la cérémonie et encore plus cette liberté que certains considèrent comme un manque de respect. Pour ceux qui croient en Dieu, il faut enlever les peaux de saucisson que vous avez devant les yeux avant de critiquer. Les religions n'apportent que haine, violence et intolérance. Croyez à ce que vous voulez chez vous mais laissez les autres tranquilles. Si Dieu devait exister ça se saurait depuis bien longtemps.

UgyDDDhkmVjOMZ8yS2p4AaABAg,UgyDDDhkmVjOMZ8yS2p4AaABAg,"You’re an idiot. Here’s the quote “The name of this sequence was ‘La Cène sur la scène sur la Seine’ - which for those who don't speak French, translates as 'The Last Supper on the stage on the River Seine'. The pun being that Cène, Scene and Seine all sound the same in French.   So we know it's not Bacchanalia, otherwise it would have been called ""Bacchanalia on the River Seine"". Instead, we know this is a portrayal of the last supper, because the title of the segment tells us so. 

Also, the artistic director behind the scene, Thomas Jolly, said in the daily press conference following the opening ceremony, when asked specifically whether he had any views on why Christians might be offended by that segment, that he wanted to convey that in France ""we have a right to not be worshippers"". He did not say ""you're mistaken, because it wasn't the last supper"", rather, he explained why it was chosen and what it was trying to portray. 

Yes, the man in blue was Dionysus/Bacchus, but the point of the scene was to insert Dionysus into the last supper. Why? Dionysus was the god of wine. The last supper is the moment where Christ (who in Christian theology is God) gives wine and bread to his disciples, asking them to continue this practice in memory of him, as it represents the sacrifice he would make on the cross the next day. In ‘La Cène sur la scène sur la Seine', what they did was swap out Jesus (as the Christian God who gives out wine as a symbol of sacrifice for salvation) with Dionysus (as the pagan God who gives out wine as a symbol of hedonistic pleasure).

It wasn't enough that they just depict Dionysus. They COULD have just depicted Dionysus in Bacchanalia and nobody would have cared. But the whole point of ‘La Cène sur la scène sur la Seine' was to depict a Pagan God in the place of the Christian God, in one of the most sombre and sacred moments of the Bible.

Final note, in the last 24 hours, Olympics Opening Ceremonies producers have releases a statement which confirms that (and this is a direct quote from said statement): ""Thomas Jolly took inspiration from Leonardo da Vinci’s famous painting to create the setting"".

Given that the producers admit that it was the last super, the artistic director agrees that he was trying to turn it into a pagan festival as a demonstration of the right to not worship, and the title of the scene is literally ""the last supper on the stage of the Seine"", I think we can put to rest this argument floating around on social media that the entire thing was Bacchanalia. It wasn't. It was Dionysus portrayed in the place of Jesus in the last supper, and now that the Olympics have apologised for that, maybe we can stop pretending that Christians are imagining things or taking offence unjustly.”",@slipperyseal95,,0,2024-08-26 21:06:44

The party you think is a parody of the Last Supper is actually a Greek bacchanal—a lavish, noisy festival that lasted several days, held in ancient Greece to celebrate events like the Olympics.

And the blue figure isn’t a parody of Jesus Christ; it’s Dionysus, the Greek god of fertility, wine, and pleasure. Also, the Olympics celebrated physical prowess and divine favor, concepts linked to the symbolic power of the bull in Greek culture.

As for some of the mentioned topics in the video:
1- Secularism is a very important part of French History and society. It may be considered strict seen from outside but it based on centuries of fights to reduce the influence of religions over society.
2- “The last supper” as you call is actually “The feast of the gods” representing an Olympian banquet with Dionysus at the center mixed with a Parisian style catwalk and dance party. The blue guy in the center is Philippe Katerine, a French actor/singer who does a lot of self-derision. Maybe too French for an international audience ahah. 
The only reason why people said it was scandalous is because it was portrayed with drag queens. But drag queens have been part of the Parisian life for quite a while (first drag cabaret being opened in 1948) and they are just performers like any other artists. Had it been done with other people nobody would have cared.
3- 1.4B€ have been spent on cleaning the Seine river not just for the Olympics but for the years to come as a legacy of the Olympics. Also don’t forget that the Rio waters for triathlon were even more polluted and a lot of athletes got sick after the triathlon back in 2016",@BartDuff19,,0,2024-08-03 12:08:37

Not many today know the real meaning of the ""bloody words"" and the anthems origin, which is a pity. The greater pity is that today the world has to listen to the ramblings of the Petite Napoleon - Monsewer Macron and his pathetic anti-British tirade over the British rights to fishing in the English Channel.  Yes the English Channel and not La Manche as the French would have it. During the period of ancient Roman hegemony the channel was known in Latin as the Oceanus Britannicus and up until around 1549 it was known as the British Sea and it is today Internationally recognised as The English Channel, Monsewer Macron. And don't forget on June 6th 1944 it was the English Channel that was crossed by tens of thousand of British, Canadian and Commonwealth and American troops and not forgetting about a hundred French commandos to liberate France and all of Europe of German tyranny Über alles now that's for another day - Rule Britannia....",@auldflyer,,0,2021-12-18 16:44:37

Will never forget singing La Marseillaise with the rest of the stadium. Goosebumps each time I see the footage now.
Every French face around us belted that anthem out to announce they will never be defeated by the evil that was visited upon them that week in Paris. The emotion had the tears falling down my face as my son looked up at me, piecing it all together.

I have no formal training, but i am well versed in body language and listening to what people give away in their conversations,  and i had heard her overconfidence (conceit?) where she claims to have smashed it, and that she knew she was never going to beat the others. At that point, get your coat and go home, or simply do your best. Eddie the Eagle was a British ski jumper who badly wanted to be world class, and his story is one of sheer determination. Despite coming last he showed absolute commitment to his goal and gave it his All. 
What Gunn has done by way of comparison is akin to getting on the slopes and then as she gets to the end of the ramp, releases a parachute with a silly picture on. She has made the headlines at world level, but not in any way so as to be able to gain respect from anyone with a serious interest in Breakdancing culture.

She just made a mockery of an art form. This is not art by Jackson Pollack, this is I turned up to compete at a world dancing final and didn't even bother to get dressed or follow the accepted (and more importantly, Expected) style, but instead then tries to use some psychological trick to convince people what she did has some actual merit...

UgzNHA7zvjDpjzECWJR4AaABAg,9wXkBGy3W9k,"All your discernments of Rachel Gunn are spot on.

Breakers showcase a combination of power moves, including windmills, the 6-step, and freezes.  The battles are divided into best of three rounds, which are called throwdowns.  

The three elements of breaking are:

•	Top Rock - Dance moves that are performed while the breaker is standing.

•	Down Rock - The part of the breaker's performance that is composed on the floor.

•	Freeze - When the breaker holds a pose in an unusual position during the middle of their performance.

A panel of nine judges score each battle and every round based on five criteria: technique, vocabulary, execution, musicality, and originality.

Therefore, I suspect the AOC anticipated she would score zero or believed the judges might find a way for her to win. Additionally, I think the AOC sent her to advocate for education among young people in underprivileged areas and to promote breakdancing, leveraging her strong writing skills.

Result of the AOC’s decision to send her:

•	She scored 0 from all nine judges in all three categories against her opposing dancer in the first stage and did not advance to the next stage.

•	Someone in Australia that would have scored points was cut from the team.

•	Damaged the worldwide respected reputation of Australia in the Olympics, e.g., swimming, track & field, cycling, rowing, sailing, hockey, equestrian, and surfing.

•	Damaged the reputation of, and trust in, the AOC.

This scandal has been met with too much humor when it should evoke shame, remorse, and apologies. The AOC's support of this woman represents one of the greatest sports scandals of our time. Accountability is necessary within both the AOC and the IOC for this unthinkable injustice against breakdancing, Australia in the Olympics, and the athlete who was cut from the team.",@johnsheakley8836,,2,2024-08-20 21:39:35

And i have an answer for how she eneded up here, they took the first person they saw and didnt ask any questions. I almost think they didnt take it seriously. Like they took the person who won the championship and said yeah lets choose her.

The kangaroo hopping you know with someone with actual skills they could make that look cool with a trick to transition into and out of it. 
The sprinkler, with some skill someone could do that upside down with their legs. 

Honestly at this point you can believe it delusion, but i think i might be sick in the head because i truly believe this woman is somewhere in a corner crying her eyes out of embaressment and the australian commitee, fighting with each other about who let this happen.

The blue sky could fall on us
The earth could collapse
I don't care as long as you love me
I don't care about the whole world
As long as my mornings will be flooded by love
As long as my body will shake under your hands
I don't care about problems
My love, because you love me

I'd tour the whole world, I'd dye my hair blonde 
If you'd ask me to
I'd grab the moon, I'd steal someone's fortune
If you'd ask me to
I'd deny my homeland, I'd deny my friends
If you'd ask me to
They can laugh at me, but I'd do anything 
If you'd ask me to

If life eventually tears you apart from me
If you die and disappear far from me
I don't care as long as you love me
Because I'll die too
We'll have eternity for us
Through the endless blue
In the sky, no more problems
My love, do you think we're in love?

Je me fous du monde entier

Peu m'importe les problèmes

J'irais jusqu'au bout du monde
Je me ferais teindre en blonde
Si tu me le demandais
J'irais décrocher la Lune
J'irais voler la fortune
Si tu me le demandais
Je renierais ma patrie
Je renierais mes amis
Si tu me le demandais
On peut bien rire de moi
Je ferais n'importe quoi
Si tu me le demandais
Si un jour, la vie t'arrache à moi
Si tu meurs, que tu sois loin de moi
Peu m'importe si tu m'aimes
Car moi je mourrais aussi

Dans le ciel, plus de problème

Her documentary serves as an awareness that SPS exists. And with this documentary, people know and more doctors are studying it to find a cure since it’s so rare, they don’t look into too much compared to other illnesses. 
That documentary was made back in 2021-2022 and released on 2024

I would deny my friends

If one day life tears you away from me
If you die, and you are far from me

Tant qu'l'amour innondera mes matins
Tant qu'mon corps frémira sous tes mains
Peu m'importe les problèmes

J'irais jusqu'au bout du monde
Je me ferais teindre en blonde
Si tu me le demandais
J'irais décrocher la Lune
J'irais voler la fortune
Si tu me le demandais
Je renierais ma patrie
Je renierais mes amis
Si tu me le demandais
On peut bien rire de moi
Je ferais n'importe quoi
Si tu me le demandais
Si un jour, la vie t'arrache à moi
Si tu meurs, que tu sois loin de moi
Peu m'importe si tu m'aimes
Car moi je mourrais aussi
Nous aurons pour nous l'éternité

Dans le ciel, plus de problème

You are the only singer I liked as a singer during my years and still am. Your voice is unbelievable, incomparable and unique. Beautiful voice, beautifully mastered highs in any song.Your songs from this album will bring me back to youth and joy, because you are also in my life when it comes to music. Your beautiful duets cannot be overlooked. I'm glad that your album is on YouTube. Your voice also emphasized your appearance as a beautiful woman with a beautiful charisma. I feel like crying when I think you're in pain . Please, Lord God, no, no, no. When I hear those beautiful songs and that beautiful voice, I get chills all over my body. I ask the Lord God to alleviate your pain. Thank you for your beautiful voice in my life and I will never stop listening to your songs. I am a chronic patient, I have about 25 diagnoses and I know what pain is. But I would take your pain from you so that you don't have it. Believe me, I feel terribly with you and it hurts me . Your voice and the beauty of the singer is irreplaceable. Thank you very much and that you have beautified my life with your voice and competence and I think that I am not the only one. Thank you very much.

It wasn't until I was 29 when I googled Celine Dion that I learned that the lady whose voice I admired at the age of 10 was that of Celine Dion!  A now global superstar!!!  I have since seen Celine Dion in Concert and consider myself blessed to have known and appreciated such an incredible singing voice and to have listened to her live at the O2 in London in 2018.  She is my music hero!!!  Celine and Freddie Mercury!  Now this.  Celine will never be silenced no matter her hurdles!  I love her! xxxx",@airsouthwestfan,,3,2024-10-31 20:23:32
