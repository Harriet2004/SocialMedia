Ugw3z-haaNGxwnDgOxN4AaABAg,Qrym1Lk3c1Q,"The Olympics must not exhibit any political or biased tendencies.  The host country, Japan, is also disseminating this information to athletes and officials who participated in the Olympics.  
But Japan, meanwhile, asked the IOC to require that athletes who participated in the Olympics pay a silent tribute to the victims on the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.  
The dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima was not an easy decision made by the United States, the Allied Powers at the time, in that Japan, a war criminal country, did not give up on the war and continued to kill innocent people.  
Remembrance of the victims of the atomic bombing is no different from forcing people to visit Japanese shrines.  
This double aspect of Japan does not qualify as a host country for the Olympics, a place of global harmony, and even after the IOC rejected Japan's request to commemorate the atomic bombing, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Committee said they plans to include a performance that  commemorate the victims of the atomic bombing in this Olympic closing ceremony. This proves that Japan has not yet abandoned its role as a war criminal country rather than an Olympic host country.  
I hope that the people of the world will face this double aspect of Japan and correct their misconceptions about Japan. I also demand the IOC not to tolerate this double act of Japan, the host country of the Olympics, and take corresponding measures.",@mst0452,,0,2021-08-03 00:31:56

this is more like the Mario’s team’s idea.the opening ceremony supposed to have Akira,Mario,Pikachu.the concept was neo Tokyo.

but the team was ruined in the 2020.government made a new team,a team which is more amenable.
And the new team made a new program,for the friends of the government.
They used 16 billion yen on that fuckin ceremony.but nobody believes that,we think 15 billions must be in someone’s pocket.
and now,I’m frist time feeling shame about Japan 😭

And, with cosmic rays and other sources emitting natural or “background” ionizing radiation, it can be difficult to pinpoint whether an acceptable threshold for additional, low-level exposure exists at all.

In terms of athletes and coaches visiting the impacted prefectures for a week or two during the Olympics, Links said the cancer risk is proportional, growing incrementally each day.

The Japanese government has raised what it considers to be the acceptable exposure from 1 millisievert to 20 millisieverts per year. Along with this adjustment, officials have declared much of the region suitable for habitation, lifting evacuation orders in numerous municipalities. Housing subsidies that allowed evacuees to live elsewhere have been discontinued.

Also Japan has the highest percentage of elderly population in the world. I think the US only ranks 16th or something (I'm not sure exactly). But nowhere near Japan.

In addition, all the restrictions in the world and lockdowns have led to more deaths from diseases other than the virus itself. Plus, the mere restriction of freedom and the liquidation of public events in fear of what we already know, is totalitarianism, a form of corpo-communism.

So, to respond to your opinion from the first post: ""blood is on the hands"" of politicians, who in fear of the unknown and bribes from medical corporations, sentenced millions of people to: imprisonment, mental problems, suicide, dying without access to a doctors (because for example with the virus operations can;t be happened), weaker education, acidification of the body by the constant wearing of masks, segregating people into ""vaccinated"" and ""not"" and restricting their freedom like the Nazis, destruction of the medium and lower class of businesses in order to convict them to work in corporations (which will survive the crisis and are associated with the government).

Countries can be kind to Japan and
FORGIVE THE DEBTS that would be incurred by the cancellation If the games due to the pandemic and safety concerns for their own citizens and athletes.

It would be both immoral and inhuman to make the suffer for trying to protect their citizens, and, by extension, other countries citizens by cancelling the games during a RESURGENCE of a viral pandemic.

It would me more just and fair under the current circumstances for companies to absorb the loss, forgive the debt and allow Japan to use those funds to provide health services, products and care to its citizens at this time.

Ugz1smVdSbM5Zps0-1l4AaABAg,ua67tkChkIM,"I invested in Tesla back in  2013, I was very much a bear, My reasoning was simple: Tesla was trying to do what no American automaker has done so far: Develop and sell a mass-market electric vehicle. It was trying to do what no American company had done in nearly a century: Start up a new auto manufacturing business. To take it a step further, I bought 40 shares from Tesla miners, investing about $1,800 in total with part of the proceed  from a 401(k) rollover. At the $908 per share price I sold at,that's a realized profit of $35,000! It may not be a life changing money, but it's an incredible return nonetheless,Now I am working with 3 asset Gold, Silver and Crypto all are good but crypto investment is the mother of them all, Crypto has followed this pattern for sometime now, it dips and gets everyone scared then after retesting an old resistance several times, we wake up one day to see it is bullish. This period is the perfect time to buy the dip and accumulate irrespective of the bulls being under pressure. Bitcoin moving up is inevitable and would see the price of bitcoin surpass it's all time highs. The reversal was imminent because obviously, the bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum  to give the bulls more steam and this just make it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible. I'd strongly advice any newbie/traders to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering whether to enter the market or old time traders who are Holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% trade accuracy. I underwent a series of trading losses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst Expert Mr Brown. My contact with her has being the hallmark of this year for me,under her careful guide and her signal service I've been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.2 btc to 4.6 btc in just 5 weeks. I will advice traders especially newbies to have an orientation of trading before they get involved in it. Expert Mr Brown makes you learn daily while you make profits with her signals.

However, the red rising flag was used for invading countries and even it is not recognized as a Japan's national flag, though still they use their army flag. We are raising the issue that the flag has meaning of imperialism against peace and human rights in the past wartime and try to stop use that flag. So, does Germany use Nazi flag globally? They use their national flag.

>>>>what is the reason to pursue this controversial flag from Japanese side?

There is no Japan side. Rising Sun is one of very popular, common and free designs. It is NOT owned solely by Japan. Its use in public spaces is widely, globally acceptable. Korea's claim infringes free speech. Worse, some psycho Koreans criticize almost everything ""looking like a rising sun."" It is totally out of context. It's not merely Japanese but many others who accuse Korean oppressive behavior and excessive self-victimization with regard to this particular design.

Then I would say you are quite delivering your points that the Japanese goverment stick to. Isn't it obvious? What's the point you mention this thing? lol 


We are raising our voice and telling people ""what you've been using has a really bad meaning for Asian people and please stop using it."" And hey, many Koreans has been doing social activities regarding this so far so you can't say it is prejudice and dimish people's voice to flight the right. And this is the longstanding issue between Korea and Japan, if I would say just focus on the history of my country.


Also, I didn't say IOC should take it back or something, just share what my thought here.


You didn't get the point of this historical issue as well. Alright, like you said, I understand that design is used regardless of the historical meaning around the world. As I said, IT DOESN'T MATTER!  We are telling people what that symbol means to Asian people. BTW, I've never seen this symbol is consumed popularly in abroad as I've been traveling and living in abroad in many years so far lol. Whether it is perceived globally or something is just based on your hypothesis. I know that some brands were criticized to use it, but it doesn't mean that it is so popular.


We were victims in the wartime. What we are saying to correct the wrong is not self-victimization, but letting people know in the world what happened to us and how important it is to say, as a victim!


I've already given you the answer. So does Germany allow to use Nazi symbol in public? No. I am not experts about this so I don't know which countries use their flags and what meaning they have. And this is another topic as well. I am not universally interested in this kind of topic because I don't know all of those histories! However, if people say something has bad meaning, I would stop using it. It is just common sense.


Also, I never say any words that downgrade your points or use insulting languages. However, judging by your comments, your intention is not logically delivering your points but unnecessarily insulting Korean people's fight for rights.


Does your point is that the design is free of historical background, OR many countries still use their flags having colonialization? I say, YES it has historical background that Japan used its flag when they trampled Asian countries. They exploited people and violated human rights, which were unacceptable in modern society. That symbol reminds Asian pacific countries of imperialism that Nazi symbol does of Jews. If you want to use it, use it.

And it's population is around 2 million.
So far, every one of us have never felt the effects of radioactivity.
So we keep living here.
Also, 14 million people live in Tokyo because Tokyo is safe!
Many people (I think most of them is Korean) here seem to compain about radioactivity in Tokyo, but, what do you know about safety in Tokyo? Are you in Tokyo?
If Tokyo were really unsafe because of radioactivity, why are so many people living here and staying healthy?
If you are not in Tokyo and complain about radioactivity, you are ignorant.
I can't understand why so many people recommend other people not to go Tokyo even though many people are living thare healthily. 
And some people here said that Japanese media were lying, but, how did you know that? Is your information really correct? 
Tokyo was chosen to be host for Olympic Games because experts knew that Tokyo was safe!
Many foreigner have already visited Tokyo to see Rugby World Cup so you don't need to worry about it.

To Korean
Pyeongchang was so great!
Then, why do you want to bother next Olympic?
Tokyo is close to your country, so you can enjoy Tokyo Olympic easily as well as Pyeongchang.
I think it's great!
I konw how much you hate Abe, but Olympic is celebration of peace and politics doesn't matter.
If you think that Tokyo is really unsafe and afraid about it, it's okay.

Rather than resolving the problem of radioactive contamination, it seems to be trying to raise awareness that it is lower than the exposure limit by changing standards. Japan currently has virtually no disposal of Fukushima nuclear waste. 97% of the accidentally melted nuclear fuel is still stored inside the nuclear power plant, where radioactive contaminated water is exponentially flowing daily as groundwater seeps into it. Recently, the international environmental group Greenpeace pointed out that Japan plans to keep it in the Pacific. Australian nuclear expert Helen Keldicott said, ""The Japanese government wants to reassure them that the radiation levels are low, but it's all a lie.""",@lucymoon4647,,7,2019-09-02 19:40:50

Japan will deny all this crime when down the road players become sick. 
Japan will say there are not enough evidence of nuclear exposure by Japan's contaminated food, air, and soil.

It interviews experts, community activists and trade unionists about the reality of Fukushima and the massive propaganda campaign to cover-up the continuing dangers and crisis.
PM Abe told the International Olympics Committee that Fukushima had been ""decontaminated"" but there is over 1 million tons of tritium radiocative water in tanks surrounding the broken nuclear reactors, the melted nuclear rods still remain in the reactors and there are tens of thousands of bags of contaminated radioactive material spread throughout the prefecture. The Abe government and it's IOC representatives have also been involved in corruption through bribery of IOC delegates to vote for having the Olympics in Japan.
This documentary hears from people in Japan about the reality of having the 2020 Olympics in Japan and Fukushima.

They said they decided to supply radioactively contaminated food from Fukushima to players and tourists from around the world during the Tokyo Olympics.
Why is it safe to be below the standard, but why should we eat the food with the cesium in it?
Fukushima foods are below the standard, but the detection rate is close to 100%.
In other words, all Fukushima foods have a little cesium in it.

In addition, they still sell Fukushima's original food, just marking it as domestic. The problem is that many tourists do not know and are still eating radioactive contaminated food.
The Fukushima people warn and anger about the Japanese government's lies.

When a tsunami triggered the explosion at the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, the world feared the worst and for good reason. It is the most devastating nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. Tens of thousands of people were forced to leave their homes and millions of others now live in fear of serious illness. Radiation is everywhere - in the soil, trees, food, air and water. The Japanese are trying to clean it up, but they're fighting a losing battle. This Sunday, Liz Hayes goes inside the exclusion zone to the ghost cities, deserted and abandoned, never to be lived in again. And 60 Minutes will also broadcast a warning from one of Australia's leading medical and nuclear experts, who says the 2020 Tokyo Olympics should be cancelled, due to radiation contamination.",@RiskRewardRatioof1to2,,4,2019-07-26 14:05:25

Ask Rio or Pyeongchang how they feel once the olympics are over and that all the venues they've invested by putting themselves into debts for several decades are deserted and nobody uses them any longer!
Even in very powerful or super rich country they're still paying for 16 days of olympics that ended several years ago: in Beijing or London, they had to rise the local tax to make sure they could refund their investors, and they haven't finished yet.
Here in France, they are about to rise the taxes of every frenchmen for Paris 2024n while they said to the CIO that they only needed 6 billions to build the olympic village and an olympic swiming centre: eventually it turned out to be a lie: both of these infrastructures actually cost more than they said, many other existing venues are actually obsolete or too old and needs to be rebuilt or renovated, and several transports thay had planned to link the airports with the venues sites are not even sure to find their investors (And of course thay told the IOC that everything would be on schedule at the right time).
The Olympics are just about throwing billions and billions in an empty basket.
I love the Olympics, it's the greatest world sport competition that has ever been, but to be honest, only super rich country that can throw money away without counting can really afford them (such as the Emiratis for instance) or in my opinion, they should choose one unique city in the world to always host the competition every 4 years: the infrastructures would always be in place, meaning not needing to throw away billions and billions away to build every 4 years in a different city huge venues that will end up abandonned right after the games. In my opinion it should be Athens, since they're the original founders of the Olympics, but that remains a debatable subject.

Not to mention the Olympic village and the media village who cost a lot too, and all the transports line required to fluidly get thousands of people from their hotels to the venues, to the shopping and restaurants, then to another venue, then to the airport.

Under that atrocious flag, Japan has colonized and killed millions of people, and Japanese government during that time did things that were similar to what Nazis did(to a certain extent at least). Do you see a German Nazi flag during any international event? No. Why? Because Germany acknowledges over and over again and teach that they have done wrong. The chancellor of Germany stated that Japan needs to address the issue of the ""comfort women"", but Abe does not budge. He says giving money is enough. all that the victims of Japanese imperialism, in this case Korean women who were taken advantage of by being raped and used as a sex toy for disgusting, filthy Japanese army, is a sincere apology from the Japanese government(that would be people like Abe, Japanese emperor, etc) by visiting Korea and telling the women face to face that they have done wrong. But Japan, not learning their lesson from the past, and still not teaching the history to young Japanese people, are prideful enough to raise this flag as if nothing happened in the past. Please, don't show your ignorance by avoiding the central issue and talking about how Korea didn't object about the flag in the past.

The difference is, Japanese government during the time of imperialism brought in many young korean women(and many other women from other Asian countries too) SYSTEMATICALLY in order to satisfy the Japanese soldiers of their sexual desires. The difference is it was systematic. It wasn’t certain Japanese individuals, but rather the leadership of Japan which represents the nation of Japan. Korean government didn’t do it systematically.

Japan has a history of deleting what happened in South Korea in the early 1900s, now a lot of you don't understand the pains Koreans went through.   My own grandfather was forced to be a teacher under the Japanese rule, these things are not made up and clearly noted in Korean history books and taught in school.   If you want to erase history of Koreans, it will not happen because Koreans want Japan to recognize their war crimes just like slavery of black people is clearly stated in American history books.  

Before you judge the Koreans, try to learn the real history, a lot of stuff online especially Wikipedia have been edited by non Koreans with ommision of many many things.     I love the Japanese culture, I even have a bunch of Japanese cameras I love, even drive a Japanese car.   But Japanese government needs to put the real history of what happened in Korea in their history books.   But a lot if Japanese do not know the real history because their government has censored it.   Don't be ignorant and learn the truth.   Until then, Koreans will keep fighting for their right to be heard, right for the real truth to be known.   Don't bully the koreans, they are not making things up, millions of koreans suffered as whores, slaves, forced into Japanese culture, you would be imprisoned for even speaking Korean back then.",@BIGMACMCDONALDLEE,,18,2019-09-06 02:27:41

This reminds me of the movement to change the name of ""Sea of Japan"", some 10 years ago. To me it seems that you Koreans are constantly trying to seek anything related to Japan and make it offensive. Then, many other Koreans follow this movement through group hysteria and think that they are the right ones and entitled to force the world their views. I would not be surprised if someone in Korea start complaining about the national flag of Japan saying that it was also the national flag of  the Japanese Empire. While young people in Hong Kong are fighting for their freedom and the future of Hong Kong, Korean youth are so busy in dwelling in the past and sending spam e-mails to the world for stupid cause.

The wordplay of “something wrong with you” is witty, clever and generally on point - it juxtaposes the medical model positioning of impairment as meaning there is something ‘wrong with’ someone against the reality of the dedication, stoicism blurring into outright masochism and general rearranging of priorities seen in elite athletes, disabled and not. The smashing of the word ‘super’ hit home in a particularly delightful way. The whole ad is a very firm rejection of the othering of disabled people in favour of highlighting the extraordinary differences in the approach and attitude of all elite sportspeople - the entire point is that impairment is pretty much irrelevant.

I had taxis refuse to stop for me, many doors I was unable to open because of spinal issues, constant questioning of my disability even though I could barely breathe as well.

UgwEJtNHo5B9xuCTBPV4AaABAg,BA7mmH4M6A0,"The  Tokyo  2020  Olympics    successfully  held  under  the   shadow  of  once  in  a  century  global  pandemic  drew   to  a  close  on  Sunday  8  August  2021.  
                      The  Tokyo  2020  Olympic    successfully  held  under  the   shadow  of  once  in  a  century  global  pandemic  drew   to  a  close  on  Sunday,  8  August  2021.  These  were  reported  to  have  been  held  amid  extraordinary  restrictions  and  mostly  behind  closed  doors,  with  athletic  feats  performed  for  a  world  still  struggling  against  the  coronavirus.   The  world  was  able  to  watch  the  competitive  feats  of  athletes  in  TV   Channels  or  online.  Credit  goes  to  Japanese  government  and  management  committee  to  bring  it  to  great  conclusion  without  reports  of  pressure  whether  it  was  possible  to  accomplish  during  worrisome  concerns  of   pandemic.    
                     In  this  context,  it  may  be  apt  to  refer  readers  to  this  Vedic  astrology  writer’s   related   prediction  in  article shared  widely  with  Japanese  news  media  last  year  on  16  September,  which  reads  as  follows:-
                      “( 6 ).  A  further  period  of  one  and  a  half    months  covering  second  half  of   July  and  August  in  2021   look  to  be  stepping  up  endeavors  towards  economic  sector  growth.  Some  positive  things  can  come    up  in  relation  to  health  ,  particularly  Covid-19.  Some  ambitious    or  strength-giving  program  can  take  place  with  some  success”.
                    Yes,  the  ambitious   program  took  place  in  Tokyo  from  23  July  to  8  August  in  2021.  It  can  be  perceived  that  successful  conclusion  of  Olympics  must  have  given  strength  to  Japanese  people.  Yes,  news  reported  some  spike  in  positive  cases  of  coronavirus  in  Japan  during  the  period.  
                     It  seems  the  prediction  may  have  served  the  purpose.

I am biased because I’m from Chicago and was born in 79 so MJ was my entire basketball playing days from Junior high to high school he was the guy. I always had his shoes for basketball. So I might be a little biased but nobody is better than MJ. He did everything first. I still rank Kobe over Lebron because I think Kobe had that mentality and I think Lebron had the size but not that certain it that made MJ and Kobe different. I’m still wondering where to rank Bird because he had that it too. He had the I DGAF I’m going to win at all cost mentality but not the speed or strength others had. He was just determined to beat people. Ugh ranking players in eras is tuff. Way more physical when Mike and Bird played. Kobe had the same thing most of his career.

Ugz5MHJPxcfH2BGeToF4AaABAg,WuvLCqLuGGs,"Sounds like Kobe might have had a form of Asperger's and didn't know it. I recently was diagnosed myself. And I used to think I was a horrible person for not liking people or wanting to be around them. So I found reasons not to like them in order to justify the way I was feeling in public. It's difficult when whatever you're thinking is what flies out of your mouth with very little emotion. It's very difficult for us to put ourselves in the shoes of others, nearly impossible. We can't read facial expressions or take hints from people - even if we know them for years. We usually have a poker face on, emotionless - and something like Barnes throwing a ball in our face would get zero reaction from us. It sounds like Kobe would have scored very high in masking - just like me - which is why people never noticed. BUT always did notice there was something different about me. Like Kobe. I can't relate at ALL to that level of success but I can relate to certain things. People like that become successful and we mask even harder in order to cope. And we only get honest about ourselves with people we really trust. If we aren't around those people - we are going to be ""fidgety and antsy"". And you hyper-focus on whatever it is you love to the detriment of everything else in your life. To the point where all we care about is mastering every facet of our interest - whatever it may be. Now if you add an unbelievable amount of fame to that and I do not know what the result would be mentally. Perhaps that's why his guard was always up and why he looked uncomfortable so many times in public in the middle of huge crowds. And sometimes the mask would take over and he was charming as hell. But over time his public mask was larger than life by retirement time and he probably couldn't even have told you who the ""real"" Kobe was.. He was a very special but also very strange individual. I believe we didn't get to see the real Kobe as a person, until he was retired.

All those inuries at the time he 34 and he defending the likes of Wade, LEBRON full court

Jordan said that man is INSANE on winning if he could he would die to win it all and the only person close to that is myself I never seen anyone else except me ( Jordan) that comes close to that mental Kobe has
