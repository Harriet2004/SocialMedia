jnu4ih3,t3_14721e5,"Russian here. The brain drain has been accelerated by the war for sure, but it has been going on since the 90s. If you look at any leading universities in the world, you will find a lot of top scientists and teachers from Russia or USSR. And the brain drain is getting worse and worse every year, for the following reasons:  


1. Spending. Russia has been consistently cutting the spending on science and education year to year for a while, which apart from low salaries doesn't offer any top-level labs for the scientists to work in
2. Access to worldwide scientific community and conferences. With the war, it's nigh impossible for Russian scientists to travel to other places, attend conferences and participate in discussions. And science is global by nature, being isolationist doesn't work well here.
3. Propaganda. It's slowly starting to get inserted in the curriculum, which most real scientists hate it and want to stay away from it
4. Finally, being declared a foreign agent. This could happen for a myriad of reasons, but one of the worst consequences is that all your materials starts getting marked 18+, meaning that you can't teach school children or young university students anymore. Not to mention that it significantly hinders your attendance or participation in any local Russian scientific events.

> &#039;The main problem in Russia is this: over the past five years only Russia - no other country - has lost so many workers in the scientific field,&#039; said the vice-president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Valentin Parmon, the Interfax news agency reported.

> Experts describe the exodus of scientists from Russia as &#039;concerning&#039; and say it is important to maintain engagement with those remaining in the country to ensure they are not cut off from the global community and that scientific lines of communication remain open.

> A professor of Russian origin, now at a top UK university, who wished to remain anonymous told Chemistry World that this was not the first time significant numbers of scientists had left Russia to pursue opportunities elsewhere.

jnwn8o5,t3_14721e5,"As an aerospace engineering undergraduate, it’s tragic to see this. The Soviet Union was a juggernaut of space exploration, racing neck to neck with the United States throughout the Cold War. After the fall of the USSR, the Russian space agency, Roscosmos (Роскосмос) had to scale back its operations greatly, but still managed to contribute greatly to the International Space Station.

In recent years, it seemed like the Russian space program would be recovering, with missions like Luna 25 - the first Russian probe to be sent to the moon since 1976 - lined up, the Nauka module added to the space station, the Federation / Orel spacecraft to replace Soyuz underway, and Angara A5 finally launching. But, just as they were making all of that forward progress… Putin goes and ruins everything. Because of his hubris and vanity, the Russian space program is dying as many of the most talented Russian scientists and engineers are fleeing the country due to Putin’s insanity. 

While I hate Putin and the commanders of the Russian military, and all of the bloodthirsty vatniks who support this brutal war, I still respect the Russians who do not support the regime, or even outright oppose it.

Longer answer: It requires the NHL to adjust their in season schedule and open up teams to the liability of their player being injured when not playing for the team. In return the NHL got nothing back from the IOC. The crux was using Olympic highlights and pictures for NHL advertisements I believe. IOC played hardball, so the NHL backed out.

Honestly, outside the IIHF tournaments I rarely watch junior hockey so that explanation was very much appreciated. Really should get more into it now that the Hamilton Bulldogs are an OHL team not AHL. Very affordable tickets relative to the cost of Leafs tickets and still incredibly skillful hockey.

The NHL's official stance seems to talk primarily about schedule but it seems, like always, to be a financial matter. In this case, risk to their assets (star players) and who pays for that risk.

It's a shame, top talent attracts more viewers to the games. You just don't get that same level of excitement from watching lesser known players. ",The_Great_Mighty_Poo,,1,1,2017-12-06 03:47:41

The league itself has nothing to do with the Olympics, other than they have legal contracts allowing them to control the players and can be the asshole and make it hard for the individual players to attend even if they want to. One thing I have learned in life is that it's always about money, all of the time. I doubt that the NHL owners will lose any sleep if a couple players get injured in the Olympics. What they want is to steal some of the glory of the Olympics by making themselves seem relevant in the media. Also they are probably hoping to bully the IOC into some kind of sponsorship or kickback, but that's not going to work. All that is left are disappointed fans.

dqu35qn,t1_dqtsvj1,"This man is not wrong. Because the IOC's decisions functions largely on bribes made by host countries, it's been fairly common to see the games going to 2nd/3rd world shit-holes who really cannot honestly afford the games. 

Which brings up another issue: the games themselves are exorbitantly expensive, because the host nation is contractually required to basically build everything from scratch with the IOC offering a fraction of the cost, while the host nations government inevitably foots the bill. So after the games are concluded, host nations are often left with a crap-ton of otherwise useless infrastructure for sports that they probably don't even play with some of the more notorious examples being:
China's Beijing stadium lying in dis-use, 
Beijing and Athens both have kayaking facilities that are not used and probably won't ever be again, 
Brazil's stadium being looted, 
Sochyi being a ghost town, 
Atlanta literally blew up its stadium one year after the games and turned it into a parking lot,
 Athens has tons of abandoned venues, 
Vancouver managed to recoup most of the costs only 10 years AFTER the games were hosted by converting the athlete's village into housing units and only after a government bailout AND after the project went into receivership
Sarajevo pretty much doesn't use any of the venues with most of them abandoned (Although the bobsled course DID get turned into some kind of military artillery depot during the civil war so it did see post-Olympic use! /s ), 
Calgary's ski jump wasn't used for a decade+ before it was re-fitted, 
Berlin's facilities have long since been abandoned, 
Turin's athlete village has been abandoned,
Nagano was such a disaster that the Japanese literally (Yes, literally) burned all documents on the finances out of a sense of shame
ETC.

And this really does have everything to do with the IOC. Some of the funnier things they demanded of Norway for its Olympic bid included:

>They demand to meet the king prior to the opening ceremony. Afterwards, there shall be a cocktail reception. Drinks shall be paid for by the Royal Palace or the local organizing committee.

>Separate lanes should be created on all roads where IOC members will travel, which are not to be used by regular people or public transportation.

> A welcome greeting from the local Olympic boss and the hotel manager should be presented in IOC members' rooms, along with fruit and cakes of the season. (Seasonal fruit in Oslo in February is a challenge ...)

>The IOC members should have separate entrances and exits to and from the airport.

>During the opening and closing ceremonies a fully stocked bar shall be available. During competition days, wine and beer will do at the stadium lounge.

In short, the Olympics are a joke. It's a costly endeavor, where host countries are told by the IOC that they will be able to recoup the cost of multi-million dollar facilities over a 2 week period for the normal Olympics + 2 (ish) weeks of Paralympic games by the increased tourism. Meanwhile, the President of the IOC gets to live in a Swiss resort year-round to the tune of 750k+ in LIVING EXPENSES, (That isn't salary) and didn't bother to show up to the Paralympic opening ceremony in Brazil. The IOC is considered a non-profit and is based in Switzerland, so paying taxes simply doesn't happen. Media rights account for billions in revenue, yet the actual athletes can expect tiddly winks for payment (0$ from the IOC. Maybe a medal, if they're lucky and the judges haven't been bribed...Any money they do earn will come from corporate endorsements and most definitely not from the IOC) and their accommodations are notoriously bad. Oh, and the organization itself doesn't actually share anything resembling accurate/trustworthy financial records so everything that we DO know about it, usually comes from leaked sources.

dqtfb58,t1_dqte3fn,"I'm sure that the fact that none of the players ever dreamed of winning the World Cup of Hockey has something to do with it too... 

One other thing that may make a difference is the stage at which some of these players are at. They are already playing the most competitive league in the planet, showcasing their skills on a world cup is not going to be worth it in terms of getting recognition and perhaps a better contract as they are already at that level. 

With soccer players, because there are so many competitive leagues in Europe, most want to play in as many international tournaments as they can as it is, or can be, a launchpad to their career.

dqtpdaa,t1_dqte3fn,"The history is that in the 1960s, after putting up with two decades of the Soviets pretending their pro hockey players were amateurs and the extremely anti-Canada IIHF tacitly endorsing it, Canada launched a boycott of all international competition.  We did not compete in hockey in the 1968 and 1972 Olympics, nor any world championships in that time.  This actually created a big problem for the IIHF, because as much as they (particularly Bunny Ahearne) hated Canada, our media was pretty much the only group willing to spend money on their tournaments at the time.   So a lot of negotiations happened rapidly.   Part of the deal to bring Canada back into the fold involved the 1972 Summit Series between Canada's pros and the Soviet pros.  That was, in fact, the first true best on best hockey competition in history, since Canada's (especially) and the United States' pros were not eligible for the WCs or Olympics at that time.

Also coming out of those negotiations was the Canada Cup.  The first best on best tournament where any player from competing nations could participate.  They were held in 1976, 1979, 1981, 1984, 1987 and 1991.  The final of the 1987 Canada Cup between Canada and the Soviet Union is still regarded as some of the greatest hockey ever played.   The tournament was renamed the World Cup of Hockey in 1994, but since the NHL started going to the Olympics in 1998, the event fell by the wayside.  It was held again in 2004, but was mothballed afterward.

Now, since the Olympic deal with the NHL is in tatters, the NHL resurrected the World Cup.   The goal is to make it into a regular tournament held every four years.  The 2016 revival was a bit of a joke, but given time and proper management, I believe it can eclipse the Olympics the way the Canada Cup did during its run.",Resolute45,,4,4,2017-12-05 23:01:08

The result was an unfair, uninteresting tournament that we knew the result to when it was announced. 

The players also didn't care. My god did they not care. The level of intensity in the Olympics or World Championship was not there. The U24s and Europeans had nothing to play for, and it was an empty prize at the end anyway. None of the players considered it similar to Olympic gold.

Lastly, I actually like tournaments which include teams like Switzerland and Latvia.

Seems like soccer does something like this but it's handled by FIFA instead of the IOC, and that baseball and American football don't have to worry since they aren't olympic sports. Hockey appears to be in a semi-unique situation with regard to having high-value professional players that receive no compensation / insurance / benefits outside of national pride in exchange for the risk they take by playing. I now have a better grasp on why the NHL owners wanted to come to an arrangement and why the IOC doesn't want to set a potentially expensive precedent that could blow over into other sports / competitions.

A player like Crosby probably has an injury insurance claim in the millions of dollars if he gets hurt at the Olympics and is unable to play for the Penguins. Its likely that on other athlete at the winter olympics has a claim that large because the olympics is their main competition, and yet hockey has 30-40 of those players. The IOC was done taking on the risk of paying out multiple claims, considering how poorly the winter olympics do revenue wise and told the NHL they need to pay for it or they wont allow their players to compete. 

The NHL has always said they wont pay it (even though in my opinion they should) and took a gamble on the World Cup of Hockey in the hopes that people wouldn't be as bothered by no hockey at the olympics, and they can have more control over the competition.",4peak,,3,3,2017-12-05 21:02:26

1. Team owners don't want their star players getting hurt at a competition that they aren't paying them for.

The *most* accurate reason though is because **the players want to go**. The owners want to leverage that into a bargaining chip at the next CBA (Collective Bargaining Agreement) negotiations - to push the next CBA-agreed revenue split (and other stipulations) further towards the owner's side.

I have no doubt that the NHL players will be at the Beijing Olympics in 2022 - it's a huge untapped market for hockey (potential $$$$ for owners), unlike Korea. But the owners want to get something to give the players back Olympic participation.",Kattsumoto,,1,1,2017-12-05 20:10:14

But why insure players to play for essentially an exhibition tournament where the NHL receives no money for the participation? 

2.) The Games are in Korea, which is an unfavorable time zone to watch the games live in North America. If the NHL is going to make the investment in allowing players to participate in the Olympics, they are going to want their players to have exposure to a North American audience, in order to potentially garner more interest in the sport. 

Both of which lead to the logical conclusion of 

3.) Money - Insuring the players' contracts and having limited viewership of live games is unlikely to garner more interest in the sport, meaning a high risk for getting a ""return on investment"". The NHL would have to shut down for the entirety of the Olympics, so fans, largely, wouldn't be seeing the live games and they wouldn't get any NHL action during the Olympics, either.

You just cant compare international football to club football, they're just very different situations and there are different motivations. 

Of course club world cup will matter more to a south american team because usually most players who play for south american teams are unknown and they use this platform to do their best and expose themselves to world football. 

International football is very different because in this stage the squads already have players from very prestigious leagues and players dont have to prove anything.

That's not the case.  Like if you look at the Finnish, Swedish, and Swiss leagues, you'll only find two Canadians in the top-10 of scoring over those three leagues.  The Swedish league's leaderboard is dominated by Swedish players (two American, eight Swedish), and the Finnish league's leadboard is dominated by Finnish players (nine Finnish, one French).  Only the Swiss league's leaderboard is diverse and that's where you'll find two Canadians in the top-10.

We get to watch and endear ourselves to the stories that these guys have and cheer for them just as we would a normal team. And the thing is, these guys are still phenomenal hockey players.

ejf3y83,t1_ejf3qn0,"TL;DR: Just because a business puts up a sign or makes you sign a contract, doesn't mean it has any legal power. If the lost/stolen property was important or valuable, then you should do research and explore your legal options.

Potentially?

I think the point is more that it would something a court could decide, or something that might be covered by statue (written laws passed by legislatures)..

Like, an NDA, EULA, signs saying ""enter at own risk"" ""trespassers will be shot"" ""we take no responsibility"" etc etc ... those things don't necessarily have any legal power. It's up to the courts and legislatures to decide this stuff.

So if your lost item is really important to you, then you should at least explore your legal options and do some research.

For instance here is some USA information about the responsibility of a hotel/motel/inn when guests lose belongings:

https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/hotel-liability-for-guests-belongings.html

On a similar note, in Australia we have consumer protection laws. No refund policy can ever void our statutory (written law) rights. And in fact, companies can even get fined and court orders against them for giving customers the *impression* that the company's refund policy is in any way legally binding (it never is).

It doesn't say what size pizza or toppings or any of that, but let's just give them the benefit of the doubt and say that it's a large 3-topping pizza which Domino's (currently) charges $7.99 for carryout. That's $799 a year for 100 years, or $79,900 retail cost. I can't find any information on product cost, but I have to assume it's less than half the retail cost - probably even a quarter of the cost. But let's just go half, which is $39,950 cost to Domino's. At 350 winners, this deal would cost them approximately $13.99 million.

So I gotta ask - is it really worth almost $14M to have 350 random Russian people walking around with this logo tattooed? Good deal for the winners, though. I don't think they're living for 100 years, but $79,900 worth of free pizza for probably a $100 tattoo? Winner winner pizza dinner.

ejggly6,t3_b5ogg1,"A good PR stunt as long as public doesn't know about the details of the deal. Recently there was an article that unveiled the fuckfest winners have to go through. First of all, participants are obliged to pay taxes for each ""free"" pizza they order because legally that's an income thus should be taxed. Dominos says that it was the only way to make this possible, but I doubt it. 

Secondly, according to the contract, winners are obliged to verify that they still have the tattoo. It's totally ok and understandable, but during the first verification period Dominos scheduled all the 350 appointments to the 28th of December, the last business day in Russia. Obviously, many participants were unable to make it and therefore lost their contracts. Also, the contract stated that winner must visit Dominos at least 30 times a year (saving receipts), participate in other promotions and advertise Dominoes on their social networks. Otherwise, the contract will be terminated.

But the most hilarious thing is that the orders made with winners' coupons had the lowest priority and sometimes restaurants rejected them due to high load. So, basically, you could waste your free pizza coupon just 'cause you picked the wrong time to make an order.

This is the same group of people who tried to get a President impeached for lying about a blowjob, or for lying about planting listening devices. And yet Trump struts around knowing he'll safely complete his term until he loses the Senate.

All of this is being carried out by state legislatures, Secretaries of State, Attorneys General, and Governors the Kochs have contributed to and directed their network of fake grassroots fronts like Americans for Prosperity to campaign for them in elections. Once in office they begin this campaign as well as introduce legislation [written by ALEC](http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/21378/alec_agenda_american_legislative_exchange_council_janus), a 'model legislation' generating body representing the Kochs and other powerful industries, that personally [benefit the Kochs](https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2018/06/19/alec-deadly-asbestos-agenda-benefits-koch-industries/), [labor](https://mic.com/articles/21409/michigan-right-to-work-law-was-the-brainchild-of-alec-the-most-dangerous-group-in-politics#.1oibaPfRX) and industrial and environmental deregulation, tax cuts for the rich which coupled with [supermajority](https://qz.com/1245033/this-koch-brothers-backed-law-stops-states-from-raising-teacher-salaries/) laws is the cause of the drop in education and [rural healthcare](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/25/north-carolina-rural-hospitals-closing-vidant-health) funding, [stack the judiciary](https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2018/07/23/koch-justice-billionaires-expand-influence-law-enforcement-courts-2018/), and gerrymander Congress so their [preferred candidates](http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/21558/koch-brothers-super-pac-janus-unions-midterm-election-americans-prosperity) go into the House.

Now they're doing the same thing nationally. Trumps [Vice President](https://www.thenation.com/article/is-trump-ok/), many [cabinet](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pompeo-draws-liberal-groups-ire/2011/03/10/ABogK33_story.html?utm_term=.3ff6d4b7ff57) and [administration positions](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/30/donald-trump-george-monbiot-misinformation) are staffed with Koch cronies, more are [taking on jobs](https://thinkprogress.org/koch-epa-industry-david-dunlap-chemical-water-1f08cfa2fb01/) in various [regulatory agencies](https://tytnetwork.com/2018/05/24/two-koch-insiders-are-creating-a-new-office-inside-the-fcc/). And [stacking](https://maplight.org/story/dark-money-group-leading-kavanaugh-confirmation-not-authorized-to-operate-in-d-c/) the [federal judiciary](https://www.thenation.com/article/mitch-mcconnell-just-won-the-biggest-battle-yet-in-his-long-war-on-democracy/).

While the Koch network continues apace lobbying for 'right to work' laws, [opposing Public Transit ballots](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/climate/koch-brothers-public-transit.html), tax cuts for the rich that will save the Kochs a billion dollars, and spending 400 million on this years midterms.

They're not done by a long shot. [The Kochs want a Constitutional Convention](https://apnews.com/e84cdca5b568402398eabfcd2b6ada07). They have three items on the agenda for it already:

* Repealing the [17th Amendment](https://www.thenation.com/article/alec-wants-to-to-change-the-way-senators-are-elected-and-take-away-your-vote/) - the right to vote for Senators. It will revert to state appointment. Now think about this for a second: if the state legislature is unrepresentative, and it is gerrymandering Congress, and it is appointing the Senate - what role do you play? There are 32 Republican states, that's 64 Republican Senators. Just three shy of a 2/3 majority.

* Repealing the income tax and estate tax.

* A balanced budget amendment. Both of these will mean Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the ACA, the Department of Education, and all Federal regulatory agencies like the SEC and FDA and EPA and FEC and so on, everything the right have had a bee in their bonnet about since the 1930s will have to be dismantled and shut down or privatised because there will be no means to fund them and they wont be raise taxes or cutting the military budget to do so.

What else would they want added at the convention? With the control they will wield the sky is the limit, I think the [""locks and bolts""](https://np.reddit.com/r/KochWatch/comments/8t0bxy/the_kochpinochet_connection/?st=jjy2ijn7&sh=82088938) against popular organising, against reversing the changes, against the democratic process and enshrining above all else the rights of the propertarian class that James McGill Buchanan, the key inspiration of the Kochs, advised the Pinochet regime on installing in Chiles constitution give a good idea.

The 'supermajority' laws prohibiting raising taxes are one example of the domestic application of ""locks and bolts"". Michigans 'emergency management' law provides another with municipalities having their elected government replaced with something appointed and run for corporate interests which would have tragic and irrevocable results for Flint. It was conceived by the Mackinac Centre - which was co-founded by Joseph P. Overton best known for formulating the 'Overton Window' for advancing unpopular policies one step at a time - and is one of the regional think tanks that coordinates with the Kochs State Policy Network.

In any other country you'd call this a soft coup. 

How do you stop this?

You can't vote them out, the gerrymandering and disenfranchisement ensure their minority has a majority of power. 

You fight this in the court and either they've stacked them or the judges rule in your favour and they just try again and [replace](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/us/north-carolina-republicans-gerrymander-judges-.html) the [judges](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/07/north-carolina-republicans-pass-bill-to-strip-state-supreme-court-candidate-chris-anglin-of-his-gop-affiliation.html) for the next round. If it goes to the federal courts (that they stacked remember) either they rule in [their favour](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/04/republican-voting-rights-supreme-court-id/) or its litigated for so long [the courts declare its too late to change](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/04/politics/north-carolina-court-gerrymander-midterms/index.html). Meaning that a 50.3% electoral result grants them [10 of the 13 Congressional seats](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article221282920.html#storylink=mainstage).

And what a surprise, Michigan AG Bill Schutte [opposed to the ballot initiative](https://www.bridgemi.com/public-sector/driveway-driveway-these-volunteers-aim-end-gerrymandering-michigan) to create an independent body to draw districts, ~~and is running for Governor  is [another Koch Brothers crony](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/07/03/schuette-americans-prosperity-california-donors/755069002/)~~.

> An anonymously run Telegram account has indicated that it wants to sell a tranche of emails relating to Russia&#039;s 2018 World Cup bid, after reports that they contain a dossier compiled by Russian officials on how to bribe Fifa executive council members.

> The email containing the dossier was allegedly sent in March 2010 by Alexander Djordjadze, the head of the Russia 2018 organising committee, nine months before Fifa&#039;s executive council delivered the 2018 tournament to Russia in a secret ballot.

> It is unclear whether the two sets of emails are connected, although BlackMirror said it has emails dated up to 2019, indicating more recent access to Kapkov&#039;s account.

fl6wv8i,t1_fl5jwdr,"Very interesting paper. Personally, I think GDP X GDP per capita is an interesting indicator, although I really think analysis of military power should really be decoupled from any GDP indicators and analysed separately. 

In my opinion, economic indicators in general are awfully bad indicators of military effectiveness, and the author's assumption that higher gdp per capita = more effective soldiers and efficient use of resources is questionable. It might be statistically true *on average*, but the discrepancies are so large as to render such analysis meaningless. 

For instance, Saudi Arabia has enormous amounts of net resources and a high GDP per capita. Nontheless, they certainly do not get ""more bang for the buck"". $20,000 GDP per capita Saudi troops have proven to be less militarily effective than $500 GDP per capita Hezbollah or Viet Cong fighters. 

And as another example, Germany's current military strength would also be severely overestimated by the measures in the paper (it would probably be calculated to be as strong as that of Russia, a laughable proposition). 

I also think the author actually dodged the burning question by only analyzing China up till the end of WW2. It is definitely an important question why the military effectiveness of KMT and CCP troops differed significantly when there were no significant differences in GDP per capita or total resources. In fact China remained at near malthusian levels from 1894 to 1953 yet military effectiveness was drastically different in each war during this period. It was terrible in 1894, poor up til the 1930s, surprisingly resilient during WW2 (Japan thought they would surrender/lose quickly) and by 1950 Mao shocked the world when his troops routed UN forces almost out of the entire peninsula. Yet during this entire time there was no transformation of the economy. Neither a gross nor net resources approach can explain why near-starving peasant conscripts in the 19th century got crushed while near-starving peasant conscripts in 1950 were holding UN forces at bay.

Thanks for sharing the paper though!",Eric1491625,,6,6,2020-03-22 14:08:11

Fucking kidding me. The US is busy rigging their *own* elections. Don't need Russia to do it. Lol. Check out the exit poll data on Biden and Bernie. It is CLEAR election fraud in Biden's favour.   

According to the UN, exit poll discrepancies exceeding 4% signify election fraud.

Here’s what we’ve got so far: 

CA: Bernie -11.1%, Biden +15.3% 

TX: Bernie -11.8%, Biden +1% 

MA: Bernie -12.4%, Biden +16.2% 

SC: Bernie -6.6%, Biden +8.3% 

VT: Bernie -11.0%, Biden +26.1%

Figure on the left indicates the percentage of fewer voted counted for Bernie compared to exit polls, figure on the right indicates the percentage of votes counted for Biden in excess of the exit poll figure. “Errors” all favor Biden. This election (term used loosely) is running at 2x - 3x the UN-intervention level

hzvdet9,t3_t9nt2m,"
u/TheRealDanGordon has provided this detailed explanation:

> German delegates laughed at former President Trump when Trump warned them of becoming dependent on Russia for oil/energy. This dependence has lead to significant turmoil and conflict in the current war in Ukraine, and is increasing energy costs dramatically in Germany and all over the world. In retrospect, Germany's over reliance on Russia for energy was a terrible, terrible idea with big consequences.

Dozens of countries are already energy independent and they are not invading their neighbors, the idea that codependency keeps us in check is simply obsolete.

e2q8t89,t1_e2q8sup,"**Diplomatic bag**

A diplomatic bag, also known as a diplomatic pouch, is a container with certain legal protections used for carrying official correspondence or other items between a diplomatic mission and its home government or other diplomatic, consular, or otherwise official entity. The physical concept of a ""diplomatic bag"" is flexible and therefore can take many forms (e.g., a cardboard box, briefcase, duffel bag, large suitcase, crate or even a shipping container).

Additionally, a diplomatic bag usually has some form of lock and/or tamper-evident seal attached to it in order to deter or detect interference by unauthorized third parties. The most important point is that as long as it is externally marked to show its status, the ""bag"" has diplomatic immunity from search or seizure, as codified in article 27 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

Intelligence reports seems to suggest that the Russians didn't really have a preferred candidate.  They just wanted to cause chaos and turn Americans against each other and create infighting.  (which certainly has happened). 

But if you talk to individuals, there is a common theory that Russia wanted Trump from the start and did everything in their power to help him win.


If all three of the candidates were democrats, then it would support the latter theory.  If it was mixed, then it would support the former theory.

Theres always problems with the world championship. Actually, for a while there were 2 world championship matches because many top players defected for a while. Its a mess. See: http://www.mark-weeks.com/aboutcom/aa06d08.htm

The IOC should be proud of 1936 Olympiad. If you want to spin it politically -- it was the Olympics that Jesse Owens made Hitler look like a fool. The spirit of the Olympics is about sports not politics. The only polical message is friendly competition between nations to encourage peace. It's for the athletes and the fans of sport. In ancient Olympiads they would even sometimes take a break from wars so they could compete. It is people like Hitler that turn it into something political. 

If countries tried to ban one another or boycotted international sporting events every time there was some conflict, there would be no international sports whatsoever. If anyone should be embarrassed its the countries that boycotted the Russian Olympics in 1980 and the countries that boycotted the American Olympics in 1984. They twisted the spirit of the Olympics to push their political agenda.

### 47 floor, double-glazed window 380kg, crane cable burst

^(*Pro-Alpinist.ru* &#40;May 24, 2018&#41;)

> We craned the double-glazed window, the crane was mounted on a roof. The working load of the crane is 500kg, weight of double-glazed window 380kg + 45kg suction cup. From our part, no mistakes were made, the crane was additionally reinforced with loads, we checked and filled up the oil in the gearbox, while inspecting the cable we did not find any damages. The steel-wire cable broke, and caused a lot of damage.  
>  All are alive, no one has suffered. 
At the moment the work is performing under the reconstruction of the destroyed parts of the facade of the building.  
> P.S. Workers suggested to lift the double-glazed window with ropes. Each of rope has a force at rupture 30kN using a system of z-rigs, but this would have been much longer, but much safer.  
> The initiative and instructions to work with a crane did not come from the workers. Therefore, workers will not be financially restore the destruction, the whole burden of responsibility lay with the organizers of this event.

> From the video and article closest to the source; it would appears that the videographer's company specialises in industrial climbing and filming and was hired as part of the ongoing repair-restoration efforts around Moscow.  At this specific work-site the foreman/director refused to allow them to set up the hardware to complete the lift safely, and instructed the workers to use a the cable itself as a pulley.  (Possibly suitable for securing something, but not definitely not moving it safely.) or not to prevent the cables from crossing under tension. ~~Predictably would~~ *This could* have caused the lift to saw through its own cable.

I lack the language ability to find more information that would confirm/disprove this theory.

dtoh36g,t1_dto845u,"You wouldn't believe the amount of inhumane, counterproductive and often downright stupid laws these scumbags have passed over the last years. It's always the same - a law gets announced out of nowhere, the intellectuals in Moscow and St. Pete get upset, maybe 10 of them go protest and are usually immediately detained, there's some small outcry on the internet, and that's it. Rinse and repeat. This law mostly affects poor families in the regions, and they have absolutely zero leverage when it comes to policy. No one has any real leverage actually, but in the big cities you at least have the ability to make yourself heard. It's a sad state of affairs. 

But as a side note, working women in Russia are not at all disadvantaged and they often earn more than men on similar positions. I'm pretty sure the USSR was the first country in history that had explicitly stated that men and women are equal on the constitutional level. I was young when my parents separated, and my mom never asked a cent of child support from my dad, even when he offered to help. She has built a very successful career and being a woman was never a detriment to that, and I know a lot of others who are like that. Most women who complain about sex inequality in Russia are sort of the ""new-wave"" feminists or whatever you would call them over there. 

But unfortunately, when it comes to abuse at home, it's a different story. It happens a lot, and it is almost entirely due to alcohol. When you live in a shitty place in Russia (most of Russia), earn just enough to eat some shit food and maybe go to the movies once a month if there's a theater around, have to endure horrible living conditions and below-freezing temperatures for 9 months - you will eventually turn to drinking. Some do drugs, but alcohol is cheap, accessible and is basically forced down people's throats by the government. They are saying they want to fix the problem but it absolutely plays to their favor, keeps the population docile. 

And these guys drink a lot. When they don't drink enough to pass out, they will often get agressive and beat their partner. And this happens a lot, more than you can imagine.

Imagine you are a russian wife being beaten by your husband. You make a decision to come to the police and seek help. Now, before the law was passed, what were your options? You pressure charges on the guy, he gets sentenced for a year in jail. Not only you would put the person you somehow love in the Russian prison with your own hands, but you also lose a feeder and have to work twice as hard to raise the kids, which are now also fatherless. After the guy gets out he has significantly less options to find job. To sum up, life begins to suck much more than it used to even if he actually stops abusing you.

Now, after the law was passed. You come to police, the guy gets charged with administrative offence, gets 15 days in cell, learns his lesson, gets back. Repeat if necessary. 
The latter seems much more pleasant for the poor russian lady whose life is already not so sweet. 

Before this law almost nobody complained and pressed charges on abusive husbands. Now women would at least have a reasonable option if they choose to complain and therefore they probably would do that more often.

EDIT: Also worth mentioning that in Russia police is very lazy when it comes to actual work, so the investigation would take months, during which the suspect and the accusator would live under the same roof.",llevcono,,93,93,2018-02-03 13:51:48
dtop5f8,t1_dto845u,"no he didnt decriminalize it he introduced a ""stage"" punishment 
 first time he gets 15 days and a big fine 
second time he goes to jail for 2 years(as before) and gets double the fine ",SatanicBiscuit,,2,2,2018-02-03 18:53:55
dtp5vio,t1_dto845u,"That's wasn't decriminalized. It was moved from felony to administrative crime in hope to make prosecution easier. Domestic violence crimes in Russia is a matter of peoples not goverment, so you should take a statement and go to court to deal with abuser. Due to the fact that this procedure is a drag and many victims take back their statements completly removing any possibility to continue investigation police just have no desire to work on this cases. They just don't get paid for them. Due to this goverment decided to move it from felony type to administrative. It's still a crime, but first time offence with no damage to health counted as administrative crime and can be punished without statement, ofc punishment isn't that harsh either public works or fine or detainment for 1-2 weeks, but they go immediately after police come onto crime scene and regardless of desire of victim. Second offense considered a felony and also allow speed up prosecution. Basicly the law works like this: 1 offence - fine, 2 offence - jail.

But that's how the law should work, how it works in real life is a mystery.

The question that remain open for me is that why women do not divorce their abusers. There a plenty of stories of continued abuse and none of them thinked "" hey maybe i divorce him?"". I just don't get it.

Obviously society divided over this question. Some says that this should be a matter of family and if husband hits his wife - she should divorce him. Others think that goverment should intervene

Basicly the problem:
>Domestic violence(Actually this term doesn't exist in Russia, there it called ""Beatings"" or ""Fights"") was an article of private accusation, that is, until February 2017 the victim had to write the statement herself, collect the evidence and apply with the application for instituting criminal proceedings to the court. However, usually the victim, not knowing the difference between the composition of public and private charges, appealed to the police. Here in the typical story of family beatings came the district commissioner, whose main motivation was to uncover as many crimes as possible. For the precinct, this was an uncomfortable article. The victim often tolerated the abuser even before the application was filed with the court, and efforts of district police officer were not taken into consideration. He was well aware that the efforts spent on helping to gather evidence from the point of view of his departmental interest could have been wasted, therefore, in the most favorable case, the precinct officer only taught the victim how to file an application and get a medical certificate, trusting that the victim will reach the judge and the crime will be reckoned to him as an closed one. If the case of family violence was undertaken by the prosecutor, then as prevention, he led him to reconcile the parties. The villain was labeled to bring to justice, but not conviction.

>Thus, the victim of beating did not need to count on effective protection through criminal prosecution. At a time when the punishment for domestic violence involved imprisonment, 301 of the 25,400 accused found guilty of beating were isolated.


The idea how changes should improve situations:
>First, the police are now interested in accepting the application, because the number of formalized administrative protocols is also an indicator of work. At the same time, the effectiveness of the protocol is in the hands of the police: the procedure for working with the Code of Administrative Offenses does not allow the victim to withdraw the application. This motivates policemen to facilitate the gathering of evidence.


>Secondly, the judges do not need to spend time preparing a criminal case. Now their main task is only to consider the protocol drawn up by the police and check the facts. There is no incentive to dissuade the applicant, because now it is impossible to withdraw the application. At the same time, the possibility to ""justify"" in case of a reservation remained: out of 72,300 protocols for beatings considered by judges in the first half of 2017, only 51,700 were brought to punishment. That is, 28% of the protocols were rejected for one reason or another by the judges number of 4,500 cases (6.2%), administrative proceedings were terminated. For comparison: in 2015, 10,500 people (17.6%) out of the total of 59,500 accused were beatified.

>Thirdly, the judges were more often assigned punishment related to isolation. During the first half of the year, 4400 people were subjected to administrative arrest (8.5% of those punished). It can be assumed that the precinct officer now has more opportunities to isolate the abuser from the victim by applying detention measures before considering the protocol in court. As a result, the victims of beatings now had more chances of not remaining with the aggressor under one roof, as it was before, when the beatings were recognized as a criminal offense and required a private prosecution.

>Fourthly, the decriminalization of beatings has eased the work of social workers and psychologists. When the beatings were punishable, they did not always register and recorded cases of violence against children in their personal files. The high risk of criminal liability of parents worsened the chances for constructive psychological work, was disproportionate to the negative consequences for the family. After the beating was transferred to the category of administrative offenses, the motivation of social services to interact with the police and guardianship authorities increased.

>All this explains the seeming paradox: the decriminalization of beatings leads to the growth of social control, and not to its weakening. As a result, law enforcement agencies and courts have received more incentives to pursue the beatings, including domestic violence. Victims and social workers have less incentive to hide the facts of violence, since they do not now carry the risks associated with records of convictions in family history, and more opportunities to temporarily get rid of the offender.

dtohye5,t3_7uy3cu,"am russian, can confirm.

domestic violence is such a huge problem, it's so deep-rooted, that it is horrendous.

firstly, it's decriminalized to beat for *the first registrated and proven time*. if the woman shows up to the police, the chances are high they will not do anything. **IF** they decide to step in, the husband is fined ~30k (the average monthly pay in some regions is ~23k), and is back to beating her for the fact that she went to the police.

secondly, almost everyone is victim-blaming. it's always the woman's fault for everything that happens to her. if she speaks up, she is condemning herself to endless bullying from her coworkers, her family, his family, even friends.

thirdly, the official murder rate is non-existent. the government does not want the population to know that bad things happen inside the country at all. you will not hear anything on the news. you will not find official statistics anywhere. there are estimates made by organizations that protect people  (which are few and bullied by the government), and they are through the roof.

example: there have been incidents of school attacks by young boys, they have been covered by the TV media in summary of like 1,5 MINUTES. not per channel. AT ALL.

Albanians fought through the locker rooms, packed their things and left for the airport, while referee gave orders for the match to continue. Serbia was guilty of letting fans on the pitch, but Albanians provoked political incident on a FIFA event and fled the pitch despite being ordered to play. 

Also official photographic evidence of injuries suffered by Albanians were dismissed because they were all images of injuries suffered on the pitch during the match, i.e. several bruises, cuts and a broken nose one of their players had with one Serbian player in an aerial duel.

FIFA/UEFA/whoever completely ignored results of the investigation and only punished one side, one of the strangest decisions I have ever seen. Then again, even though Albanian lobby is insanely strong in US, UK, Switzerland and France, I don't quite understand even shady reasons for doing this. Makes no sense

Edit: And what about Ukrainian ""revolution"" where all their politicians tried their best to provoke Russia for over 15 years with various incidents, banning half the Russian things from Ukraine while Moscow kept fully open doors to Ukraine? The same Ukrainian government who was involved in more corruption and theft of public funds than anybody in the Balkans.

The whole idea behind their concept is to catch somebody out of position and exploit it, but since the Russians just sank ever more deeply into their own area, nothing could be exploited. They should have taken more individual chances running with the ball in my opinion.

I don't understand why so many people feel like Spain was the dominant team in this game. They had all the possession, but Russia managed to play almost flawless defense and executed their game plan to perfection. Just because you're passing the ball a lot doesn't make you dominant, and at the same time you can dominate the opponent without touching the ball if you don't allow them to do what they were trying to do.

e1ly0nj,t3_8vb5dn,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Spain's passing game. The tiki taka is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of football knowledge most of the shots will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Russia's nihilistic outlook, which are deftly woven into their strategy - their personal gameplay draws heavily from Trump's ""Build a wall"" speech, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these matches, to realise that they're not just good football matches - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Spain truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Sergio Ramos' existential catchphrase ""hit the ball or the defender"" which itself is a cryptic reference to something. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hierro's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Royal Coat of arms of Spain tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the Barca fans' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Now, probably some idiot journalists will scream about Putin's drugs, or possible cheating, but Spain, after the Portugal game, were completely mediocre in this tournament and didn't deserve anything special . In my oppinion, that penalty call at Ignashevich wasn't a penalty, they held and incomodated eachother . ",terreblanche14,,808,808,2018-07-01 16:43:17
e1ly0k9,t3_8vb5dn,"Russia played a very basic, but effective game today. Dzyuba was much better today than against Uruguay, he won a lot of balls in the air and generally offered an easy out ball when Russia were under pressure. I can't say I was quite a fan of the swap to a 3-4-2-1, however -- I thought it made them too passive and predictable. Plus, Cheryshev was left on the bench, and it just meant Dzyuba rarely had midfield runners supporting him in attack. Subbing him off when Cheryshev came on was also very odd.

Spain moved the ball well, and while it was generally safe passing, they didn't really need to try and score after the first goal, which owed much to the fullbacks pushing up high -- normally, fullbacks are more cautious when playing against wingbacks, but here the double pivot of Koke and Busquets gave Alba and Nacho the license to roam forward. Honestly, I don't think Russia would have equalized had Pique not left his hand up in the air, they're masters of strangling opposition to death with possession. Isco was also really good, he constantly drifted to the flanks, especially the left, then dribbled into the tight spaces looking to set someone up. Costa wasn't used enough today; he needed more direct balls in, and it's notable that when he *did* get the ball in the box, he'd be able to get a shot off as well. He's such a useful plan B, but Spain not playing to his strengths, means his inclusion can be a little pointless sometimes. Their tempo after going behind was really bad too, it lacked urgency.

After the goal, Russia defended really well, going into a deep block, and forcing Spain into making [passes like this.](https://twitter.com/Reunewal/status/1013447322817171456) Most teams would have gone with plan B, but Spain went with *more* plan A -- Aspas came on to better link up with the forwards, Iniesta came on for a quiet Silva, and Carvajal provided more attacking thrust down the right. Ultimately, it didn't save them from extra time. To put it this way -- [only 5 passes out of 757 made it into the Russian box.](https://twitter.com/othmannerisms/status/1013450395358826496)

Extra-time was more of the same, however Rodrigo Moreno came on to turn Spain into more of a 4-4-2, and while Spain turned the screw here, the Russian backline held firm, and eventually penalties settled it. De Gea was really bad throughout, almost every shot he's faced in this competition ended up being a goal and given his form for Manchester United, it's very surprising. The 2nd Russian penalty was particularly bad, I thought.

Although Russia were really impressive defensively here, this could have been a very boring 1-0 victory had Pique not given away that penalty. They lacked a real counterattacking threat initially -- Dzyuba was more a defensive than offensive option -- and when Cheryshev came on, they were playing far too defensively to use him well. Then again, they made the best of what they were given, and Spain did not.

""A player who deliberately stops **at the end of their run** and then feints to gain an advantage is deliberately breaking the Law.""

This ^ is the only reference to 'stopping' that I could find, so that definitely means to me that it is permitted. I think this makes sense, otherwise slipping halfway through the run up would technically be illegal, or being 

And also, in regards to feinting being up to the ref:
""[indirect free kick...] feinting to kick the ball **once the kicker has completed the run-up** (_feinting in the run-up is permitted_);"" So I believe that the referee's discretion is only in regards to whether or not the player has completed the run up.

Beautiful. You're right this is exactly why the wc is so special, it brings so many people together- friends and family, regardless of whether or not they like football. It's a universal language that can connect so many people.

Yeah my mom who doesn't give a shit about football cried her eyes out in 2014 when we got eliminated by the Netherlands. It was really weird but like you said, it's the special thing about the World Cup, it brings everybody together.

That special time every four years we turn up to see something amazing.

Some of us wait to see which European team will pick up the gauntlet and backhand Brazil all the way back to South America with their tails between their legs and their fans crying about their team ""being too much like '94"" and not having the ""footballing spirit"" that Nike told them they had in a commercial 16 years ago. 

Some of us wonder aloud as to what side like Cameroon, Bulgaria, Croatia or Ghana will turn up and steal the hearts of the Yankee's who have spent the last few weeks sitting at home trying to elaborate on their link to their great-great-grandfather's dog who happened to be a German Shepherd and as such they are technically 1/16th German. 

Whilst some of us are simply biding our days to see which of our neighboring nations will 'pull a France/Netherlands/Ireland' and completely fall apart in record time due to internal strife. Which, by the way, we do have to give a Special Thank-you to Spain for not even waiting for the Tournament to begin before crumbling to pieces like the Walls of Jericho.

For me though, it's all about what fun new way we will be completely and utterly humiliated.

Tough to top the last few humiliations: Ghost goals (real and imagined)! Physio's being stretchered off the pitch after celebrating a ghost goal (Imagined)! A turgid 0-0 draw against a North African and/or Central American team! EASY! [Sigthorsson!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaW1hqqyEhw)

We've had some crackers over the years, but this time I think we're all going to be humiliated!

Because Lads, It's Coming Home. and when our 'Arry tries to bring his suitcase back through and sets off every metal detector in the world with his Golden size 11 and the gleaming Jules Rimet in the bag, England will have come away with the biggest robbery in Russia since the Perestroika and everyone on this site is going to feel like a right mug when we have the cup.

I think Iceland have a reasonable chance.

They qualified directly for the WC over Croatia so they have favorable history!  I just love a good underdog story, but feel free to prove my points wrong lol


**Which powerhouse(s) have the hardest path forward to the elimination stage?**

Italy /s

Actually though definitely Germany.  They likely need two victories & its quite possible Sweden can hold them to a draw via the crowd the box strategy.

e0wt6bk,t3_8qw4se,"Man, rewatched parts of the GER-MEX game then rewatched some our former games, I just feel frustrated. We've always been vulnerable on the counter and we've always pushed up our FBs high, I can live with that.

But the fact that against MEX we were lazy off the ball and didnt bother to counterpress intensely after we lost the ball was frustrating. It didnt help that Kroos dropped in between the CBs to dictate play while Khedira of all people were allowed to roam forward. The whole point of having Khedira is so he can provide some stability and stay back but he basically played as a no 10 against MEX. If thats the case I rather have Gundogan in there smh. And having Kroos in between the CBs was no help either, he's shown time and time again how weak he is as a sole DM. 

Last WC and Euros, we fortunately had Schweinsteiger who dropped in between the CBs and provided stability. And even then Kroos was still close by him and the two would take turns pushing forward. Whereas against MEX, Khedira ventured forward like he's Messi or something leaving Kroos and the CBs by themselves and at times they both went forward leaving the CBs alone.

The communication between Kroos and Khedira has to be better. Khedira has to stay back for the majority of the game to gain some semblance of a structure. If Low is dumb enough to go all out attack then at least put Gundogan or another attack in cause Khedira is not defending nor doing anything helpful on offense.

I really hope Goretzka replaces Khedira in the lineup but I'm not holding my breath. I could go on and on about this game tbh, there were so many mistakes and the whole game screamed of arrogance and naiveness on the German side.

The match threads have been filled with people that keep complaining about the performances of the world cup teams. What are you guys expecting? The world cup is, with no doubt, the biggest sporting event in the world, but the quality of the matches will never be close to what we see in the champions league.

A national team can call upon the very best players from that nation. A club side can try to sign anybody on the planet. More importantly, the club managers work with their players for nine months out of the year. Repetition builds chemistry, which brings fluidity. Whether it's set plays or tactical schemes or basic movements, there is no substitute for teammates working together four times a week in training and playing together twice a week in games.

Contrast this with a national team coach. What does he get? A couple of days four or five times a season, plus a three-week training camp every other year.

That's why what you get in the Champions League is a proper team. And what you get in the World Cup is a temporary collaboration.

So can we please stop complaining and leave the match threads for actual discussion.",FingerButt99,,23,23,2018-06-15 17:06:45

I heard good things about fubo.tv? I don't mind buying a month if it means it will be easy for her to watch.

e0t7vi0,t3_8qw4se,I've been thinking a little about the KSA-RUS game and I've come to the conclusion that the Russian coach nailed his tactics. It was clear the Saudis were not comfortable in possession and the Russians sat back and waited for an error in the mid-third before launching devastating counters. I actually would expect KSA to do better against a Uruguay type side because Uruguay will dominate possession and the Saudis can sit in a low block and defend. Not saying they'll get a result (Uruguay should still win fairly comfortably) but I don't think they'll look as poor. The Russian coach knew that the Saudis would have no idea how to break down a compact and low sitting defence and therefore he set them up to play on the counter.

e13ytht,t3_8qw4se,"To people with stable jobs: how much do you enjoy World Cup or European Championship, Copa America etc? How many games can you catch?

Maybe I'm a little bit too obsessed but the thought of being unable to watch many games in such a tournament gets me very anxious about the future. Currently I both study and work but both my jobs are online and relatively flexible - so waking up early, putting a 6hr shift, then watching three games one after another (and keep working between the games for an hour if necessary) works well. However, I know I won't be that lucky in the long run, when I will have to spend summer looking for an internship position or working in a full-time position that requires leaving home.

I'm thinking of using all my days off for one-month period but here in my country you are lucky to have 30 days off in a year, especially if you've just started working - so this might be too optimistic. How do you guys cope with it? I'm 24, by the way. ""Huh, when you're 30 with two kids and a full-time job, you don't really give a fuck about what Panama does against Tunisia - just catch whatever you can in the evening and you'll do fine"" or any other similar response would relieve my stress. On the other hand, I may burst into tears, going, ""So you say that I will not care about WC in 6 years? Then what's the point of being alive when you don't even get excited for WC?""

In general I'm not that crazy but I have a soft spot for European Championship and World Cup for obvious reasons - they're held every fourth year and basically miraculous things. We wait 47 months for this and in best case scenario, we can enjoy 15 or so of them in our lifetime. I'm not a lazy fuck - I love working and I know how important it is to stay in shape both physically and mentally, especially having spent years lying on the couch. But please, let me take a break every four year for a whole month - just let me stay at home and watch ALL GAMES in peace.

e1blcy6,t1_e1ai75g,"Hi there. Thanks for asking.

I’m an American who currently lives in England since 2016. I tried getting into Club Soccer but it just didn’t stick. I am heavily rooting for England, however I am fascinated with some of the other powerhouses like Brazil , Portugal and Spain.

My favorite goals thus far are probably the German last second free kick (Kloos?) and the Jesse Lingard goal. It would have been the Moroccan guy from last night but he hit the bar.

VAR seems to be broken and way too subjective. I love the overall flow of the game, but I hate the diving/acting (borderline ruins everything for me). I’m also blown away that the post group games are decided by a shootout if tied. To me that level of magnitude should be settled by continuing a sudden death overtime until someone scores. 

Overall I can’t get enough! ",Kglee54,,2,2,2018-06-26 14:53:33
e1bq99u,t1_e1blcy6,"> I’m also blown away that the post group games are decided by a shootout if tied

Many years ago now, FIFA implemented what they called the ""golden goal"" rule, where, if a knockout game (or the final) went to extra time, then the next goal would win and the game would end (""Next goal wins"" as we used to say when we played as kids and people had to go in for their tea!)  This was to try to avoid the game going to penalties.  I can't remember how well it worked though.

As for the diving/simulation/acting - this is partly what VAR is there for - to try to stop that stuff, as well as getting the big decions right.  I think VAR will come in more and more and be used for more things, and eventually the acting and diving will be much less a part of the game.  Obviously players will get smarter in the ways they try to deceive the ref - it's a bit like an arms race lol.

Glad to hear you're enjoying the World Cup - I love them, they are awesome!

People keep forgetting this. It took a Messi wonderstrike for the world cup finalists to beat us after 90 minutes, when we had a *far* weaker team than we do now. 

We just won and kept a clean sheet against one of the best African sides, *without* our most important player, with our best player getting injured during the game, and with one of our best attacking players being unfit to start the game. 

Cristiano is well capable of smashing us and bringing us right back down to earth- but a lot of people are acting like it's set in stone that he'll demolish us and completely writing off their chances which I don't think is very fair. Like you said, it will be extremely difficult and we'll need luck but its not out of the realm of possibility by any means in my opinion. We're a back-against-the-wall type team, and usually play with plenty of heart and desire when being outmatched and i feel like we have the ingredients necessary to pull off a miracle.

You're acting like Morocco deserved to win or something like that, whereas in reality they had 2 close calls- one which was a long range effort and another one was thanks to a fuck up in our box from Azmoun. The best chance of the game was ours as well.  Iran did exactly what they had to do- close down the spaces, and frustrate Morocco's attack and that's why they couldn't create many chances at all- and then when we were on the counter we would bomb forward in numbers to try and capitalize. There's a reason Morocco's coach even commended our performance. Also, this is without mentioning other factors how we were missing our most important player, as well as having one of our best attackers unfit to start the game. 

If we go to the next round (and yes I know how extremely unlikely it is), it's because we deserve it- unless in obscure circumstances where we get a crazy referee decision go our way or something like that which didn't happen in this game.

e0rg0bf,t1_e0rfeou,"> I don't think it's a hot take to not commend advancing because of someone else's failure

that's the thing though. If we advance, it wouldn't be JUST because of someone else's failure that we advanced. It would be because we defended well and did what we had to do to get results. It's a discredit of the work of the coach  by pinning our success solely on a mistake. We did exactly what we needed to do to win, created the best chance of the game where we should have easily scored- but instead the goal came from another moment of pressure. 

Meanwhile, Morocco created no chance even close to as good as ours and their best one came from a shanked clearance from our striker in the box... I don't see what the big shame is here that they lost. 

Not asking you to commend a potential Iran advancement from the group, just asking that you don't completely dismiss the work of the coach and the players to get the points that they deserved.

Germany should pull it but there's tremendous pressure and you can frustrate / counter them as shown by us in 2016 or Mexico. Their tactics rely too much on fullback pusing high yet the midfield isn't hard working or good enough defensively to cope with it. Leaves the CBs completely exposed.

I think there's also a case for Argentina. Their group is hard. They still have to play Croatia (50/50 imo) and Nigeria. They should win the latter but they could struggle if Nigeria pulls a great defensive performance. 

As for Iceland, they did the biggest part already. I feel confident they'll advance, probably instead of Argentina. 

Another shout would be Serbia. They can hold their own against Switzerland.",abedtime,,9,9,2018-06-19 01:11:19
e0wl465,t1_e0wjzis,"I forgot about Serbia!  that's a good point.  If they get points vs Switzerland, the big plus sign could turn to a negative.  [Switzerland miss elimination stage lol] 

I don't have anything against Argentina, but currently what I feel like is the ideal scenario for Iceland advancing is they draw or lose to Croatia who, on paper, have some better players than Iceland. 

Unrelated: If a new champion is crowned this year, I hope its portugal so Ronaldo can retire with every(?) possible major trophy.  That would be incredible to see.  ",ltralightbeam,,4,4,2018-06-19 01:31:28

Italy usually doesn't practice an appealing football, nor did Greece in Euro 2004. Fernando Santos, the Portuguese manager focuses on the result above all. And against weaker teams, Portugal has a tendency to suck. They know how to counter attack, how to score from set pieces, but to actually take control of the game... that's just impossible under this coach. And I don't really care, honestly. Portugal played amazingly in Euro 2004... and lost to the team that played ugly and had ""weaker"" players.",,,1,1,2018-06-21 06:19:31

But sure, I might be somewhat biased sometimes. However, I try to be intellectually honest as possible. And I remember growing up and watching Portugal losing to good teams but having ""moral victories"", since they played ""so well"". And I remember watching Euro 2004 and Portugal playing the best football they ever played. And they lost to a Greek team who FULLY deserved the win. Because if Greece didn't play as a boring defensive team they would have never won the Euro.

All that to say: as a neutral, I also don't like when the matches are boring as fuck. But I do understand where the managers are going with that. They are not being paid to put the team playing well.

e1zqoa9,t3_8wzc6y,"Such a frustrating game to watch. We played the same kind of football we always do: *""We're just trying to stay in this tournament for as many more minutes as possible!""* That's Swedish football. Always risk-averse, always fighting to not lose instead of fighting to win. Even when behind, the Swedish team simply *will not* take risks.

That's why I knew it was over when England scored the first goal. Sweden doesn't know how to win from behind, they don't know how to make a comeback. Either we take the lead early and turtle up, in which case we win, or we lose the lead early and *still* turtle up, still keep on playing as if we were ahead.

3. The political angle of the game would have dominated the media and spoiled the game.

All four teams have a thoroughly even lineup, react well to different play styles and adapt during the game, play an unrelenting game with quick counters and high pressure, and have both star attackers and midfield/defense to defuse the other team’s attack.

At this point it’s a mixture of injuries, strategy, and luck to hold a team back. No team is at a definitive loss compared to another.

By having the goalkeeper pass the ball to the shooter before they take a shot, as well as the shooter going over to the goalkeeper after shooting it gives the players a few seconds to interact with each other and get out of their own heads. I think it's a fantastic change to the usual grim fear inducing process.

I wish the same to you, I go to EU countries almost every month and I'm perfectly aware that media on both sides are more or less equally biased. It's just infuriating that many people from the West think of Russia and Russians as nothing more than few drunks in a isolated frozen wasteland (it's true in some ways, but it's far from everything Russia has to offer).

However most of us recognise this is your politicians not the people. 

But getting back to football, yes there was some fear-mongering about travelling to Russia but frankly you smashed the shit out of us in France, so it's not a big leap to think it was going to be worse in Russia. The fact it hasn't been it is a huge relief but I think a lot of England fans are glad to not be facing Russia in the finals. Politucally it would have been a shit fest too.

Then, the Lakers/Kings series happened, and you KNEW something was up.

There are venues throughout the world that hold a ticket-per-seat policy where they allow very young (cutoff is usually 2-3) children in for free as long as the parent carries them (popularly known in America as a ""lap pass""), but I doubt many of them would uphold that policy when faced with the gold rush that is hosting a World Cup match.

Yes, he had a (some would say unsuccessful) spell as manager of Oviedo in the segunda división, but it lasted only one year and that was his only management stint to date.

Essentially, the Spanish players are managing themselves. They don't have someone with an outside perspective who can offer a unifying vision or strategy, as Hierro has had absolutely no time to get to know this team. And without the manager's unifying direction, you essentially have a lot of players relying a lot more on their instincts, which for Spain is essentially tiki-taka.",Messisfoot,,36,36,2018-07-01 15:48:49

Put down the salt, forget that the 2 hours of play was......a bit slow.....and give props where they're due. 

Good on you 66th ranked Russia - you stayed motivated later on while Spain began moping around and in the end sent them home. I didn't think it was that far out of the realm of possibility, but the pundits seem to believe it was the ""3rd biggest upset in the history of the knockouts"" or something.

to be clear, I'm not arguing that this shouldn't have been a penalty, I just don't get why it was a red card.",Wargazm,,4,4,2018-07-01 16:49:09
e1m5piw,t1_e1lyfvj,"Good point. I do think the ref could have judged that the ball was beating the keeper regardless and thus intentionally arguing that Sanchez deliberately stopped a guraneteed goal illegally. Where Pique's handball still had a probable chance of being saved. But I will say, I wouldn't have been mad or questioned if Pique got a red card. He clearly threw his arms in the air to intentially stop a goal scoring opportunity.

I guess in this case it's similar to when a defender brings down a forward and is the last man and gets a red but would only get a yellow if there was a second defender nearby where the tackle occured..",Darkendfearz,,2,2,2018-07-01 18:44:07

e1m2h6e,t1_e1lyo0v,"I kind of agree - I think it was good old Rob Stone or Alexi Lalas who said ""uhhhh, raise your hand if you saw this result coming"" and I did, even though I'm at home by myself, because this Cup feels like it's been almost all huge upsets or ""totally unexpected results.""

Spain, at least in the 2.5 group stage games I watched, looked like they were frustrated and would have gone home in a second if somebody gave them a way to do so and not be accused of having no pride. Aside from the Portugal game, they looked mostly like they were pouting around and wishing for an out to go home ASAP without the public trash them. 

Of course I could be wrong, as we all only see what the broadcasters show us (especially with manager reactions and player facial expressions), but I too felt like there was well over 50/50 odds that Russia would handle Spain. 

SIDE NOTE - Akinfeev's final save for the win was pretty incredible, but were Spain's penalties half-assed looking....or is that just me? Russia's 2nd taker made 0 attempt to disguise where he was kicking, but had a look on his face like he was certain it would go in, and sure enough - he kicked it exactly where his body language said he would kick it, but De Gea couldn't even get a touch on it. Was  like De Gea was a full on ghost, and the ball just went through him. ",AVBforPrez,,0,0,2018-07-01 17:51:53

He's inconsistent like that for Real Madrid too. When he's on point he's one of the most fluid and hard to contain attacking midfielders in the world.

Other times he'll just kill any counter or decent run with him hogging the ball and dribbling in circles around himself while the team waits for pass... maybe.

e9idur5,t1_e9icfo4,The p<->b thing is somewhat of a sticking point in English when pulling from other languages. See for example the spelling of von Hapsburg and the neverending debate of p vs b.,troyunrau,,26,26,2018-11-11 21:26:30
e9jca41,t1_e9idur5,"It's a conflict between languages that differentiate stop consonants (p/b, t/d, k/g) by aspiration, voicing, or some combination of both or neither. English primarily goes by voicing, although initial consonants are typically aspirated if unvoiced - which is one of the markers of an English accent in many other languages.

Anyway, the primary split in this case between languages is between paying attention to aspiration or voicing. Japanese stops are divided by voicing (like ours), while Korean stops are divided by aspiration, which is part of why Japanese romanization tends to be a lot more consistent on the consonants than Korean does.

If you see something where 'p' and 'b' seem to be interchangeable in spelling, it's probably because the source language has an unaspirated consonant there and in English, in the middle of a word, both 'p' and 'b' are unaspirated so it doesn't matter.",wishthane,,6,6,2018-11-12 05:05:37

Romanization is up to local governments in Taiwan and changing names, especially familiar ones, is not considered a high priority. This basically means place names are written in a number of intery inconsisten ways. 

If you go to Taipei (Wade-Giles), you can visit Qixing Mountain (Hanyu Pinyin) which is located in the Tatun Volcano Group (Chinese Postal Romanization). If you go west, you will wind up in the city of Keelung (Postal Romanization of Minanese/Taiwanese origin). 

There are even tons of intersections with two roads using different Romanization systems.

It happened again before our eyes the receipt printed out a record that every vote was flipped. I voided the record and tried again. The record was correct. I cast that ballot.

Take a wild guess, which party do you think the votes were rigged to flip to?

Edit: Interestingly the ballot measures were unchanged. Just the party votes flipped. I don't remember much about the machine other then it kind of resembled a pinball machine with a privacy cover.

There we go. Gaslighting and personal insults. Rule #6. I reported this incident to the county board of elections when it occured and only recieved a form letter back.

Currently I have the impression that top teams in either stage are falling short in some way or the other, so I think it would be pretty even. Real Madrid recieved three goals against Juventus and Bayern Munich, for example. Manchester City imploded against Liverpool in the first leg of the CL.

>Let’s rewind the clock to March 2009, when Fernandes, at 18, signed his first professional contract with Grêmio. The day after, he went missing.

>After a 3-day search, police found him 700 miles away from Grêmio’s stadium. He was hungry, exhausted, depressed, and homesick.

>Without telling Grêmio, Fernandes had traveled from Porto Alegre to Jundiai to visit his uncle. He had fallen into a deep depression after signing his first senior contract.

>He saw a therapist to deal with his depression, but after, he would fall prey to the same insidious party lifestyle that had plagued so many Brazilian footballers before him. He drank so much that he would show up drunk to training, and subsisted on a diet of pizza & McDonalds.

>Still, that lifestyle did not obfuscate his obvious talent, and in 2011, he was called up to Brazil’s senior team to make his debut.

>It was a chance that every Brazilian player dreams of, and Fernandes pissed it all away: he went clubbing the night before and missed his flight.

>Still, his degenerate behavior did not stop clubs from pursuing him. Real Madrid and CSKA Moscow both approached him, but Fernandes rejected the money and trophies for a chance to become a key player at CSKA.

>Not only would Fernandes become a better player; he’d also become a better person. Fernandes began going to Moscow’s Brazilian Evangelical church, to which he credits his mental transformation.

e1u5ms9,t3_8v1jsw,"France v/s Uruguay : I feel that this is the worst possible opponent for France to face right now. They would have been comfortable against anyone else. Uruguay have been exceptional defensively and all the attacking talent and directness of Mbappe will be put to the test against one of the best CB pairings in the world right now.

I feel that Torreira is going to be the key player for Uruguay tomorrow. It will be upon him to manage Pogba and Kante. France won't really miss Matuidi and I expect Tolisso to slot straight in.

Cavani's loss is HUGE. Suarez alone isn't going to threaten the French backline unless there is a superhuman performance from El Pistolero. Stuani is OK but not Sexy Cavani.

Overall it seems like a single goal game and I'd go with France after a very scrappy affair. 70-30 % in favor of France. But if somehow Uruguay nick a goal I'd put money on them to defend the lead. Let's say the team that scores first will win.



Brazil v/s Belgium : Brazil have been incredible on the defensive side so far. Thiago Silva is marshalling the backline exceptionally well. The main concern for Belgium will be to make inroads into this defence and of course, get past the talented Alisson. 

Midfield gives Belgium an advantage as they have a plan B (Fellaini), while Brazil haven't had to shift tactically so far. Fagner seems like a weak point and I'd like to see how he matches up against Hazard.

Another important matchup here is Lukaku vs Silva/Miranda. All 3 of them are big and strongbois^^TM and it's going to be key for Lukaku to make some of his trademark decoy runs and run the defence ragged to create space for Hazard/De Bruyne/Chadli/Carrasco et al.

Belgium's defence has been underwhelming so far. They concede too much goals from open play and if that isn't taken care of, Brazil will win this easily. 

If, however Belgium nick a goal or two in the first 30 minutes, it will be VERY interesting to see how Brazil deals with the ghosts of 2014.

Devastated for the South American teams' performance in Russia 2018. Not even sure how to rationalize how this newest failure even happened. By next World Cup, it will have been two decades since a team from the Americas won the World Cup.

What is central to the region's failure to win a World Cup in the last 20 years is the poor mentality and ethics within CONMEBOL's football associations. European federations don't have clean hands but if you look at what Germany undertook as a project in 2000, Spain's commitment to developing young footballers, and even England's concentrated effort to improve footballing infrastructure at the grassroots level, you can tell the FAs in those countries are nearly 100% committed to building a path towards success. How I wish even ONE South American country had that kind of vision and forward-thinking.

Mentality is another obstacle. It's time to ditch the arrogance and superiority complex. CONMEBOL has the most competitive qualifiers but Europe undoubtedly have the better teams and better structure. Brazil were the best South American team in the World Cup by some margin and just could not break down Europe's 3rd-4th best team. Their coaching manuals, regimens, and standards are the highest in the world, rivalled in the Americas only by Argentina. Additionally, the willingness of even mid-tier European nations to give their countrymen a chance at the helm of the national team goes against the popular and mediocre tradition of lesser South American teams to opt for the Argentinian/Uruguayan/Colombian choice over a national coach. Hell, Panama got spanked in this World Cup but the Ecuadorian FA (FEF) is talking about bringing back Hernan Dario Gomez to coach the national team because he's Colombian and ""understands Ecuadorian football"". guntohead.jpg

For me, it could be the X factor in this match-up. I have questions about how good Brazil can replace him. They need to be able to stop De Bruyne/Hazard from overruning their midfield. That being said I am leaning towards Belgium but overall it's hard to predict who's gonna win.

Concerning the mach between Uruguay and France. I think France might have an easier time with Uruguay than people are expecting. Without Cavani their offence loses some of its potency. Since Uruguay will stay deep, France will have to use crosses from time to time. Thus the key to victory is going to be to win aerial duels in the box.",Futbolbol,,14,14,2018-07-05 18:50:10
e1xynl2,t3_8v1jsw,"We wasted a generation with really good defenders, it'll be really hard to replace them. A team that has Geromel in the bench must have a fucking godly defense. Marcelo will be old, Filipe Luis will be old, Alex Sandro isn't even close to them. On the right, we'll still suck.

On the other hand, our midfield and attack might be stacked in 2022. Rodrygo, Vinícius Junior, Paquetá, a more mature Gabriel Jesus, a experienced Roberto Firmino, Arthur, Coutinho, Casemiro with even more experience...and I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot of players.

Also, Neymar isn't and will never be mentally capable of leading a team technically. This isn't a job that requires only talent, it requires something else that he doesn't have. What we can do is hope that some of the youngsters grow enough to be able to share or even take that role from him.

About the game, Belgium scored in the chance they had and defended their lead well, Tite took way too long to make the changes and Fernandinho can just fuck off.

Congrats to Belgium, your team is really good, but there's a bigger monster in this World Cup and I hope you're prepared to deal with them. This France isn't someone you can just let play like you did with us. They're stronger, faster and more mentally prepared than we are.

e1n3qqf,t3_8v1jsw,"Logic dictates that one of France/Brazil are going to win the entire thing. But the way the 'big' teams are falling left, right and centre makes it feel that nothing is a given in this world cup.  Brazil have their work cut out, however. 

Mexico has a huge opportunity against Brazil. They can hit hard on the counter and give Casemiro a lot of work to do. A similar defensive performance akin to the one they pulled out against Germany (not Sweden lol) is a must. If somehow Mexico score very early, it will be very interesting to see if Brazil can exorcise the ghosts of knockouts in 2014. 

I'm still going to say that Sweden are going to make it all the way to the final. A really quiet and dangerous side, they gave us too much respect after scoring 1 goal. If they didn't shut up shop they'd have won. They are my pick for the finalists alongside France/Brazil/Belgium.

This time round Southgate is instilling a new ethos which is having a positive effect on the players. It's not a great side but a good side just like Colombia. 

From a fans point of view I'm bricking because of history. Because of bad luck. Because of the possibility of pens. Because we maybe nervous etc

I really would love them to show the rest of the world that this team is on the up. It's going to be a really tough game. But, win of loose, I want us to play great football.

If we loose I hope hysteria doesn't get Southgate the sack. He's a manager that is positive, with great pre-match  awareness and tacticle knowledge. He  knows how to guard his players from the negative and hype. He's played and fluffed his lines as a player with England. This guy knows the stakes. He's managed the U21's. He's come up through the ranks and that's how it should be. This guy knows exactly the quality of players coming through. We won the U17's world cup and we won the U20's world cup. Players are coming through who have valuable experience in tournament football. It's a bright future and better for it if he's manager. 

If we win let's keep our heads and prepare for the quarters.

The one that comes to mind was the 90th minute run into the box with Alderwield on him, he had the chance to try and setup Firmino for a tap in even with the defender on him, but nope he tries to take too many touches for himself and dribbles right out of play with no challenge.

* Matuidi had no business backtracking with Mercado when Hernandez was already in a position to mark him and Hernandez wasn't quick enough to put pressure on Di Maria/Messi when Matuidi left acres of empty space behind him. Leave the opposition's two most dangerous players with tons of empty space and something will happen. Not necessarily a 30-yard goal-of-the-tournament contender but something will.
* Pavard had absolutely no clue what his job was after the freekick was taken when he clearly should've moved to mark Mercado after Pogba rushed out to block Messi's shot. Either follow a tight man-to-man marking plan when defending freekicks or practice dynamic marking enough to avoid situations like this.
* A team with France's ambition should NOT concede goals like the third. It's like Pavard and Varane were hypnotized by Messi's long ball for few seconds. Do that shit against Ronaldo/Cavani and watch what happens.

Argentina have a clown for a coach. A more organized team with a coach that knows what he's doing can cause France a lot of problems if mistakes like these aren't taken care of properly.",,,14,14,2018-06-30 17:48:33

Unfortunately France are the favorites at this point and I expect them to see Belgium through. France are blessed with quality all over the pitch and have the look of a champion team (Play good football when on song and win, play shitty football when not on song but still manage to grind out results.)

Yet again, Kantes performance will be vital to the match and he will be a brick wall against the patented Belgian counters. I believe the best form of attack that Belgium will have to adopt is a set play. They have tall strong players and have a chance of putting one past the French defence. Umtiti has looked shaky in some matches. 

The loss of Meunier is going to hurt Belgium. If Mbappe attacks through both flanks by switching sides, I could see him giving a lot of trouble for the Belgians.

It's going to be a very tight match and I'd pick France to win by 2-1. Not everyone's favourite result but teams who become champions make everyone else disappointed, including me.",,,12,12,2018-07-10 06:38:18

e1xsdap,t3_8v1jsw,"Re-watch the Belgium - Brazil game. Martinez setup an interesting formation. 


When defending, Chadli actually tugged in and became a DM, alone side with Witsel and Fellaini, , Vertonghen as a FB to form 4-3-1-2. This allows Belgium to overload the middle. I think Coutinho had limited influence because of this.



When attacking, Chadli switched to LM/LWB to form 3-4-1-2 ,  with Hazard and Lukaku as LW/RW and KDB as ACM. Chadli and Meunier are key to move the ball up field because of the technical limitations of Witsel and Fellaini. 



KDB is my MOTM. Outside one mis-pass, he did everything right. His decision making is truly unbelievable, he's like a chess player who sees several more moves ahead all the time. Every time he has the ball, Belgium becomes threating.



Lukaku is close second. Who would think he played so well out wide. He is also great at holding the ball and makes several great deep runs.



Hazard was great hold the ball, dribble the ball. However I am disappointed at his (no) passing selections, I think either he really wants to be THE MAN or he needs to learn a lot from KDB at making decisions.


Kompany didn't have a good game. The Brazil goal was a direct result of his poor pass. And his tackle on Jesus should be a  penalty kick.



All in all, all the Belgium tactical changes have great results. Can't wait to see how they face France in the semi.

* **Messi** did his absolute best and was the reason we didn't completely shit the bed today. **Agüero** did pretty well too considering he played so little.
* I can't blame **Armani**, **Pavon** or **Meza**. They're local players who had very little time in the NT prior to the WC and had alright showings. I wouldn't have included Meza for the WC but he did what he could when he was on the pitch.
* **Dybala** did nothing wrong. In fact, he did nothing. Because he barely had any playing time. At least he did more than **Lo Celso**, who didn't even play. I hate Sampaoli.
* **Tagliafico** was alright. Not great but he's an Argentinian defender who didn't fuck up massively and isn't a huge piece of shit so he's better than what we're used to. **Rojo** got us out of the group stage even if he gave away that childish penalty today... God, I miss Samuel and Zanetti.

And that's uh... 9 out of 23 players, a little under 40%. So I guess I was wrong: 39% of the team deserves better and the other 61% can go fuck itself.",PochoChorizo,,7,7,2018-06-30 22:53:20

Sorry, but as much as I would love Croatia to win it, their squad is too thin. Too many rounds left for yellow card suspensions. Too much dependence on the sublime genius Modric. Rakatic is great but he needs direction. so, in a one-off game - yes, they can beat anyone, but over a tounament? Sadly, no.


Spain?

Much more likely than Croatia. 

However, I just can't see them overcoming Brazil (or France's) firepower.

Maybe if belgium get to the final, then Spain could do it but I think that they are just too one-paced to deal with France or Brazil.

Spain don't have enough gears. They only play at one pace. France (especially) and Brazil (if they chose to be) are explosive teams and Spain doesn't live with that.

2) They replace Yuki with Ricc because of his experience and Lawson gets the second seat. In the past they’ve mentioned how valuable it is that they have a more experienced driver.

cj5xpsz,t3_2bhmlc,"Note: For all those saying ""keep politics out of soccer,"" realize this: At every moment, you're engaging in politics, whether you choose to realize it or not. Your continued participation in *anything* signals your complicity with that thing and the process that comes to produce it. 

In political science-y terms, it comes down to exit, voice, or loyalty. In other words, you can choose not to participate, voice your opposition, or keep your mouth shut about the things you disagree with and keep condoning the activity. For each choice, you pay costs.

Of course World Cup sites are political. That's why countries lobby so hard for them. To an extent, being the host of a major international sporting event legitimizes that country. Qatar is an ever more egregious example, since quasi-slave labor will be responsible for large parts of the construction of stadiums used for FIFA events.

We as football fans need to realize our potential power and hold the sport accountable. In a social media-driven world, you as an individual citizen have more power than you ever have to actually do something to clean up the sport you love. Or you can just choose to accept that corruption and exploitation is all in the game (so to speak), and you're okay with the process that brought you a compelling match.

To me, if you're going to have two or three small mixed teams of athletes  from different nations competing under the IOC flag because they can't compete for their home country for a variety of reasons, and you already have an official mixed team of athletes from different nations competing under the IOC flag, why not just put all of the athletes in the team that already exists?

dqtuf4f,t3_7hrpjs,"This is probably going to be downvoted to hell but whatever.

To all you fools saying ' The IOC has balls for banning Russia for cheating'. I have some bad news for you. Every country who wins many medals, cheats. I have a female friend who did beach volleyball at the Rio Olympics. She is Canadian. Here is what she told me (paraphrased):

* Canada wants to seem 'moral' on the international stage and thus does not have a large scale doping program. However, she has said she is friends with US athletes participating in beach volleyball, trampolining and gymnastics and EACH of these athletes is doping. EVERY.SINGLE.ONE. She also says that everyone knows about PED enhancement and everyone does it but it is not talked about extensively. It is the elephant in the room. From what she said, the doping by US athletes seems to be swept under the rug because of its huge influence on the IOC - if America were to be banned many other countries would boycott the Olympics in America's wake. 

Also, according to her, amongst athletes it is an open secret that China has a state sponsored doping program., just nobody really talks about it.

My conjectures follow from this point. I do not have proof of this - so take it as you will.

It seems that the reason the Russian 'doping ring' was 'uncovered' so suddenly for Russia was that the US was trying to punish Russia in any way it oculd for it's actions in Crimea and Syria. By twisting the hada of the IOC the US had Russia targeted. 

So before you guys all start moralizing about how evil cheating is in the Olympics, I suggest you consider that every athlete who wins Gold uses PEDs or enhancements of some kind. There are currently many drugs being developed that are untraceable by current laboratory methods and athletes have access to them. Also, most of the successful Olympic countries use them as it is impossible to win without them.

I will not share her name unless she gives me permission to do so (to protect her identity). ",Chaddeus_Rex,,-6,-6,2017-12-06 00:36:32

- A post insinuating that Drake requested nudes from his 18 year old date and her friends, without knowing whether or not they were of age

- A post insinuating that a minor was topless in Drake's dressing room

- A post about Drake possibly being connected to the porn-site Net Video Girls. This one is strange as fuck.

- The video of UK rapper Potter Payper calling out Drake for messaging young girls in England.

- Added the $530K settlement

- Added the big thread about CDAN - really worth a read, although questionable reputation.

- Added the comment regarding the model and dogbowls.

- Added the interview with Aya not being able to speak about sex with Drake because of 'court'.

____

New additions:

- Added more to the Bella Harris section including her dad's 'response' with the like on IG, because it led me to an old [StarTribune article](https://www.startribune.com/jimmy-jam-s-daughter-s-an-anti-kardashian/303679711/?refresh=true) where her mother is saying questionable things. 

- Removed the Lil CC section from unconfirmed rumors, as it was just repeated information.

- Added the Twitter video of the guy explaining his high school experience in regards to girls and Drake

___

More:

- Added Baka Not Nice under ties
- Added Adel 'Future' Nur under ties
- Added more information about the $350.000 settlement. Drake sued her for defamation, extortion etc. first, yet ended up paying her 350K? Hmm.
- Added a section about CDaN reputation under final notes
- Cleaned up the post a bit + some reformatting

___

Even more: 

- Added Shaye G's allegations
- Added ties to J Mulan who allegedly does trafficking for Drake and other celebrities
- Added ties to DJ Eric who also allegedly does trafficking for Drake

___

For the record:
 
I get a lot of DMs with people sending me stuff, and that's cool - but it has to be verifiable and sourced. I can't just post random screenshots because it ruins the credibility of the entire post. That's also why there's plenty of disclaimers throughout, there's an entire section for unconfirmed rumors and I specifically have a section regarding CDaN.

The same goes with the Omertá stuff. There's no doubt it's shady and something might be going on, but I can't include it in the post until there's more verifiably sourced information.

___ 

More: 

- Added the TikTok 'investigation' that's been done by 51bworld in these two videos - [1](https://www.tiktok.com/@51bworld/video/7365487401369750826?_r=1&_t=8mB1AUJTFxW) and [2](https://www.tiktok.com/@51bworld/video/7366024091083623726?_r=1&_t=8mB0gw1LOk2).

- Added an overview at the top of the post

___

More: 

- Added Drake's age at each section regarding the celebrity girls as requested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1co5vrl/drake_has_a_clear_pattern_of_predatory_behavior/l3cfy9a/).

___

Final edit: 

This has gotten to the point where I get spammed with Reddit Care notifications and constant DMs with people providing new info, or wanna argue why I'm wrong and that Drake is completely innocent. You can believe whatever you want - I have presented my case and if you disagree, that's fine.

I personally do not believe that there can be this amount of smoke without fire and to everyone of you who claim I don't care about the girls, but just want to see Drake burn - that's projection my friends. You don't know me, what I do or what I stand for. 

And let me just set this straight: People complain about me adding a YouTube comment claiming that's dismissible. Sure, you can think that, but it just proves to everyone that you didn't read the entire post. This post is to prove the **pattern** of behavior. I know that can be difficult concept to grasp, even though I've explained it several times in the post. 

If you saw the amount of screenshots of comments I have in my DMs your mind would be blown, but because I actually try to make a credible post with links to sources I did not include them. I could easily have added 50 more points to the unconfirmed rumors with all kinds of claims, but it's extremely time consuming to source everything and then write it into the post. It's never good enough for people like you, but that's not my problem - that's a you-issue - stop being a debate pervert. 

I've also received comments and DMs saying that I hope Drake actually did something to these girls. I only have one response to that: Go fuck yourself. 

I will abandon this account and there won't be anymore updates to this post. As I've written in the OP, you are free to take this entire post and do whatever you want with it. No credit needed, I do not care.

You made a ton of really great points and the possible correlation between From and the real history of the Beothuk people. I always felt that our history on Beothuk people has been criminally underrepresented. It’s fascinating how those people (the real people to “discover” Newfoundland) were actually able to survive and thrive here before being killed off. 
I would be over the moon to discover that your theory is actually correct and truly based on this.

As in, the colonizers that came touched (might have to do with r-word, or how they touched people/spread diseases that the Beothuk people had no natural resistance to), they broke (possibly the active killing of their people or the destroying their settlements) and they stole (which in my opinion is clearly connected with them kidnapping people, and even specifically children). 

Also seeing as some people from this show have worked on LOST, the possibility of game between ""Good"" and ""Evil"" is further evidenced. I think this show has clues that demonstrate the similarities with Lost. Even the fact the showrunners have hinted at the people in From being connected by something. 

Everything else you pointed out is so compelling as well. There were  many times I wondered ""Why would they point this out in this scene?"" / ""Why would they focus on this in this specific shot?"", as I was taught that when filmmakers focus on specific items that have no apparent significance, they must have a meaning. For example with Boyd, I believe you see the dog that one time, and then never see it again. It would be extremely telling if the intention were to show Boyd as the ''fool'' card.  


The ship being called Matthew and the area where they arrive beind called Boyd's Cove is also just too much of a coincidence. 

I had thought of something around the Beothuk people, newfoundland and the various trips made there, however what stumped me many times was the fact that the show was filmed in America and the fromvill residents are also American and they were taken from american areas. If this theory is correct, I wonder if they'll explain that or if it's a ""well it's an american show so... we picked an american location.""  


Anyway, I love this theory, there is so much detail and clearly some time put into it. Although I would say I think the talismans are Nordic runes. They are so eerily similar to runes I've seen, I don't think they are Beothuk symbols. Would also make sense seeing as Vikings were the first ones to have contact with the natives in Newfoundland and they supposedly had a bad confrontation with the Beothuk, which left the Beothuk apprehensive about following visits from outsiders.  


I really hope either your theory turns out to be it, or it's something very similar as it would continue the eerie supernatural vibes to this show. So far I've really disliked the alien and government theories, as well as thinking they really wouldn't explain anything.

jmnxo61,t3_13w7cik,"Whew, boy. There is a \*lot\* of speculation going on in here that I'm not sure that the facts can support. That said, there's \*also\* a lot of speculation in here that is really interesting, and I love. Which seems to always be the case for me, with your theories, lol

Personally, the parts that I think are the strongest are the parts that connect it to American history, because when you have a show like this where the phenomenon only happens in one place, you have to ask: why just that one place?

In my mind, there are two options:

1. To make it easy for the writers and actors, so that they don't have to deal with language/cultural barriers
2. The location is extremely significant to the narrative

And that's the whole list, imo. And there are a few things in the source that support option 2 over option 1. So \*if\* the location (aka, America) is significant, then we have to ask why. Colonization seems like a decent option. Personally, I've been wondering if at some point they're going to tie this in to the colony of Roanoke.

That said, this phenomenon appears to pre-date the formation of the United States, and yet only seems to target people within its modern borders, which is extremely curious, and points me toward option 1. Further, the timelines just don't add up, for me, and may point toward something else.

So at this point, I'm not willing to totally commit to the idea that this involves Native culture or deities, but I do think it's a real possibility.

I'm also not willing to commit to a theory based on an existing structure like the tarot, because I think the writers will likely want to carve out their own niche and mythology. I suspect that the end result will incorporate elements from many different cultures, though, possibly including the tarot. Many folks like to spend time trying to fit the lore of the show into a pre-existing mold around existing lore, like the tarot, or the fae, or what-have-you. But from a show-making perspective, I don't think that this is the kind of show that has neat delineations like that, because they're going to want to keep us guessing for the whole run of the show.

All of that said, I do believe that there was an inciting incident involving something \*like\* colonizers invading a sacred Native space and either intentionally or unintentionally creating this situation. Perhaps it's even pre-humanity, some creature from space that's been sleeping on Earth for millennia, or an antediluvian being of some sort that the Native peoples knew to avoid.

kdoh0mf,t3_13w7cik,"The card game theory makes sense mathematically. You cannot play a game with the wrong number of cards (i.e., people).

If a tarot deck, then there must be 78 cards. If a regular playing deck, 52 cards. 

We don’t know how many people are in town in the beginning, but there appears to consistently be an equal number of deaths and arrivals. 

In Season 1, episodes 1 &2, five people die (i.e., mother/girl, three in the clinic) and five people “arrive” or have joined the community (i.e., the Matthews family & Jade).

From that point onwards, Nathan, the drunk in the box, and the priest die and there are 14 “losses” (as mentioned by Donna) at Community house. Not sure if I’ve missed any further deaths in Season 1. That’s 17 total deaths, which means 17 cards (people) must be replaced. 

Season 1 ends and season 2 opens with approximately 20-25 (Eldgin’s estimate) arrivals. A few of those arrivals and the bartender die in the first two episodes. The deaths:
- (2) Old couple on bus
- (2) Stuck under the house w/Jim (includes bartender) 
- (2) Caught on street
- (2) Young couple hiding in bar

If there were 25 on the bus, eight deaths would mean 17 more people joined the community to replace the folks in Season 1.",,,3,3,2023-12-16 22:51:24

j89u6te,t3_110mq4n,"Hey, chief! As somebody who came into Cabin Pressure a year or two ago - recommended by a colleague, neither of us being Cumberbatch fans - it's a show that I've returned to regularly to laugh at all over again. I had no idea that Sherlock fans became so crazy about it, purely because I never thought about that before now.

There was a bit in either Dr Strange 2 or the latest Spider-Man movie when he did something that reminded me so much of Martin, but I'm blowed if I can remember it",jamesthegill,,115,115,2023-02-12 19:01:56

Hands down my most embarrassing celebrity encounter is the time I kind of cried about his Falstaff at him when I was fairly drunk at the Edinburgh Fringe Fest. He was VERY nice about it but I'm pretty sure he thought I was nuts lmao",urcool91,,87,87,2023-02-13 01:46:48
j89swn0,t3_110mq4n,"This is going to sound... unlikely, but I actually had to leave a LOT out to make the above fit the character limit!

There was, as there always is in online fandom, a certain amount of controversy that sparked within the Cabin Pressure fandom. One major one was about fanart, which I had to delete a whole paragraph about- there was a battle over whether the ways in which people were drawing the characters were too focused on the characters being too ""conventionally attractive"" (which eventually led to John Finnemore making an official [statement](http://johnfinnemore.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-hairline-of-captain-martin-crieff.html) on whether Martin is, in fact, bald). It also got contentious when the question of whether Arthur should be skinny or chubby popped up.

There was also a certain amount of splitting of the fandom over Martin's eventual love interest, whose identity I will not spoil but who I think, to a certain degree, serves as evidence for Finnemore having kind of tilted things toward Martin's character in the last two series. Some people loved her, some people thought her character was a bit too much and symbolized an overly Cumberbatch-centric direction for the show, some people were annoyed that their ships were jossed... These days, the vibe I get is ""Cabin Pressure canon is great and what I ship in my free time is my own business."" But out of the 3800+ fics in the Cabin Pressure fandom on AO3, only about 200 are of Martin's canonical romantic pairing.

Also, currently, there is a surprising number of fans who share fanon that Martin is trans, which is an interesting one. Not personally my headcanon but I can see where they're coming from.

If you were part of this very interesting era and can remember other kinds of stuff that's popped up that I forgot and is worthy of note, please let me know! My goal was more to give a rundown of the overall situation, and how it really was, overall, a pretty supportive fandom particularly as it got more specifically Cabin Pressure-focused, though if you have evidence to the contrary please alert me.

Finnemore stepping into Good Omens 2 is also an interesting micro-example of this above-mentioned phenomenon, as a whole new crop of people got into his radio work when he was introduced as Neil Gaiman's new cowriter. (It's basically the only reason I'm excited about S2...) There has also been a LIMITED amount of new crossover with Good Omens- I added a bit of my own contribution, actually, as a fan of the book for nearly as long as of Cabin Pressure- but not as much as in the Sherlock era.

Also, as you can probably tell a BIG goal of mine here was to attempt to get people to listen to Cabin Pressure, which I love dearly. You can start at the beginning, but the first couple of episodes can be a bit shakier and I always think that it starts to hit its stride in the fourth episode, Douz. (I had to cut this for space above, but with a few specific exceptions, the episodes are alphabetically ordered, and you can listen to them in either broadcast order or purely alphabetical order, which is what Finnemore intended.) Then it really only gets better and better until genuinely my favorite finale ever.",hannahstohelit,,91,91,2023-02-12 18:53:21

I don't know what will happen with the upcoming USSF presidential election, but even if a status-quo figure wins out I still have hope that recent events will eventually bring about change that will put us on a better path.

dpx7d98,t3_7ddvk4,"You're completely right. Things do kinda suck right now.

But it's important for us to think about what sucks, and whether it will continue to suck. The truth is that we've had a confluence of events hit us all at once, which is not fun at all. It's been hard for me to not be bogged down by that, but I think there's plenty of reason to not feel as though the sky is falling.

I have a huge problem with the idea of burning it all down. Yeah, I felt that way for a bit after the TNT game. It was frustrating, unacceptable, and so embarrassing that I actually spent a decent amount of time talking to my therapist about the way it made me feel about myself (which is slightly embarrassing in itself, but that's how much I care about this stuff). But by burning it down, what are we honestly going to change?

Let's look at the difference in player development from the start of our WC ""streak"" to the end of it. In 1990, the idea of domestic player development was virtually nonexistent, save for the college system, which is obviously not good enough to develop world class players. There were competitive youth clubs, but in terms of coaching they were significantly behind. Things picked up very slowly over the course of the 90s, and by the 2000s we had an increase in the number of youth teams, and a lot of foreign coaches (from England mostly, which is an issue itself) coming to help out teams for months at a time (thereby collecting an easy paycheck). Towards the end of the 2000s, MLS teams started creating high level academies, and in the 2010s we've seen a ton of new youth clubs created alongside them (I'm coaching high school soccer right now, it's easy to see that there was a boom in the number of clubs, even in the somewhat saturated Bay Area). We've now produced a few players in Pulisic and McKennie, who are teenagers starting games for large teams in the biggest leagues in the world. They're only 2 players, but there are quite a few players following them. They're not the first Americans to do well in Europe, but they're some of the first young ones, and some of the first that can potentially be up there with the world's best. I'd argue that their closest comparisons were Landon, who is perhaps our most talented player every, but couldn't cut it for a large German team while at their age and was forced to settle for MLS.

There is clear, clear progress on this front. No, it's not perfect. Yeah, there are major issues with pay-to-play. Yeah, we should be doing a better job reaching talent outside of the traditional soccer demographics. But there is extremely clear, undeniable progression on this front. I grew up playing in the late 90's/early 2000's, and the difference in coaching from then and now is remarkable. The difference in time that youth players put in now is incredible (we practiced maybe twice a week, the typical youth player is practicing 3 times a week, and is spending time on film study to complement that). Teams of my generation grew up playing solely 4-4-2, whereas players now grow up playing the attacking style that everyone demanded.

Now it's buried in Facebook somewhere. Maybe a few SG's had #savethecrew flags or tifo, not sure. If they did something, I guess it didn't work so there goes that idea.  
  
Anyway, I think we could send a very strong message if the ISC quarterbacked a one-time boycott of MLS Cup to send the message across. Nobody views the game. Nobody visits. Nobody writes about it. Something like that would definitely get picked up by mainstream sports media, right? Wouldn't they love to pick on any blemish MLS picks up?

dpx4chi,t3_7ddvk4,"What's funny to me is seeing we - the hardcore fanbase - rioting while the sport at large remains largely irrelevant to the US public. 

Like, what ground do the powers at be have to stand on here? They've been feeding us  potential for decades, yet by all measurable standards they're failing. The on the field product has not markedly improved - how can it when you're expanding at a rate of two teams every two years?; TV ratings remain largely stagnant, like honestly guys no one working in TV will tell you that a 2.3 rating is a healthy thing, and that's the HIGH bracket for MLS!; we just failed to qualify for a WC, which means no post-WC boom cycle; and with the whole Columbus SC debacle the owners just showed their true colors.

On the one hand the apathy means the powers at large can get away with it all, but on the other it's like c'mon guys, you're fighting over scraps here! Everything you've built and will build predicates on the World Cup, and now that's gone. How can you not acknowledge something is wrong? Next time your partners in business negotiate with you there will be a reckoning. I don't see how you can sell more expensive TV rights or higher expansion fees with a straight face. 

Something is deeply rotten in our system yet the relatively anonymity of the sport and its fans means that they can largely ignore us and continue, business as usual. 

What we need is a capitalist champion or champions. The only thing that they'll respond to is competition, which ironically is at the core of the promotion / relegation argument. Instead of competition within the clubs, we need competition with the league. There's tons of grass roots soccer support across this country - the success of Indy 11, Cincinatti FC, Sacramento FC, etc. etc. is a testament to that. The only way I see the status quo changing is if someone can organize those dissident factions into an organization which peaks all at once - not in separate years, but all together, with strong numbers and a stable business model. They need to show that there's an alternative, viable product to be had. 

And honestly? It's probably achievable. We have American [historic precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Basketball_Association), and MLS' on field product is not polished enough to be insurmountable. I hope that one of us reading here has enough resources to make it happen. Mark Cuban, if you're reading this, please be our soccer Jesus.

dpx3gpy,t3_7ddvk4,"I think MLS fans got and are getting somewhat played by US Soccer and MLS. 

For the longest time, we put up a lot of moneygrabbing shit from MLS because ""you've all seen what happened to the NASL"" etc. etc. etc. We had to reach a bottom line and ""sustainability"" because otherwise the league would fold, just like the other leagues in this country had. You wouldn't want that to happen, would you? So you toe the party line, and that's why the ridiculous ""fans of the league"" exist, because they've been told the growth of MLS is good for the growth of the sport in the United States. 

The problem is now, after constant expansion and a few self-sustaining, profitable teams, you'd expect that to change.  I do think we're probably at a point where *teams* have started to focus more on development of players than simply money making opportunities, but we haven't seen the same from the league. The Sounders moving S2 from free rent Starfire to Tacoma is a good example, and one that will absolutely hurt their bottom line in the short term. But it's good for the community of Tacoma, good for their business partners in the Rainiers, and good for the players of S2. That's not a move we would've seen 5 years ago. But at the same time, it's announced after the largest season ticket price hikes in the clubs history and potentially declining attendance... 

But we haven't seen those sorts of moves from the league, and the clubs are the ones pushing the envelope instead. The addition of more TAM would be a good step, as would the restructuring of transfer fees received, but where was that 5 years ago? We've already seen two of the most talented young defenders in MLS in Joevin Jones and Ambroise Oyongo leave for free because their teams decided another year of them was more valuable than some trickle down funny money. When/if Columbus leaves to go play in a half empty college football or baseball stadium, what happens to their youth academy and the players in it? 

I'm over it. Add in the largest source of news about the league being league-run and it just seems all a bit mickey mouse and plastic. I don't hope MLS fails, but I hope they open their eyes, and realize that fans of the sport in the United States are finally starting to push back. MLS is still probably the 3rd or 4th most popular *soccer* league in the United States, and more people wake up at 6:30am to watch fucking Bournemouth than a primetime MLS game. 

I won't stop watching the Sounders because I do think they're trying to do the right thing, and they do still feel rooted in the community, but I've no longer got any interests in season tickets, MLS Live, or watching anyone else. 

I think /u/OpenWideForSUMSoccer put it better than I could in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/7709r6/anthony_precourt_mls_betrayal_of_trust/doi3ieu/) though, and I'd recommend you read that instead of mine. ",,,26,26,2017-11-16 18:23:29

dpx3jeb,t3_7ddvk4,"Things are actually really, really great. Says this MLS/US Soccer fan of over 20 years. The state of the game in the US has never been stronger. 

1. We have a strong domestic league that is growing, getting better every year, and is (by most estimates) profitable. I took a sports law class in 2001 from a lawyer who worked in-house at the NFL. During the first class, he asked everybody to say something about their relationship to sports. I was the ONLY person to mention any interest in MLS (out of 100 or so). His first question to me was ""do you really think the league is going to survive?"" That doesn't happen anymore. 

2. Player development at the youth levels has come miles in the last 15 years with MLS academies. It isn't perfect, but its much better than it was. Pros are developing pros. No more Bradenton or ""Project 40"" or hokey MLS reserve squads. 

3. Pro levels below MLS are in a state of chaos - but they always have been. The old A-league and its lower level leagues added and lost new teams of marginal stability yearly. The only difference is now there is more interest in the game at those levels, and more investment, so the chaos is bigger. But look at what is happening down there on a team by team basis, and its incredible compared to 15 years ago, when I used to go to Sounders games and could literally count the number of fans in the stadium. 

4. The NWSL still exists. This in and of itself is significant, given the turbulent nature of past women's leagues.

5. The US National team player pool has never been broader or deeper. We have more players playing at a high level at home and abroad than ever before. Its not as good at the top as it has been at other times (that 2002 team is looking like a golden generation in hindsight) but this is cyclical. It is for every country. It won't always be like this. Why? See points 1-3 above. 

6. US Soccer leadership is resistant to change. Duh. This is the organization that has had one president in the last ten years, and that gave Kinsman a new contract after the World Cup, even though Arena and Bradley both sucked during their second contracts. The difference? People actually care about its organizational failings now. Nobody really cared before. Gulati ran unopposed. Its a sign of the game's growing strength that fans, media, and players are even talking about how fucked up US soccer. It being fucked up is nothing new.

dpxbfgq,t3_7ddvk4,"I was thinking about making a post about this yesterday, but I guess you beat me to it :)

I can't help but feel that I've lost much of my passion for soccer this year. Suffering from depression has made me lose interest in a lot of things I used to love. I've loved soccer ever since I first kicked around a rubber ball at three years old and I've kept my love for the game all these years. 

But the US not qualifying for the World Cup hurt me pretty deep. I'm first and foremost a USMNT fan. I'll never forget being at  a party watching the 2014 World Cup and leaping out of my armchair with joy after Dempsey scored the goal that momentarily put us ahead of Portugal in the Group of Death. I've watched basically every US game since then, be it a friendly or a competitive game. American soccer in general has always been a topic of interest for me, and I enjoy discussing how it can (or should) get better.

The US not qualifying, to me, was a slap in the face as a US fan. We're in fucking CONCACAF. We crashed out playing against a team where most of the players wouldn't even make the bench in MLS. US Soccer's complacent attitude before, during, and after this nightmare hit me even harder. Why the fuck was Arena even allowed to show his face in public, much less participate as an ""analyst""?  Why is Gulati pretending that this isn't a sinking ship, and why hasn't he resigned yet after the possibly) irreversible damage he has caused to US Soccer?

The US not qualifying had several implications beyond simply missing a tournament. One, it will hinder the growth of soccer in the US as casual fans won't be able to tune in to watch the US play. Face it, about half of you guys started watching soccer after the last World Cup. There's also the fact that Pulisic will have to wait five years until his next major international tournament. And it hinders our 2026 World Cup bid.

Ever since I started watching MLS I've been critical of its setup, including its lack of transparency. The Columbus relocation was another slap in the face, as it shows that MLS cares more about owners' money than it does about us fans. It's absolutely unfortunate that a whole city's sports fanbase is being fucked over due to  the greed of a billionaire. Columbus, as much as I hate them, have a great fanbase and were MLS's first team. Seeing them destroyed like this is just unbearable.

i7feq9m,t3_uivv0g,"**IV) Carlo Ancelotti is one of the GOATs**   
It grinds my gears when people go with the narrative that Don Carlo is just a good man manager, like that's the only reason he has won the Top 5 leagues (only manager to ever do that), won 3 Cups in Italy, England, and Spain, and reached 5 UCL finals winning 3 (or 4, we'll see).   
  
Tactically, Don Carlo started out as a traditional 442 manager with Parma but later switched to 3412 at Juventus to accommodate Zidane in the n.10 role. Then at Milan he switched again to 4321 (known as the Christmas Tree) and transferred attacking midfielder Pirlo to the world best deep lying playmaker and had Inzaghi as the lone striker.   
   
When he moved to Chelsea he played a 442 Diamond with Lampard and Ballack as box to box mids. Then at Real he yet again switched to 433 to have CR7 at his best position as a left inside forward.   
   
This fluidity and adaptability was crucial in his success as a manager by allowing players to thrive in their favourite positions playing with freedom to showcase their abilities. This instilled trust in them and made them produce their best output under his management. His teams were defensively organised and rigid but offensively direct and dynamic.    
   
Carlo Ancelotti is the pioneer of the category of managers that don't have a robotic system that they impose on their players, but rather those who customize tailor-made systems that incorporates players in their best positions having the freedom to express themselves on the pitch. That's why he's certainly one of the greatest football managers of all time.",PharaohLeo,,46,46,2022-05-05 14:11:47

Players who serve this style of football, are like robots who do everything mechanical, without plan b when the circumstances demands it. 
To be honest, to overturn a match like this, you need a crossing, you need a header, you need nerves. Something that Real Madrid has completely, and city has not, even in the minimum.

i7fivfe,t3_uivv0g,"I don't even know how to encapsulate just how miraculous this Real Madrid run has been.

Real Madrid were 17-1 to win the UCL at some bookies prior to their first game against PSG.

PSG were favoured against Real Madrid, were up 2 goals, and then within a 15 minute period, were dead and buried by a Benzema hat trick.

Reigning UCL champions Chelsea were favoured against Real Madrid, had fought their way into a winning position after being stunned at home in the first leg, but they would succumb to a late Rodrygo goal created out of nothing and fall to a Benzema header in extra time.

Reigning English Champions City were also favoured against Real Madrid, they battered them in the first leg at the Ethihad yet still only had a 1 goal advantage to show for it. After increasing their advantage to 2 goals on aggregate in the second half and coming close to a third, you could see them thinking already about Paris, even some of Real Madrid's home fans had left, hopeless -- and yet, City too would falter, stunned by one Rodrygo goal in the 90th minute, then stupefied by another within 70 seconds. By extra time Madrid's victory felt assured, Benzema inevitable, when he was taken down in the area and the ref pointed to the spot it was manifest destiny.

&#x200B;

Telling in so many of these games to me, was, for lack of a better term or words, 'championship pedigree', the degree to which Real Madrid had 'it' and the other teams lacked 'it'.

When these bested teams had their advantage, you could see-- you could feel them just playing out the clock, desperate for the game to be over.

I feel like this quality is what allowed Real Madrid to creep back into these ties, they smell blood in the water, they can tell when a team has mentally switched off just that little bit, and when they do unexpectedly strike back it is transparent how crestfallen the opponents have seemed once Real Madrid assert themselves, like they've accepted their defeat as being part of their destiny, as much as Madrid saw being the unlikely victors as a part of theirs.

&#x200B;

In the aftermath of this completely epic run, it's been really interesting and sort of hilarious seeing how some of the pundits have framed these defeats after the fact. Certain ones I've listened to have seemed to just completely dismissed or undersold Real Madrid's unique qualities in these comeback wins.

Hearing them tell it, it was all about the defeated teams' mistakes, how they set up wrong, how unlucky they were, that 'the better team lost'.

I know they're biased, but still bears mention, I saw a clip yesterday of Carragher boldly stating, with no doubt whatsoever, that City were the better team -- despite the fact that they had just played 2 games and came up short! Despite Madrid defeating a gauntlet of challenging competition en route to the final, and proving themselves more battle-tested than City.

So many of these post-mortem comments attribute the favourites' drawbacks to bad luck, like it could have happened against anybody, ignoring how much these teams have been outplayed, albeit in small but utterly lethal doses in certain cases, because it goes against the pre-conceived narrative they've constructed and doubled-down on.

It is beyond good fortune, this is a team that knows how to walk an opponent down, that has a brutally efficient, clinical quality to them.

Not only that -- but Real Madrid are already reigning La Liga champions with 4 weeks to spare, they had just beaten the team who bested City in last year's final, and before that beaten the semi-final team City had to make the final the same season.

Part of becoming a UCL power-house is knowing how to kill off a game, to put an opponent down and out.

Yesterday's Madrid win was not an isolated incident, Real Madrid have done this 3 times this campaign, multiple times in the past.

Consequent to the group-stage, Real Madrid arguably (and unluckily) had the toughest seeding route to the final, and yet, crazy as it is to believe, Real Madrid have qualified for 10 of the last 12 UCL Semi Finals, their 5th final in less than a decade, this team transcends luck.

&#x200B;

Byleth was okay on release but my opinions on her gets worse and worse in hindsight. I don’t really care about what franchise anyone comes from really or any anime sword fighter nonsense but Byleth felt like she was just designed with no passion. Especially after Steve and Sephiroth were announced it feels like they knew the immense work that was ahead and just didn’t give her design much love.

Bit unrelated but it's always a bit strange to me how English fans can feel so strongly about this - as a German, it feels like just one step further from the ""no alcohol in the stands"" rule in English football. 


Sure, everytime I fly over and watch a Spurs game I have a pint or two before and/or after the game, but  that's mostly because I'm there super early and take in the occasion - here in Germany I don't stand outside in a nice stadium lounge for an hour or so beforehand (well, we don't have one lmao) but instead drink my beer while watching the game.



Guess it just seems a bit strange that banning alcohol is such a big deal when over there you can only drink it in the very inconvenient 15 minute half time break or before the game if you arrive way early anyway.

He's ripping on people who have almost if not more experience in Wrestling now a days. The Bucks and Kenny specifically have done way more than he has.

Page said it all to Punk's face... in the ring,  man to man.  Pussy Punk decided to call out Page knowing full well he couldn't come out and again at the scrum.  Pussy move.  Not a shock from him.

Taking the piss out of us is not contributing positively to the dialogue, hence my original point.

If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck.

And it's also possible to be 'outraged' at many things but the whataboutism is tiring to deal with.

But if you're going to use relativism to minimise anti-semitism, you might be the one that has the problem.

This whole sub, from the moderators to the users has a serious problem with anti-semitism in the guise of 'anti-zionism'.

I didn't experience the one concerning Nelson Mandela, or Tank Boy, or Billy Graham, or plenty of others... That doesn't mean they aren't real for those who did, therefore I included them. 

As for the spelling MEs, I've seen enough myself to know that when a large number of people have reported the same alternate spelling, they're probably authentic. I know we are all fallible, that tends to be less true when large numbers of people have the same alternate memory. All of the MEs on this list have been reported and experienced by large numbers of people

-aroma and acid
-roast
-(you skip this one, but it's important) sweetness
-bitterness

The amount of water very much dictates how much of each of these gets extracted, not just how dilute the solution is. Other factors can increase the extraction without decreasing body: pressure, stirring, increased temperature.

Overall, I see eye to eye with you on much of this, just got those points.

There's usually a massive hype train that follows the World Cup and a great atmosphere that accompanies the tournament both at home and in the host nation. This has been replaced with growing moral resentment and a tepid atmosphere that has killed the interest of the casual fan.

This is purely anecdotal but we always set up work Fantasy Football leagues for the Prem and major International tournaments. We have an office of 300 and usually get at least 50 people signing up for the fantasy league. This year the Prem one has 54 participants, but the World Cup one only has 13.

With Dortmund replacing the outgoing Kagawa with Reus changed that squad dynamic so much that that has never been repeated. Going anywhere close to the CL final hasn’t been repeated either.

I hate our club mgmt but they didn’t have a choice when Mario forced them to put a low release clause that Bayern happily triggered that winter in 2013 which broke all of our collective hearts and led Hummels to not sleep for a couple of nights.

That backstabbing SoB made around 8M at Bayern and our mgmt could have offered him that much given that he was going to be the face of our club. But he went around saying he wanted to play for Pep. And we all know how that turned out. 

Despite that, I kept wishing he’d return and join forces with Reus again. They did but Götze was no longer the same player. Not even close. He did maintain his ego though and refused to take a paycut even though he was the highest paid player in the squad. That’s twice that he’d been thankless to the club and fans who supported him throughout his career.

That WC goal was a tough pill to swallow all around and didn’t help that it was him who scored. A Bayern player not a Dortmund one. Argentina losing to Germany again….a repeat of 1990 when Jurgen Klinsmann dove like an Olympic gold medal winning champion to screw over Diego and co.

India on the other hand have mastered the art of winning every game besides the ones that matter. At this point, it's fucking hilarious.

As a country, India needs to get better about appreciating sport in general. The crowd for the final was atrocious. It didn't feel like cricket fans in attendance - just India fanatics who couldn't appreciate another team playing well.

Also, you can make a really strong case at this point that Australia is the better ODI team anyway and that the final was no fluke. They came to India and won the ODI series earlier this year (and we even had Hardik Pandya available for that series). And then followed it up and split the two games with us at the World Cup, winning the one that actually mattered. Over 5 matches **in India** in 2023, Australia prevailed 3-2.

I would  recommend people to rewatch 2011 finals, the wankhede got totally silent  when Sachin got out and SL were exited as fuck..Virat was a youngster  then but he stitched  a important  partnership  with Gambir, during  the course of thier partnership  crowd did found  their voice but were silenced when Dilshan took the wicket of Kohli..You can watch it in highlights..Then Dhoni came and to his credit,  he started  positively , hit some boundaries..on the  other side  Gambir  was doing thing efficiently. With their partnership flourishing , a India win was becoming  more and more certain. This is when  Wankede became lively  and crowd found  thier voice   and atmosphere became electric..If we had in a position  to lose that match one sided like 2023 finals  , the wankede  crowd too would have gotten silent..

Fast forward  to 2023  the fans were totally  behind the home team when Aussiee were 47/3 and when  Head was struggling..But once the partnership  between him and Marnus ,it was becoming certain  that India  is gonna lose that too  one-sided. This is when the stadium crowd became silent and I can bet my life this would  have happened  In most the Indian grounds...infact even  the people watching cricket in a projector at my area became silent during  that partnership..Kids did got a little excited when review was taken against  labuchange but were disappointed quick..

On part of the crowd, people targeting ahmedabad crowd and bigging up Wankhede or Eden. Those are the same places where Sachin was booed and stones were thrown and effigies were burnt.

People don't seem to understand that the local crowd in Ahmedabad was not there to watch the match. Every single hotel in Ahmedabad was booked for cricket. The people who showed up were ardent fans who could afford those tickets. Not your usual fans who are rabid in their support.

Griezmann, looks like those lost finals made a proper soldier out of you. Loved your drive. You managed to be decisive almost every game, despite playing average sometimes. You compensated with magnificent work in defense anyway. Giroud, you deserve this WC. You've been just as important as the 10 others. This success is on you. Benzema, please be happy for them. Kante, you're my favorite player. Today doesn't matter, you brought us here. Your smile endeared us all. Your joy was contagious. Everyone is a better man after enough exposure to you. We forget how flawed we are when we hear you talk. You make better people of us. You're like Sangoku. Pure heart. Bet you'd fly on that supersonic cloud too. Lloris, thank fuck you won it. You had won shit. Now you are a fucking world champion. That mistake was just you having a big heart :) You saved us every game, just be proud of what you did. Umtiti, Varane, that WC was built on your backs. Thank you for those performances, you gave your all for the win. As a CB, this is inspiring. Hernandez you're a cunt but you're our cunt. And definitely a great player. Looking forward to watch you with Atleti. Pavard you made us go crazy with that goal. You made France go 🔥. Congrats on the legend/meme status for decades to come. Didier... This mattered to me for you. You're astute, you're a good human, you are simple, generous, humble. You know your job well. You know what it takes to win games, leagues, cups. Your country can never thank you enough. You became an absolute legend today. We should all thrive to have a bit of you in us. The others 12, god knows we're here because of you too. You kept this team a family, you lived it without envy. You just wanted to help the team. Help the country. And so you did. This is the only moment in life were all the grown men around you are crying like little bitches and i love it. I will cherish this team and what it gave me til the end. what a beautiful summer.

-They reached World cup finals for the first time in the History after he scored a awesome goal in semi-finals.

He scores a own goal to give a lead to France very early in the match.

He scores another easy but unlikely goal, this time, just taking the ball from French goalkeeper,Llorris, which he had ample time to pick or hit in another direction.

There was a pitch invasion by Pussy Riot

They gave a penalty by hand-ling the ball where it was a matter of opinion if that was natural or deliberate movement. Referee took a review and took the decision against them.

The internal drive they both have to keep improving and not experiencing the feeling of 'that's enough' or 'I finally did it'. Their never ending desire to always win is astounding.

Iran almost eliminated Portugal because the void between them has shrunk dramatically.

Fair play to all the minnows for a decent showing. I would exclude Panana from that list because I thought they were mentally immature.

e0qo5vp,t1_e0qmcx3,"Meh, I think that's kind of a shallow analysis. Messi personally hasn't choked, but his teams have. If Higuain and Lavezzi takes their chances in the last World Cup, we could be having an entirely different conversation,

Argentina have had great players playing with Messi, especially forwards - but they've never really had a good functional team. I've never looked at them and said ""wow these guys are a fantastic TEAM"" - I've always looked at them and appreciated the PLAYERS in the team. 

You could make a similar argument for Ronaldo and Portugal too, but Ronaldo has dragged them to victory at times, and Portugal have always managed to put out a functional (if not limited) side that defends well, is mentally tough and that allows Ronaldo to shine and make the difference for the team. Even though on paper you'd say Argentina have the better players. 

Messi needs to do the same with Argentina, and put the team on his back - or Ronaldo edges it for me. That's part of the GOAT conversation I think - being able to put poor teams on your back and carry them to victory.",baddaman,,10,10,2018-06-15 21:27:49
e0qqufj,t1_e0qo5vp,You can’t call out Lavezzi and Higuain and leave out Messi. First play of the second half he got a 1v1 edge of the box and he shot it wide.

e0qu2h2,t1_e0qt7vj,"I’d still take Messi over any player right now if I had to build a team from scratch.

To his standards, that shot he missed is a “choke” it’s not about what he did to get there, it’s about having that final moment of genius and winning the whole thing. With that said, nobody ever wins without a team effort. Maradona didn’t win by himself, Messi won’t do it himself. In 2014 Higuain and Lavezzi messed up clear chances, but Messi had a golden opportunity and hit it wide. By his standards, that’s a “choke”.",Attempt12,,2,2,2018-06-15 23:10:35

e0qor87,t1_e0qo5vp,"Yup, that is a reasonable take but what should be taken into account is that again this is tournament that happens every 4 years and is mostly sudden death knock out system. Simply too much variance to take any valuable information from. Remember that only 1 of Messis Baloon Dor years was a World cup year, and that he had Maradona, for some reason, as a coach then. Also losing in the finals on penalties/in extra time is just a tinny bit less skill than it takes to actually win it.",DreadWolf3,,2,2,2018-06-15 21:37:48
e0qp01z,t1_e0qor87,"I 100% agree my friend - but isn't that part of being the GOAT? Showing up in those once in a lifetime games and doing the business and being the difference between winning a trophy or not? Those tiny bits of skill add up, and Messi and Ronaldo are so close that those trophies are gonna make a difference.

Yeah, fuck Maradona as a coach and like I say, I think Portugal have had better, more functional teams that Argentina. And I'm not even saying that Ronaldo is the GOAT over Messi at this moment in time - but he will be if he wins this World Cup.",baddaman,,1,1,2018-06-15 21:41:54
e0qpp0q,t1_e0qp01z,"I guess, he will have better career(storyline wise) and legacy if he wins - but still if I had a chance to start a team and somebody asked me to pick one of those 2 I am still taking Messi.

Yea there is value in being the difference in those games, but lets take 2014 as example. Argentina has no midfield and their attackers forget how to score when they put on NT shirt. Di Maria is playing his best football tho and it seems that is enough for Argentina. Guess what Di Maria gets injured and now you have to wait 4 years for another chance. For all lack of function in that team, Messi could still have carried them only if only guy that show up hadnt been injured. Ronaldos legacy would be so different if Portugal lost a game he didnt even play in. Putting much value on international competitions will always lead to major mental gymnastics as amount of variance can easily override actual skill on display.",DreadWolf3,,4,4,2018-06-15 21:53:35

In 2018 he was one of three attackers with Giroud and Mbappé while Pogba, Kanté and Matuidi/Tolisso played behind them as CMs. This year the latter three aren't there anymore and have been replaced by Tchouameni, Rabiot and Griezmann while Demebelé took over for Griezmann in the front three.

Agasint croatia and italy he panicked and went full defensive and against france he made terrible subs that took the wind out of englands momentum,  like subbing saka off and bringing grealish for 2 minutes?

izpcs88,t3_zi3ek8,"Honestly other than disappointed we lost, I'm pretty happy with that. We arguably created more, and outplayed a very good France team over the 90 minutes. Obviously, it means nothing in terms of success - but I didn't really come into the game with high expectations, and I thought other than not scoring from open play we had a really good showing.

I think the ref definitely had a few calls, mainly against us that probably were fouls, though honestly I think the first penalty incident was probably outside the box anyway - and whilst he definitely didn't give Saka much leeway, I definitely don't think you can blame him for the loss.

At the end of the day, we didn't manage to score a single goal from open play in the game, and France did twice. Saka and Foden really impressed me, I think sticking with them either side of Kane is definitely the way forward - though I definitely wouldn't have subbed on Mount when chasing a goal - and I don't think I'd have brought on Sterling over Grealish at that point. But I've always been sceptical of his subs.

But yeah, disappointing result, but honestly I think it was a pretty creditable performance, especially given how frustrated I'd been by Southgate prior to the tournament with his tactical style and the constant 5ATB.

Upamecano and Hernandez are defensive liabilities imo. Idk if Deschamps is really going to give Saliba a chance this far into the KOs

It plays into the broader theme that France feel defensively fragile without Kanté 

The key to Morocco vs France will be in how Morocco deals with Mbappe/Griezmann and how the French try and break the compactness of the Moroccan defense

They will have to rely on Mbappés explosiveness or on Greizmann’s ball playing/Giroud’s aerial threat to have a chance 

I think Morocco could 100% win this one after how they are playing; putting pressure down that center/left side like how Saka did today might be fruitful",,,34,34,2022-12-11 01:54:03

Now, I know what it is: Football IQ. France is still an amazing team despite missing players due to injury, but they just commit so many stupid fouls that they're their own worst enemy. If this same French team plays just as stupidly against Morocco, then Morocco might actually have a chance to win it. France did great gutting this on out, but if Deschamps has any sense, he'll be using this game as a cautionary tale in training so they're prepared for the semi-final.

As for England, they looked threatening most of the time, but couldn't convert outside of penalties. Shame, since Walker did a great job sewing Mbappe up and Saka was phenomenal. Kane will get the lion's share of the blame for missing the penalty, but Southgate deserves criticism as well for taking Saka off, and he should've put on Grealish far earlier than he did.

izrne4m,t1_izqajot,"In a sense he almost got too close with it so people assume he was more likely to score than he really was. A lot of players will score 2 or 3 of those in their career, and people were expecting Rashford to score 2 from 2 chances in about the 90minutes of football Southgate bothered to play him.

The fact that a player who is so in form, who has done so well in the limited chances he's gotten, Englands joint top goal scorer this world cup with under half the minutes per goal of Saka, wasn't starting today was shocking.

The fact that he wasn't brought on til the 86th minute is criminal. 

People will blame the ref, but it was Southgate [and the English press] who cost them.",hosky2111,,-1,-1,2022-12-11 09:27:09
izrpxvn,t1_izrne4m,"You're being somewhat misleading by leaving out the context in which Rashford scored.

He scored against Iran and Wales, hardly juggernauts. So it's not like leaving Messi on the bench here. 

I will agree the biggest issue is Southgate, however on the day France were the more clinical team.

Kane should never have taken the 2nd penalty and as always needs to be saved from himself.",TaftYouOldDog,,1,1,2022-12-11 10:04:12
izrrjzj,t1_izrpxvn,"I don't think it's misleading at all given who England played. Senegal were ranked 18th, Wales 19th, Iran 20th before the world cup. The two best teams England faced (France and USA) rashford wasn't brought on til the 86th and 78th minute and England failed to score a goal from open play.

So it's hardly like it's more impressive that Saka scored against Senegal and had two deflected goals against Iran. Why was Sterling brought on ahead of Rashford despite only returning to training the day prior and only scoring a single goal against Iran. 

I actually blame the English media more for the penalty miss. Playing for Tottenham, kane scores the second every time. However, the pressure placed on players the second they put on an England shirt is immense, so it's not shocking he missed - why he didn't just chip it down the middle is the obvious question as there's no way lloris stands for it in that situation.",hosky2111,,-1,-1,2022-12-11 10:27:48

e0tr7oj,t3_8rsa1g,"Very impressed by how quickly Mexico counter attack. They were very brave leaving 3 attackers high up the pitch leaving options constantly for quick direct transitions. Lozano looked so dangerous. With Germany slowly building up possession and supporting it with their fullbacks moving forward I felt like this exposed the centre backs far too much. Germany’s midfield were also far too slow at tracking back. Hernandez’s movement is good, but once he’s made the space and received the ball, he was just far too wasteful. Mexico could/should have done more damage.


Reus was a good sub from Germany actually injected a lot of energy into the German attacks, which was important as for the large parts Germany were playing in front of Mexico too much, which Mexico were happy with to trust Ochoa from range and restrict the space in behind. Reus looked to get into the tiny spaces behind the defence from wide giving them a more direct output. 

Low for me was a bit too slow with his changes too. Reus on was the right decision, but I think they had to throw Gómez on a bit earlier considering how many times they’d get out wide and be left without an idea. I do disagree with the Germany miss Sane comments. He hasn’t really performed for Germany, Reus did well when he came on. The issues were more in the centre of midfield.",Thesolly180,,720,720,2018-06-17 16:51:30

e0tr7ge,t3_8rsa1g,"Really impressed by Mexico today, they weren't overawed by the occasion, didn't panic, they just sat deep, looked to prevent the Germans from slicing their defense open and then played direct passes into Chicarito, Vela and Lozano. Vela did pretty well, he's not just playing as a forward here but also a playmaker and even as a 'blocker', preventing Kroos from doing much with the ball. 

Lozano excites me the most though, when he was running forward on the counter you just felt *something* was going to happen, his electric pace and tenacity was a treat to see. They also posed a decent threat from set-pieces. IMO, this is the perfect template for beating a technically superior side. Only flaw were the heavy touches and subpar passing from the attackers, especially Chicarito, they could have been 3-0 or 4-0 up otherwise. I didn't agree with Osorio's subs however, I think keeping at least Lozano on would have helped provide an better outlet for when Mexico parked the bus. Layun may be fast enough, but he's not a forward.

Germany have been surprisingly naive today. Maybe it's not too surprising because they're usually due a bad performance in the group stages, but Kimmich was constantly getting forward and ignoring his defensive duties, and I counted at least 5 counters starting from his side -- 3 by Lozano, 1 by Vela and even 1 by Chicarito, and that's only acceptable if you're a massive attacking threat in exchange. However, he only created a couple of chances in attack, so it clearly wasn't a good trade-off. To sum up how bad it was, for Lozano's goal, Ozil, a no. 10, had to defend his zone.

Kroos wasn't impressive either, he was usually the deepest midfielder but didn't have the mobility or defensive nous to stop a counter; in the first half alone he got dribbled past 6 times. Germany's vulnerability to counters isn't something new (remember Algeria?) but tonight was just shocking. Kimmich either needs to time his runs better, or they need a DM to sit beside Kroos and cover the gaps that appear.",ebilutionist,,182,182,2018-06-17 16:51:25

Btw, if anyones interested, compare this game to Dortmund vs Munich during the 2011 and 2012 season, same concept and good strat from Mexico.

Kroos needs a guy who does the dirty work for him, but Khedira running mindlessly in front doesnt help him at all, he needs to be there if 2 or 3 mexicans pressure Kroos and create space for him or use the space he then has to create a chance, but he doesnt do that all. Özil was just as usual in any match we lose. Hes never completely invisible, but he also never is seen doing anything stand out worthy. And then it doesnt help that Müller kept going into the middle instead of staying outside. But i also think Mexicos Tactics played a huge part in their win today. They literally pulled a Dortmund and Löw didnt expect that all. They were ruthless in abusing our Fullbacks being too far upfront and then Mats and Boating couldnt really do anythign 2 vs 3. I think we can learn our lesson and make adjustment. Obviously people are gonna jerk off to this win, but we are still favorites as long as we make changes.

I remember there was a game not so long ago that during the first half Draxler-Özil-Müller were swapping positions so frequently that they were completely lost on what to do, but they stopped doing that after a while so I thought Löw at least knew when his experiments were going very wrong.

They had a few good counterattacks yes but that is pretty much it. No ball possession, no way of penetrating the Germans straight on. Just stacked up defending 24/7 and trying to keep the lead. Which is understandable but this match was in no way entertaining to watch. It is just the result that is surprising.

e0vetlo,t1_e0v46h0,"I thought it was very entertaining. Mexico had many counter chances that they would not have had playing short balls through the midfield. It was a tactical game and I loved watching it. Mexico stacking the back I'm the first part of the second half almost cost them. They started countering again later and it forced Germany to expose themselves late making it harder to build an attack. 

Great game that could have ended in a blow out for either side.

I think Germany plays the back midfield a bit different. You.cant send 7 and 8 all game and stay in defensive for with a team as quick as Mexico.",adonutforeveryone,,3,3,2018-06-18 14:41:58

Last time they never made unforced errors, the press constricted the advancement of every team they played against, and they were absolutely clinical in front of goal. Not sure why they didn't just have Gomez start if this was gonna be their game plan. I also thought Boateng's decision to sell out on a forward pass while being thr last man back was awful.

e0tvlaq,t1_e0ttqwb,This. Kroos and Khedira looked just completely flat footed playing up. The Mexican counterattack looked so fast. And what was the most remarkable was so little changed.

e0txhr7,t1_e0tr7n4,"Can some Löw apologist explain to me why he destroyed Germany's left side by letting Plattenhardt play while only integrating Hector into the team during the qualifiers and the friendlies? That was exacerbated by moving Draxler to the left, who isn't that well integrated into the team either. We could all see how Germany immediately became more dangerous as soon as Brandt was on the left. Before that, Mexico could concentrate in the middle and on their left to shut down Kimmich / Müller and the centre.

Löw also thought it a good idea to have Khedira play, who was a no-show in the last preparatory games. Not to mention Löw's utterly inexplicable love for Mesut Özil, a player who is neither willing nor capable to put in defensive work, nor to actually run towards the goal with the ball. The goal could have been avoided if Özil had not defended like a school boy. And the number of times Özil had the ball, had space to go forward, but instead stopped and played a horizontal pass, is mind-boggling. Back to Khedira: he should have been subbed off at the break, or never even been in the starting eleven.

Thanks to Kroos' having a terrible day and Khedira being shit and Özil being useless, Boateng and Hummels had to take on the role of playmaker, exposing the back  to counters. Then again, Mexico was terrible at their counters. It never felt dangerous - except of course that one time it was one-on-one against Özil. Useless twat.",,,10,10,2018-06-17 18:39:13

e0tun7n,t1_e0tt50d,"They just need true wingers. I would prefer Sane playing at this WC but It also works with Draxler, Reus and Brandt who are exceptional wingers aswell. Germany constantly tried to create chances from the middle so Mexico's defense could react the same way again and again. If they constantly play over both wings they can force Mexico to adapt and force them to make a mistake.

Löw is a good coach but he has the habbit to adapt slowly. One primary example for this is that he constantly tried to use Podolski at WC 2010 in South Africa while Reus was there as a much better player.",dsffff22,,7,7,2018-06-17 17:49:30

e0tz98h,t1_e0txk0z,"Tough to say because Müller is playing almost everywhere If you watch the heatmaps. Müller was very good with Lahm on the right side. Lahm used to run down the wing and then provide crosses. Höwedes tried to do this aswell but was not as successful as Lahm. I think Löw has to adapt his system for the match but a proper analysis requires alot of knowledge and work so I'm not able to do this. But dropping Sane for the WC, leaving Brandt and Reus on the bench seems like Löw planned to use his fullbacks to the long runs. We'll see next match how Löw adapts.",dsffff22,,3,3,2018-06-17 19:10:15

""Carry the ball into the goal somehow, and don't you dare use crosses!""

Guy has always had some of the best strikers in the world in terms of headers but would never let his team cross. Therefore teams just make the inside tight and immediately there's almost no way to combine or pass anywhere, hence why Germany always seems to have 80% possession but do nothing with it. It's all momentary sparks of genius of one player (see Reus or that Brandt-Reus combination today), and when it's rolling it's often rolling, but otherwise it's a pain to watch and very ineffective.",Com_BEPFA,,1,1,2018-06-17 22:32:26

Also usually he at least helps a lot in the defense to even out Kimmichs attacks but he didn't do a lot of that today either.

You are creating MAGA just by acting the way you have been for the past decade. Why else do you think his popularity shifted in his favor? By magic? 

I am a POC and went to a Trump rally. I had never felt so much friendliness in regards to folk who simply wanted to help their country. People of all colors, creeds, and religions were there and everyone helped each other out. 

I CANNOT say the same for any leftist-oriented event. Everyone was super judgy and on edge. If there was one thing that didn't subscribe to their playback, it was on SIGHT. 

You are being lied to. NONE OF US on this subreddit want to take away your rights or send you to camps. You have been sucked into the worst hysteria of a person in modern history. 

Like I am LIVING PROOF of a person so disenfranchised with the other side that they decided to switch. I would've been a Kennedy Democrat in the 60s.

mbzra3a,t3_1ilvk4o,">Anyway the last 5 years or so when watching major media, social media (ESPECIALLY Reddit), etc… it became easy to feel like I was out of touch or I was losing my mind. 

There's a youtube video that brilliantly covers this feeling with a non-political hypothetical in the intro.

[Reddit is a Psy-Op](https://youtu.be/V7GtYaruTys) by Flesh Simulator.

At least watch the intro, if not the 'conspiracy theory'.

>15 years ago I would have said I was a liberal no question. 

Same.  I started paying more attention in 2016.  Seeing all the claims on Trump were just too much, I thought, ""Surely, no one man could be so...."" and plain enough, when I looked up what was actually said or done, it was always a lot less than the claim, when the claim wasn't a total fabrication.

My vindication is how far they've devolved from then, the mass hysteria and performative accusations have only grown in intensity.  A fascist/nazi under every bed, lurking in every shadow, death threats, assassination attempts(plural).

It's all so absurd, yet it happens all day, every day.

I didn't need crowds to let me know there are sane people out there(nice to see the confidence in people to voice opinions though), but the crazy people continually doubling down while I sit here more or less the same.

That's what lends me confidence.

Today it hurts because we wont have those huge fights at bars amongs ourselves about ""who's gonna play offensive"" ""who's a better player for us"" "" who's should start from the very first minute"" every single goddam game.
It hurts that we will not be together with family and friends to scream all united from the bottom of our hearts ""Italia Italia"" without disturbing our neighbor because he's screaming too with his family and friends.
It hurts to see a stadium full of families and young children all wrapped up in italian's flags who sang and screamed for 90 minutes walk out looking sad at the ground lost in a world of pain
It hurts watching Captain Buffon cry, always our pride, watching De Rossi scream from the bench to let someone better and more offensive then him play because we need to win, watching the team knowing that the next time the will not be someone like Barzagli to help us defend.
A game hurts us, yes a game that still gives us emotions

dps11dx,t3_7cqjmc,"As I said in another thread. Ventura was complete shit from start to end.

The 3-5-2 was completely uneffective

From starters, Barzagli and Chiellini were playing almost as wing backs and this caused so many issues I don't even know where to start

- Offensively, both are less effective than let's say Florenzi and Darmian 

- Defensively, since both were so high up in the field, it left Bonucci alone in a counter attack with two not so fast defenders running late

- Using 3 defenders against a team that would play so defensively doesn't make any sense. Not now, not in the past, not never

- playing  this way they had a midfield with Darmian, Florenzi, Parolo, Jorginho and Candreva. Florenzi is highly more effective while playing on the side. 

- If the goal was to cross the ball every time it went to attack, having two good passing defensive midfielders would've been best. They could cover while the defenders were up against the tall Swedish defense. Plus they would distribute the ball way better than Chiellini, Bonucci and Barzagli did

- Insigne on the bench

- Belotti on the bench

- Marchisio on the bench

- El Shaarawy on the bench

- Candreva starting the game

- Parolo starting the game

- Gabbiadini starting the game

dpslmig,t1_dpsj7hn,">What happened in 98?

..


It was an OFC/AFC intercontinental playoff for the 98 world cup (but the games happened in 97).
Australia had its strongest group of players for a long time including many that played in Europe (Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka, Mark Bosnich, Craig Moore, Stan Lazaridis, Ned Zelic to name a few) and a well respected international coach who had us playing great football (Terry Venables) . Australia had only one other appearance at the World Cup and that was 24 years earlier in 1974.

First leg for the Socceroos was away in Iran - a massive crowd of 128,000 (in a stadium with capacity of 100,000) resulted in a 1-1 draw - with the socceroos being very happy to have come away with an away goal, and feeling very positive about the way they played the game.

The second game was at home played in front of 95,000 people in Melbourne.
Australia dominated the first half and was up 1-0... it was at this point that hearts starting beating faster thinking that this might be the year we qualify for the biggest sporting event in the world.

The second half continued as the first did and we scored a second goal early on! 2-0!!! We were dominating and it was a party in the stadium and we were on our way to the world cup!!! *We are well and truly on our way to France now* - was the commentators cry.

Shortly after a well know *serial pest* who had a history of interrupting major events (such as the Melbourne Cup horse race, and the Australian Open Tennis, the federal parliament) - ran onto the field and cut one of the goals nets. Play was interrupted while the officials worked out the best way to fix it. In retrospect this is the incident that a lot of Aussie soccer fans think was the key turning point in the match... with the break in play allowing the players to think too much about what may be.

To the Iranians full credit they stuck to their game plan and held their composure and scored two goals within four minutes to leave an entire nation stunned, and the commentators in tears.


>**Despite being undefeated throughout their entire qualifying campaign, Australia had again failed to qualify for the World Cup finals**. Along with host nation and eventual winner France (who as host nation did not need to qualify), and Saint Kitts and Nevis, Australia were one of three teams to not lose a game in the entire campaign.

Here is an awesome article that explains in more detail the pain still felt 20 years later from this loss.

http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2017/03/22/socceroos-tehran-return-revives-memories-iran-heartbreak

No they are not. The factors are the quality of teams in the region and the number of berths for the whole region not the number of berths per the groups the region decides to divide it's last round into. 

If CONCACAF instead had a last round with 2 groups of 5 the teams would be the same exact quality they are now but the advancing teams would have a better winning percentage in the last round of qualification. That wouldn't make qualifying harder for the average CONCACAF team than it is now it would just make the schedules teams play more random and up to chance. It would still be the same teams in the region with the same number of spots for the region. 

>Africa and UEFA strike me as the most difficult.

Africa strikes you as more difficult to qualify out of than South America? South America is clearly the hardest region to qualify out of while Africa despite having more spots than CONCACAF usually produces a comparable amount of teams that are capable of getting out of groups. Last World Cup CONCACAF with 3.5 spots had 3 teams finish in the top 16 how is Africa significantly harder to qualify out of than that?",-_-__-___,,1,1,2017-11-14 14:36:18

dpsjc6x,t1_dpsf08n,"The only Caribbean nations known for taking baseball even remotely seriously are the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. Of these, none come even close to qualifying out of CONCACAF in any given cycle and, historically, only one has ever managed to make it (Cuba 80 years ago, and that was sort of a fluke as well). 
The Caribbean nations that actually threaten for World Cup berths are Trinidad & Tobago, Jamaica, and Haiti - none of these nations care about baseball at all. 

CONCACAF is not a tallest midget contest. You'd figure that in a world where a 300,000 strong Iceland can qualify in UEFA you'd think people would be a little more willing to acknowledge that smaller island nations are not always as shit as people suspect they are. 

In their competitive history (which goes back just over 30 years), the USA never lost to Jamaica or Trinidad. In the last 5 years, they have lost several times and been knocked out of major tournaments (Gold Cup or World Cup) by one of these nations on two separate occasions.

Why is it that, for 30 years, these nations could barely hope to eke out the occasional draw against a USA or Mexico, yet in the last 5 they have been able to actually turn some of those draws into wins?
The typical answer: ""The Mexican and American programs suck and just need to be blown up and rebuilt!""

The actual answer (which nobody seems to want to hear): ""Maybe those little islands we were ignoring weren't sitting still over the last three decades and are just a little less shit today than we thought?""

>when the first two don't make it it should lead to profound re-evaluation of everything concerning your program.

The failure to respect your opposition is key to that failure to qualify.

Because of MLS and the USL, Jamaica can today fill more than two 23 man squads with nothing but fully professional players, if they so desire - there are well over 50 in the player pool (about 16 in MLS - 20+ in USL).

dpslsc7,t1_dpsjr1j,">But history has some weight here. There is actual superiority in Europe and South America that cannot be denied even if everybody is less shitty these days.

The gap is smaller, which is the point I'm trying to emphasize. Europe and South America have, culturally and historically, decades worth of a head start on the rest of the world. These nations were competing in World Cups (the earliest of which really only featured European and the occasional South American team) before most of the nations in CONCACAF, Africa, and even many parts of Asia **even existed**.

Jamaica became an actual sovereign nation in 1962. It is just over 55 years old. It didn't start seriously competing in football until over 25 years after becoming a country. Football in Europe and South America is just far older than that. These nations were competing in that tournament as early as 1930 - this is over 3 decades before nations like Jamaica even became actual nations. 

To use another example, it is true that African teams aren't yet at the standard seen in CONMEBOL or UEFA. Then again, most African teams didn't exist when CONMEBOL and UEFA began their history in international football. They are playing catch up.

So yes, history is relevant here, but only relevant in a way that adds to my point: the initial gap between UEFA/CONMEBOL and the rest of the world was always going to be huge because they have the longest track record in the game, but it was never going to stay the same size forever. As other regions become increasingly more experienced with decade after decade of competition, it is only fair to expect that they will begin to figure a few more things out, get a little more professional, learn some of the early lessons that CONMEBOL/UEFA teams figured out 80 years ago through trial and error (before the rest of the world's nations existed), build more of a football culture, and start being less shit than everyone thought.

 It's the obvious conclusion - CONMEBOL/UEFA have a historical advantage, but that advantage isn't going to be the same forever and ever amen. It can be narrowed, and we might even live to see the day it disappears altogether.

>i bet you we will be back soon to the US, Mx + random 2 pretty soon, assuming no big CONCACAF changes take place

There is no need to bet on this, it is already guaranteed: once the expanded World Cup comes around in 2026, US + MX will probably never miss out again (at least not any time soon). After expansion, CONCACAF will have 6 automatic qualifiers + a playoff spot. There is a chance US + MX do not always finish 1 + 2 (other teams in the region are good enough to forced them down to 3, 4, or 5) but the odds of both or even just one finishing below 6 are going to be slim.",AthloneRB,,2,2,2017-11-14 06:21:45

The problem with the UEFA qualifiers is the format. People are focusing on Italy and Netherlands not making it. What about the ones that did? Iceland, Poland, Serbia, Croatia, Sweden? Do you think they’d make it in Conmebol? The problem comes when more than 2 good teams are assigned to the same group, and when two good 2nd place teams are matched together. If you look through the ones that don’t make second place on most groups, they’re hardly powerhouses.

Shit on CONCACAF all you like, and you might think, oh wow, 3.5 teams out of 6 make it? That’s the final and fifth round of qualification, CONCACAF has 35 members.

If the UEFA had more previous qualification rounds, where lower tier countries played against each other first, then there could be both less and smaller groups. You could have all the second places play each other, and even some third places.

The point isn’t to underestimate any of those countries, or any individual country for that matter, doing that with CONCACAF was the exact thing I started out complaining about. But the extra rounds of qualification is what CONCACAF does, since the larger teams don’t play each and every island.

The current UEFA system is probably better for the smaller countries, since they get to see their team play against better known stars, so that makes sense too, but the consequence is having too many large groups with only 1 direct qualification spot.",juaydarito,,2,2,2017-11-14 08:37:36

Now, I am *not* saying e.g. Uruguay cannot beat Croatia, or Colombia cannot beat Poland. My point is that the other way is also quite possible and the teams you mentioned wouldn't be exactly outsiders in CONMEBOL either. On the other hand Iceland won a group with Croatia, Ukraine and Turkey, I am not sure a lot of CONMEBOL teams could do that easily.

Other than grossly underestimating the Soviets, who had managed to build T-34 tanks and PPD­40 submachine gun, which were superior to German counterparts, his focus on taking symbolic lands in Ukraine rather than focusing on Moscow cost him the operation dearly. 

Also, the logistics would have been nightmare whether they were in the summer or winter, as Germans at that stage still used horse-drawn carts on the east. Hitler foolishly believed Goring when he said the Airforce could resupply. Whilst on the topic of Goring, he too has a lot of blame on his shoulders. He made too many ambitious promises and had fucked up the development and construction of many projects. In fact, it wasn't till 1944 that Germany even hit full-production and it was then when the Allied were bombing them to bits.  

Had Albert Speer been brought in earlier, Karl Donitz been given permission to start his submarine warfare and production earlier (and the Enigma codes not been cracked) and Hitler not interfering with his generals and scientists ideas, then the course of history would have been much different.

dq2359r,t1_dpshxbx,"Dude it's so much more than that. You've got to be kidding me. We had Fred, Hulk, and Paulinho (who was fucking terrible that WC)... fucking Fred. And his replacement? Jo.

I'm sorry but, yeah we won the Confederations Cup and we did pretty well. But a year later things can be a lot different. Like *a lot* different. And Felipao, instead of assessing everything again like a world class manager should do, decided to ""trust his confed cup winning team"" that won it a WHOLE YEAR AGO. And we never had that much competition. We beat Spain 3-1 and we were like holy shit because they were supposed to be a powerhouse, right? But then we saw in the WC they didn't even leave their group stage and lost to Holland 5-1 which is almost just as bad as us losing 7-1 in the semis if we weren't at home in Brazil.

So no, Neymar and Thiago Silva weren't the only reason we lost. They maybe were the reason we lost 7-1 but we were destined to lose to that Germany team. Just like the original poster here, we scraped by every game and those penalties against Chile were terrible.

This year we have an amazing team and I can't wait to see Germany again on the field. I really can't. It will be a much different game next time and they are not hot shit at all anymore.",omgzpplz,,1,1,2017-11-19 20:18:31

Eye test showed that Shevchenko was obviously playing very well in a tough league, but Henry was still even better.

By having the goalkeeper pass the ball to the shooter before they take a shot, as well as the shooter going over to the goalkeeper after shooting it gives the players a few seconds to interact with each other and get out of their own heads.

e1qohsp,t3_8vvq4x,"England are quite interesting. This side in particular feels like they're trying to break every stereotype about the English style of play, they were very insistent on building up the ball from the back and trying to keep the tempo low. One particular moment comes to mind -- around the 28th minute, after a series of end-to-end attacks, Pickford got the ball, passed it to the center backs, who then passed it slowly and methodically to each other, just so Colombia didn't get momentum going. Kane played a really selfless role as well, he's constantly trying to make decoy runs, and sometime I thought he overdid it -- he'd move so deep he'd be in front of the back three, which didn't make sense. You can tell England are really well-drilled though, Alli, Sterling and Lingard would constantly make runs in support, for example during one of Kane's chances, Alli was in a position ready to tap a possible rebound in. They also had a decent threat from set-pieces, Trippier's delivery is quite delicious. England's back three aren't perfect positionally however, a couple of times I saw a wide gap between the CB and RCB and I think a more direct, left-sided forward could have exploited that, but Colombia played down the right more anyway.

Colombia played more defensively with James out, I wasn't impressed with Carlos Sanchez in the last match but he was better today, constantly played on the front foot and tried to be aggressive and win the ball, was quick and direct with his passing as well. It didn't always work but I liked how he'd try to set up a teammate as soon as possible. The front three was much more fluid today; Cuadrado played more centrally tonight, possibly to provide support to Falcao, and let Arias overlap. I'm not sure it entirely suited him here today, however, he didn't always receive the passes he needed and perhaps playing on the last shoulder, but outside the back three would be better. Quintero got a free role again and I do love seeing him buzz around in midfield, he was left, right and center, wherever the ball was, he was too, and his long passes from deep weren't always accurate, but he was vital to keeping the ball moving for Colombia. His long shots were basically the only goal threat Colombia had initially. 

Normally I don't like talking about the drama and handbags, but it's relevant to the goal today. Colombia were really rash with their fouls sometimes, the bust-up between Henderson and Barrios was just pathetic but that was a warning sign for Colombia -- they couldn't afford to be too rash. Carlos Sanchez shoving Kane down was bloody dumb too. Both sides had tensions boil over when the referee should have tamped it down immediately, and it devolved into shoving and petty fouls. Colombia were worse at this, but hell, England weren't saints either. 

Beyond that, in the second half very little of note happened; Bacca and Muriel came on and provided more support to Falcao, Cuadrado stayed in a wider position and pumped in crosses. Dier came on for Alli and shored up midfield, while Vardy came on to provide a counterattacking threat, but neither Colombia or England could finish the chances they got. It took a moment of magic from Mateus Uribe to win a corner, and Yerry Mina amazingly managed to force extra time with his 3rd goal in 3 games. I do think the corner setup was flawed here, I could be a bit biased but I've always preferred not having anyone on the posts, Atletico-style, think having the two on the posts forward could have been better to cut out the pass into the box. 

England just seemed frayed during extra time, they had Vardy, but he wasn't really involved, and Colombia went much more direct, with Arias, Mojica and Cuadrado all launching crosses into the box. Falcao got a lot more dangerous and could've nicked a goal. Davinson Sanchez and Mina was superb here as well, just put their bodies on the line to defend and block. And the latter had a groin injury!

Penalties were pretty even I thought, Uribe's one was too ambitious though and that let England back into the shootout IMO.

P.S.: I am going to have to watch River Plate after this, Quintero's a really fun player to see. There was one moment where he just told another player to leave the ball for him so he could launch a long pass -- that self-assurance is great.

P.P.S.: As a Gooner, seeing Harry Kane score a penalty against Ospina does not give me the best of feelings <_<

P.P.P.S: Walker doesn't entirely convince me on the ball, he's made mistakes before and another today, on paper he's a good choice for RCB but it just feels like better teams will take advantage of his unfamiliarity there. However, I don't think Sweden will do that so playing him there for now should be fine.",ebilutionist,,851,851,2018-07-03 20:53:29
e1rhi8y,t3_8vvq4x,"Falcao and Colombia now saying American ref Mark Geiger was calling the game in favor of England because he speaks English. LOL!

Gee, maybe actually try to play football instead of resorting to whatever that was before you try that argument. Don’t completely rely on a game plan revolving around playing like talentless goons and then get mad when more fouls are called against you. 

The penalty was absolutely justified. The defender wasn’t even trying to look at the ball. He completely shit his pants when England lined up on that corner, and he performed a perfect form tackle that any NFL linebacker would have been commended for. 

After Geiger made the CORRECT call, let’s spend 10 minutes crying about it. History surely has shown that crying and screaming in the ref’s face usually gets him to change his call... 

During all this bitching, the Colombian players who aren’t in the ref’s face are standing by the penalty spot, using their studs to wreck the grass in hopes that it will cause England to miss. Serious question, has there been a more lame, desperate and pathetic tactic ever used in sports? My god. It’s not even anger-inducing, it’s just sad. 

Then you have the head butt, the bizarre incident with the Colombia coach bumping the England player at half, and just general goonish behavior all game. 

Embarrassing. 

It displays incredible balls to then publicly piss and moan about the referee after all that.

e1r0qtm,t1_e1qzftg,"I mean, America, for starters. There's a HUGE potential market for Soccer in America, but they need to break the stereotype of the crybaby soccer player dropping to the ground at the slightest contact. 

I've learned over the last 8 years or so that I actually enjoy watching soccer games and I get excited about the world cup nowadays. The past few weeks at work have been with a world cup match streaming on my phone as I work. It's been a blast. 

However, I've also gotten seriously frustrated and angered when I see players like Neymar writhing on the ground trying to game the ref into giving them an advantage or Ronaldo screaming his head off at the ref after a call he disagrees with. It just feels dirty, and when I see them succeed in their attempts, it seriously ruins an otherwise good match. It honestly feels like some matches, it's more about who can manipulate the ref into calling fouls against the other team than who's got more skill at the game of soccer. Just awful.

If FIFA could fix those issues, I could see the game's footprint growing considerably in America. The second I see a star player like Neymar stop getting treated with kid gloves and sent off for embellishment, Soccer will have gained a new permanent American fan.

Americans can't take football seriously because \*so many\* of its stars are primadonnas with too much hairspray and too little self respect.

Fix those things and maybe more Americans can be fans. 

I am sceptical real change can come about without solidarity payments, promotion-relegation, and an end to the centrally owned league. As USSF is presently wedded to its WWE-esque ownership structure and insistence on 'student athletes' getting an education before the draft, these seem unlikely to come about without the wholesale

The change wasn't solely him, but the league has been growing in popularity ever since. It's not really at a place to support the second tier of soccer YET. I agree that pro-rel is the future. Money is not there yet though. I think USL will likely keep growing and maybe in a decade we can realistically have that discussion. It's better to take it slow than to set up the leagues for failure.

e1dv05o,t3_8uars2,"Germany came into this match needing to win, but their approach were really lacking -- they felt somewhat neutered and risk-averse. Without Rudy available, and Gündoğan too similar to Kroos, Löw opted for Khedira again. However, he did better today, playing a more reserved role that ensured Kroos and the fullbacks could move forward.

This should have, in theory allowed Germany to be more dynamic and attacking. But their front four seemed disjointed; Özil dropped deep and prompted some long passes forward, Werner moved out wide, but where was the runner looking to receive the former's passes? Where was the target man feeding off the latter's crosses? The starting front four felt like it had pieces to four different puzzles, waiting to be completed. There wasn't a lot of combination play, and when they tried one or the other were always playing on different wavelengths. Gomez and Müller came on again, but it feels like an acknowledgment that the starting tactics had been a mistake, and that they needed more penalty box threats from the start.

And the urgency about Germany's play was horrible as well. If anything, it looked like they were playing a friendly, not a crunch match. They moved the ball too slowly to unsettle South Korea, no quick one-twos, or sudden incisive passes threaded through the defense. Their ball-hogging also minimized the risk of South Korean counterattacks, but was it really necessary against a side just looking to avoid a thrashing?

Ultimately, Germany went out not because of a lack of talent, but because of an indecision in how to use that talent, and this isn't something new. Even back in 2014, Germany took time to adjust their approach before finally settling on an optimal approach; here, they simply weren't given the time. They can have no complaints, a World Cup isn't a place to experiment in.

As for Korea, they were better than against Mexico -- Son wasn't as isolated in the few chances to counter they got, they still maintained their defensive structure well, their keeper was very solid and the one moment they got a point-blank chance, they took it. Otherwise, there isn't much to talk about, and their victory here probably owes more to Germany's anemic play, instead of their own efforts.

All while Brandt was more dangerous in the 15 minutes playtime he had total. Leaving Wagner at home while picking gomez, who did fuck all like forever.

He literally always played like Bayern did. Back when most of them were Bayern players that might have been okay, but those players got fewer and worse.

Need a playmaker, well fuck everyone else I'm going to take Ozil and watch him do absolutely nothing for 60 minutes (I would say 90 but Ozil is always dead tired at 60 minutes even though he only plays one side of the ball and pretty much never runs hard) while guys like Meyer sit at home wondering what they did wrong.",Barack_Drobama,,27,27,2018-06-27 16:43:27

e1e2rne,t1_e1dxwkw,"Most liked him before this world cup I think but mostly because of the 2014 win.  
The 7-1 against a weakened, overrated Brazil is what sticks to memory. The fact we barely got through against Algeria und could have easily lost to France without Neuer sort of gets lost. Overall he has never really done anything but profit from a great generation of German players and his bad lineups (Lahm in midfield 2014 until he was forced to put him back at RB before it cost us dearly) only sometimes got punished (Euros, 2012 especially).    
He got incredibly lucky in 2010 because he could just copy the tactics of a strong Bayern München squad and players like Schweinsteiger, Lahm, Özil, Kedhira, Neuer, Müller approached or reached their peak. He then just kept using the same players and tactics, seeing little success with any deviations and eventually failure when a significant number of those players started underperforming or retired.  
Compared to managers who reached good results with worse players he hasn't done a lot.  

Look at this group:  
Sweden: https://www.transfermarkt.com/schweden/startseite/verein/3557    

Mexico: https://www.transfermarkt.com/jumplist/startseite/verein/6303  

South Korea: https://www.transfermarkt.com/jumplist/startseite/verein/3589  

Germany:  https://www.transfermarkt.com/jumplist/startseite/verein/3262    

Germany has 6 players valued higher than Son who is the highest valued of the other 3 nations.  Germany has 17 players valued above 25 Million which is the next highest player value on those 3 teams combined (Lozano, Lindelöf and Forsberg as well as Germany's Ginter who I didn't count in the 17 German players above this value).  
This is such a massive failure.

Look, let's leave aside Sane, and Wagner, and Lars Bender, and........he brought Kevin fucking Trapp to the World Cup. Of course the 3rd keeper is almost never going to matter on the pitch, but Trapp:

* sucks
* got about as much playing time in the last year for PSG as I did

Is there any better way to send a signal to your players saying ""Don't try! It doesn't matter how or even whether you play.""? And the players got the message loud and clear.

Germany's motto this World Cup might as well have been ""We just don't care. Either it'll be gifted to us on a silver platter, or we'll go out as soon as we hit a hurdle. Either way we already won our trophy four years ago."" and that 100&#37; comes straight from Low's decision-making.",expatbayern,,0,0,2018-06-27 17:40:41

Before the tournament I wrote that Germany could sent a second team that makes the group stage and I still stand by it :) 

You can say that Löw who was never shy to swap players in the past this time relied too much on the 2014 heroes. But mostly the team lacked a leader and did not find a working system. ",UpperHesse,,11,11,2018-06-27 16:52:08

It hurt us during the early games of the 2014 WC, because he would rather fuck up the entire formation than give new blood a chance in midfield. We got very lucky that Schweini and Khedira got fit when they did. Likewise, this tournament he gave way too many chances to Khedira, Müller, Draxler and arguably also Özil and Boateng. It‘s especially infuriating to see certain players (e.g. Brandt, Werner, Reus) perform very well in certain roles once Löw had to try them out of desperation late in the games, yet seeing them being misused or not started at all the following game.",skgoa,,2,2,2018-06-28 11:51:56

Ozil showed up today but didn't really have much support. Mueller plays well but can't hold the team together on his own. I think missing Bastian as captain really hurt us the most, though. People underestimate what a good on-field leader can do for the team, and we watched it at this World Cup. Germany never gelled as a team and no one could get them to pull their shit together for clutch plays. 

I'm glad we lost in group play instead of barely making it to the round of 16 and losing badly to someone there. Better to fade early than die a lingering death. ",profssr-woland,,23,23,2018-06-27 16:49:56
e1e2ahj,t1_e1dz2a6,Missing Bastian AND Lahm. Lahm provided consistency on their wing.

e1e4dpw,t1_e1e3srm,"True, that's where Lahm's defensive prowess comes to place. Fast counters usually starts with fast wings. And with Lahm before, Germany was never threatened on their right side. Both CBs play as cover for Lahm rather than trying to match the pace of the counter. Their left was side was stable too since howedes WC 2014 plays defensively. Doesn't really go forward that often",rappyboy,,3,3,2018-06-27 18:00:50
e1edl4o,t1_e1e2ahj,"Yup, Lahm was a master of shutting down counters, he always seemed to be in the right position to break up a play and he had the pace to match some of the speedier wingers.  Watching Germany this year, with Boateng doing his best David Luiz impression, pulling the defense all out of shape, it was just too easy to see how vulnerable Germany was.

Ironic because in 2010 Germany was one of the only exciting teams to watch in an otherwise lackluster world cup.  Their counterattacking play was devastating, they were young, fast, direct, in 2014 we saw that style mature into a championship, and this world cup we can see it is clearly over-ripe.

If you've been paying attention, ELO rating, rather than something nebulous like reputation, is a much better indicator of how two teams will match up.  From an advanced stats perspective, the only serious shocks were how many goals Russia and England put up against Saudi Arabia and Panama respectively.  Outside of that, there were no major upsets a la Iceland vs England in the 2016 Euros.  Even Mexico's win vs Germany, from an expected ELO outcome perspective was not a major shock - Germany's win probability was only 55%.

Switzerland actually is rated higher than England - ie has a win probability of slightly over 50% against them.  On the flip side, Brazil only has a 56% win probability when matched up vs England.  From an objective standpoint, these teams are all fairly even at this point, and there is no ""easier"" bracket.",asobalife,,-5,-5,2018-06-27 23:27:58

But fine, you want to go off of ELO and “advanced stats” instead of reputation, we can do that and match up each team in their respective slot. Spain has a higher ELO than Uruguay, Portugal has a higher ELO than Russia, France higher than Croatia, Argentina higher than Denmark, Brazil higher than Sweden, Switzerland higher than Mexico, Belgium higher than anyone in Group H, and England higher than anyone in Group H. That’s 5-3 left side, BUT around +50 total ELO for left side. So even using your ridiculous advanced analytical method, the left side is still harder. ",too_drunk_for_this,,4,4,2018-06-28 00:40:00

Just because everyone's *saying* you're the one to beat, doesn't mean you need to prove anything to anyone.

No ones going to give him the space he needs to really turn it on, he's got to get rid of the ball faster and move into whatever space he can find after that.

Holding on to it with three defenders around you and trying to dribble through/around them is just not going to work. Getting the foul is nice but you lose all the momentum everytime you do that unless the FK is by by box and your opponent gets a chance to reset. ",fiver420,,88,88,2018-06-17 20:00:26

Also, Khedira has always played a more defesive role for the NT than at club level and we´ve been fine that way, the problem is rahter the replacement - Gündogan isn´t a defensive minded player as mentioned and if Goretzka can put in some steel if needed at this level has to be seen.

dzq5mai,t3_8mqeor,"Great post overall, just a few things I would personally disagree with:

- I think you're being a bit harsh identifying Kimmich as a point of weakness in the team. While he does have some defensive weaknesses, he's honestly one of the best right backs in the world overall and his defensive weakness is only in comparison to his attacking threat (and is also a symptom of a Bayern system involving highly aggressive full backs). It's a bit like saying Marcelo is a weakness in the Brazil team for having a similar playing style - while it's technically true, it doesn't consider the massive benefits that the playing style brings to the team.

- I think you're overrating Reus a little. He's a wonderful player and I'm genuinely excited to see him finally fit for a major tournament, but saying that he's ""maybe Germany's most talented outfield player"" and ""no one would fancy Sane over Reus"" seems to be exaggeration to me. I think Reus should start (over Oezil, in my personal opinion), but I'm not sure his inclusion in the XI would be quite as obvious as you make it out to be.",,,13,13,2018-05-28 20:45:13

That's the biggest factor to me and maybe some attacking creativity that may be lacking in games to break down teams.

Contrary to 2014, when Khedira and Schweinsteiger made for a pairing strong in defensive skills, Germany now let Kroos play deep often pairing him with another playmaking midfielder like Gündogan or Goretzka.

Can would've been the perfect addition to this squad but since he won't make it, we have to trust in Khedira to make things work. I could see Goretzka doing well as a holding midfielder next to Kroos, but then again that's not up to me to decide.
I also believe that Löw deserves a lot of praise for turning us back into a dominant football nation. He does receive a lot of shit because of favoritism of certain players or questionable experiments (Mustafi, Can, Rudy on RB) but his success is undeniable.

One thing to note is that the team [hired a few Spanish coaches](http://mengnews.joins.com/view.aspx?aid=3046842) as part of the staff, including assistant coach Toni Grande, who was Vicente del Bosque's assistant during that manager's time at Real and Spain.

Since our defense is crap, our best chances of progressing into the knockout rounds is to attack and somehow score more than Germany, Mexico, and Sweden do in our matches. Which will be hard to do since we've been hit with so many injuries (attackers Kwon Chang-hoon, Yeom Ki-hun, and Lee Keun-ho are out, as is defender Kim Min-jae - Kim Jin-su is also a doubt).

Most fellow Korea fans I've spoken to aren't optimistic about our chances in this World Cup, and I agree.

Koreans know this and have been trying to implement a more Spanish approach (*a la Tiki-Taka*) but results have failed.

The fact that Korea’s first match is against Sweden is worrisome. If both countries employ tough aggressive football, the Swedes will undoubtedly dominate. And that is the reason that the injury of Kwon Chang-Hoon, a Dijon winger with 11 goals this season that Koreans hoped would provide a spark of creativity missing in its national team, comes as a fatal blow to our chances.

South Korea usually gets a result in their first game, and considering it's against Sweden, they kind of have to, since their games only get harder from there.


If Sweden assert their physical dominance over them, this could get ugly.

Now it's going to be mulled wine, a fireplace and a crippling ennui over yet another talented England team playing some of the most insipid football around. 

With a 26 man squad to announce, it does give us a little more room for experimentation though. We won't do that, but in theory we could. 

Having said that, I'd be surprised if we don't see largely the squad everyone expects. One silver lining of injuries though, is it means we get further away from Gareth's only RBs dream. 

Would probably take:

GK: Pickford, Ramsdale, Henderson 

RB: TAA, Trippier 

CB: Dier, Stones, Maguire, White, Tomori

LB: Shaw, Chilwell

CM: Bellingham, Rice, Henderson, Phillips

AM: Foden, Mount

W: Saka, Grealish, Sterling, Rashford, Bowen

ST: Kane, Toney, ?

Walker, James

There if performed better: 

Sancho, Maddison, Guehi, Abraham, Gomez

I'm not sure what to expect from England tbh. They did do very well in their last 2 tournaments and they have a ton of talent, but they seem to get worse each match. I'm not considering them one of the out and out favorites like Brazil but Southgate, despite not playing particularly pretty football, has done well enough in tournaments that I wouldn't count them out (to go far, not to win, obviously, it's still England at the end of the day).",lcmrdp,,32,32,2022-10-23 11:43:28

This is often said on /r/soccer but I don't think it's particularly true. Southgate's been perfectly willing to give players a chance in 'easier' games and reward them if they do well. Saka went from being barely making the squad at the start of the Euros, putting in an impressive shift in a dead rubber against the Czechs, and because of that ended up being a key player in the knockouts.

You likely will have the same management first off, and as strange as it sounds you cannot be as motivated as you are the first time around. Managers are praised for any success at all, but sustaining it is so so hard. Whatever motivational tactics you used the first time can not be repeated with the same success. Can you recreate yourself and/or the team again and again? Probably not. But outside there are many teams that are just hungrier and fresher then you can be.

Plus I think a country’s general morale and state of their football governing body can be important, but there is so much drama and nonsense clouding France this year. I think they are in trouble.",DogTheGayFish,,40,40,2022-11-07 15:35:52

Sadly we don't have 3 midfielders. Kante and Pogba are dead, fuck Guendouzi and Rabiot, Camavinga and Tchouameni can double pivot but I don't think the creativity will be there. At this point trying out Dembele as a 10 may not be a terrible idea because at least he can feed Benzema and Mbappe. Coman has been good at RWB for us but he's injury prone, I feel like Clauss can either make or break the team.

Biggest issue is the defense. Kimpembe has a fuck up him, Varane fell off since 2018, Upamecano is hot trash everytime he plays for France, Lucas is injured, and Deschamps don't trust Konate / Mukiele.",,,18,18,2022-11-07 15:36:14

Areola, Lafont, Saliba, Upamecano, Kimpembe, Clauss, Digne, Coman, Y Fofana, Guendouzi, Camavinga, Nkunku, O Dembele, Ben Yedder, Giroud  


I think Giroud, Kamara, and Digne are the biggest doubts. Giroud's place could go to Kolo-Muani or Diaby, Fofana's place could go to Kamara or Veretout, and Digne's could go to Mendy. Hard to say. I think Kamara and Fofana are essentially in a straight shoot-out. Guendouzi will go, though.

The only issue is he and Benzema don't seem to play well together. Sometimes sharing the same space 

I remember in some of the Nations League games, Mbappe would have the ball on the left but there was no one in the middle to link up with or cross to, because both Benz and Antoine drop too deep. Nkunku looked bright when he played.

Midfield took a hard downgrade compared to 2018. No Pogba means France aren't contenders anymore imo. He's far too important. No one else there has his absurd passing range among his other qualities.

Defence is solid except for right side. For some reason Kounde and Upamecano do not look good for France. No Maignan is a miss. Hopefully Lloris is still soild 4 years later.",KryptonianCode,,4,4,2022-11-07 19:39:47
ivgltbi,t3_yopg68,"I am French and I watch all our games. This is my opinion:

I don’t think we are favorites tbh as much as people think we are. We lost Kante and Pogba who are our best two midfielders by far and made Deschamps system tick like clockwork. Do we have talented plays to replace them like Camavinga and Tchouameni? Sure but they haven’t exactly performed at their level so far and not just them. We been playing a 3 at the back system so far and we been struggling tbh. Our defense is the main concern. It looks so vulnerable. And we have so many players that don’t perform for the national team right now like Koundé, Upamecano. Saliba hasn’t been at his best like he is with Arsenal. Konate is injured but I would have loved to have him as his partner. Badashile has been solid so far on his debut game so I’m excited for him. Midfield has no creativity without Guendouzi in it tbh. Hence why we miss Pogba the most. Griezmann is a shadow of his former self so far and Nkunku has performed better but still not quite up to par yet. Hopefully Benzema gets healthy before the World Cup. Also with playing this 3 at the back system we would need Theo Hernandez but for now we have Coman or Rabiot playing there who are alright but not been amazing.

Overall I think we will get out of groups probably but I don’t think we will have a deep run this time and will struggle unfortunately. Mbappé is great but tries too much to do on his own. When he plays with his teammates he can be unstoppable.",ThatFrenchCray,,7,7,2022-11-07 20:41:25

Also Netherlands, one of the likely candidates, should be safe thanks to Mané's injury.

Torino also agreed with Wolfsburg €10m fee to permanently sign him but he suddenly stopped the negotiation probably thinking he was good enough to play for a better team. Consequences:

- No important team tried to sign him in the summer

- Benchwarming at Wolfsburg.

- Not called for the WC 2022.

ivxunx0,t3_ys8ejz,"This is it, favorite time of the year once again. 

Once again we have godlike midfield (top 3 in the world imo, but I am a lot biased) ;).

I would say we even improved defense, we have a lot of young talented players in the back. My only worry is they are still inexperienced, but hopefully it will be ok.

We also changed GK. If enemy has counter, Livaković against anyone 1v1, he is one of the best we can have. However stuff like corners could be problematic.

And now forward. Mandžukić pleaaaaaase come back, I beg you. We are just missing one Halandić to be top team.

Group is not easy, Belgium is top tier team (actually wanted Croatia Belgium final last WC, Modrić vs De Bruyne). So it will be great game that could go either way. Also Morocco and Canada, countries with some great players. Hopefully we should be able to beat them and advance. And in knockout everything is possible.

If you are looking for a dark horse for this WC, Croatia will be it. We are not favorites to win, but no team will have easy time against us. Our midfield alone can carry us, and if everything alligns just right who knows, maybe we can reach the finals again...",MightyJosip,,26,26,2022-11-11 12:40:06

The deepest squad we ever had, wealth of player and tactical options on a level we never had. Both the 2018 and 1998 squads were paper thin with huge dropoffs between the first XI and the subs.

Juranović-Šutalo-Gvardiol-Sosa is a lineup people may not be familiar with now, but it’s almost guranteed they all play for bigger clubs in about a year. That’s why Lovren (who index.hr predict to start 💀) should be nowhere near the field.

Petko is in great form, best since 2019, I could see him start ahead of the other guys. 

For fantasy/betting players, if Pašalić is likely to start, he is a great goalscorer pick. He is actually the player with the most goals for the NT in the last two years, and he always finds himself at the right place at the right time.

Midfield 3 is the best in the world, come at me.

My prediction: A dramatic round of 16 exit, but we’ll play some great football along the way.",,,18,18,2022-11-11 13:35:24

I see that you're just repeating what the article you linked to is telling you, but I feel the need to make a PSA that if someone is having a seizure there is NO need to make sure they don't swallow their tongue, choke on their tongue, anything like that. *Don't stick your hands or other objects into the mouth of someone having a seizure*. Really the only reason you should touch them is to remove them from a dangerous situation, or if a medical professional or 911 operator tell you to. Best case scenario you don't do anything helpful, **worst case scenario you cause them to choke on whatever you put in their mouth and they die**. Your tongue is meant to be inside your mouth! You can't choke on it and your body isn't able to swallow it unless you have some sort of extremely abnormal physiology.

Indeed the stakes of the world cup were huge for France, they had an incredible team, Zidane was blooming into a star player (won the ballon d'or this year) and the expectations and enthusiasm lf the French peiple were huge. 
But there have been many controversies surrounding this WC, and evidence of shady things can be found. Platini confessed 20 years later that they did some shenanigans to arrange the group stage draw so that France would only meet Brazil in the finale if they were both firstof their groups. Petit, who scored the 3rd goal of the finale, has also been suspicious of the whole tournament, and raised the possibility that shady arrangements took place behind the scenes. That is just on top of my head (and to be fair, the world of football is sadly ridden with these scandals), but a lot can be said about this tournament, which was very intense nonetheless.",Imtf_,,38,38,2023-01-12 17:27:48

I hope I will be positively surprised, but I have to admit going out of the group in 2022 would almost feel wrong considering it didn't happen when we actually wanted and expected it.

The team looks way more stable and Piksi has definitely done great with them, but it's a bit of a Serbian DNA thing now to choke good opportunities in major competitions. Mitrovic - Tadic - Vlahovic is on paper one of the best attacking trios in the tournament, I'm looking forward to watching Serbia play.",FlyingArab,,146,146,2022-11-14 12:19:18

iwc6bq2,t3_yux80n,"I'll be completely real here, i am very cautiously optimistic. Just compared to the last WC we have a more mature squad, a better coach (one that can actually motivate players), slightly better midfield, better offence, and the recent successes to motivate us (first in wc qual group above Portugal, first in our NL group above Norway, both after last day wins against those two teams).

Why i'm very cautious about it after all that? Because we here tend to hype up our sports teams a lot and that may backfire. Also, i fear that we are underestimating Cameroon and that they will be hard to win against.

Also, there's a few players i think might be in the starting lineups instead of the 11 mentioned above: S.Mitrovic instead of Veljkovic or Pavlovic, Lazovic instead of Zivkovic and Gudelj instead of Lukic. It might depend a lot on our opponents whether any of those three will start a game since they all have been somewhat regular starters and even important players in the last two years.

All in all, i would be slightly to moderately disappointed if we crash out in the group, depending on the way it happens and i also don't see us going further than the quarter finals at best. But as they say, the ball is round, and anything can happen.",neman-bs,,26,26,2022-11-14 15:44:13

The Serbia vs Switzerland 2018 WC game was one of the most exciting in the tournament (for reasons beyond football). But this time I really think Serbia will get their revenge against Switzerland and qualify for the second round to play one of Portugal or Uruguay. It's a hopeful squad filled with experience and players in their prime and Switzerland are overdue a generational change.",Montuvito_G,,23,23,2022-11-14 15:55:26
iwd0bln,t3_yux80n,"Croatia with an amazing looking defense and shaky offense.

Serbia with an amazing looking offense and shaky defense.

First time in my lifetime seeing this to be honest. It's always been the other way around - we used to have great individual strikers such as Šuker, Pršo, Kranjčar, Olić, Dudu, Mandžukić and our defense was always the weakest link, while the Serbs used to have a stellar defense but lacked in offense. 

The Serb offense this time round is just... incredible... **on paper**. And that's my issue to be honest. On paper Serbia always has an amazing team... and then they'll go and fail the EURO qualifiers for the 7th time in a row... or exit in the group stages at the WC.

I expect Mitrović to be the star player, not Vlahović. I am honestly not convinced by Vlahović so far. Sure, he looked amazing, some people (IMO undeservedly) were even comparing him to Haaland for a little while, but the Juventus move really killed him. I really hope he starts working and he does it fast because Serbia absolutely needs him.

I can **easily** see Serbia making it through this group. Brazil of course is expected to top the group but I can see Serbia taking second place ahead of Switzerland and Cameroon. Switzerland is always dangerous (just ask Italy) but I feel like they're worse than the EUROs. Cameroon just feels... off.

fn3egi8,t3_fz1b0a,"First World Cup final I remember watching was 2002. I think I was supporting Brazil because they were ""the best"" and I thought it would be disgraceful if the country we had battered 5-1 away got their hands on the World Cup instead of the country that knocked England out. I seem to remember Kahn keeping Germany in the game for an hour then throwing it away.

Favourite final would be 2006. The two teams were way more evenly matched than in any of the other finals I've seen and both teams had had incredible journeys to the final. A pretty cagey game all round but still enjoyable and obviously Zidane headbutting Materazzi in extra time spiced up the entire thing. 

Most controversial incident - hard to decide between Zidane's headbutt and De Jong's studs up kick to the chest. I'd probably go with De Jong since he wasn't even sent off. In terms of previous World Cup finals it's probably' Hursts's winning goal.

Best goal I've seen is probably Gotze's. He has very little space and the cross is at a pretty shit height but he chests it up and hits it with his weak foot too quickly for Romero to react. Very audacious attempt and I don't think Romero was expecting it at all. From older World Cups it's got to be Carlos Alberto's in 1970. Winning the ball back, building up from the back, involved almost the entire team, four men get dribbled past and the captain charging in from right back to smash it in. 

Best individual performance probably Materazzi for equalising in the first half, wining Zidane up and converting his pen in the shootout. I feel like out of all the players I've seen at a World Cup he's the one who had the most outsized influence on the result relative to the expectation and the rest of his team. All time probably Maradona in 1986 or Hurst in 1966.

I don't think any of the matches I saw were really upsets. Most of them had the favourites winning and 2006 they were fairly evenly matched although I think France were slight favourites? All time I'd probably say 1950, Brazil had crushed Sweden and Spain in the second group stage while Uruguay scored late goals to get a draw and a narrow win. Brazil were to play an exhibition coronation in front of 200,000 Brazilians packed into the brand new Maracana and all they needed to do was not lose the game.

Edit: Least favourite final probably 2018. After what had been an incredible tournament with tonnes of upsets, comebacks and fairly evenly contested matches France just sort of ran away with it. It was enjoyable watching a team like that play so well but there was no real tension and it was against a clear underdog  who'd played three consecutive 120 minute matches.",twersx,,11,11,2020-04-11 15:31:03

Ribery, Malouda and Henry were all making great runs and Zidane was, well, Zidane. He could make a routine 5 yard pass look beautiful.

But there weren't a whole lot of chances for one reason really; Cannavaro was everywhere. There were several occasions a chance was coming and he just snuffed it out. Thuram at the other end was similarly rock like, but he didn't have to deal with as much.

2006 is my favourite. It was the most entertaining out of all the final's in the 21st century and very even with it being fully in the balance right until the end. Least favourite is 2018, although there was plenty of goals, the match was never really in the balance and France never looked like losing.

England winning in 1966 with a goal that didn't cross the line and another goal that should have been disallowed (people on the pitch)

 **What was the best goal of all time in a World Cup Final?**

The Pele goal against Sweden in, I think 1958.

Probably Pele in that aformentioned 1958 Final.

Even a lot the ""smaller teams"" had at least a few great players like Ukraine, Ivory Coast, Sweden, Ghana, Australia, USA, Czech Republic. I was in tears as a kid after the final. For a number of reasons I was fully invested in France, and especially Zidane. Its always suprised me that that France team weren't really rated before the tournament because they had some fantastic players. Obviously Zidane was at the end of his career but they also had Henry, Makelele, Thuram, Gallas, Abidal, Viera, Malouda.

2018 has to be the best final I saw live, simply because it actually had goals. I really cannot remember much about 2010 and 2014 finals

Biggest upset of all time? Between 1950, 1954 and 1974. In 1950 the Brazillians basically assumed they had already won, 1954 was one of the greatest teams of all time, who were on a huge unbeaten run and had beaten West Germany 8-3 in the groups, 1974 is a similar story, the Dutch and Total Football looked unbeatable until it was.

fn2s7ph,t3_fz1b0a,"> What was the best goal of all time in a World Cup Final?

I genuinely can't look beyond [*that* Götze goal in 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_guXT4I-AQ). It's absolutely astounding!

We're 112 minutes into an extremely tight and heavily fought game that screams ""next goal wins"", but so far both teams contrived to miss their chances. The players are dead on the pitch, which isn't much of a surprise considering the grueling climate and travel they went through during the entire World Cup. Argentina are perfectly happy stopping play at every opportunity just to sneak into penalties, and I reckon Germany would've torn your arm out as well if you offered them that. 

And then it's somehow all turned on its head. The goal stems from slow, ponderous passing in midfield, moving the ball just for the sake of it, trying to regroup and find energy for one last attack, maybe. Kroos plays in Schürrle on the left, only Schürrle is just a few yards past the halfway line, with Götze right in his path down the wing. Schürrle turns, realizes he has a couple yards of space in a completely non-threatening area, and just figures he might as well try to drive a run straight at the defence and see what happens. 

Meanwhile, Götze peels off the wing towards the centre, into the space Schweinsteiger and Müller occupied just a moment earlier. Schürrle absolutely leaves Mascherano in the dust, and the covering Zabaleta is a tad late - allowing Schürrle to half-chip, half-cross the ball into the box, in the back of a horribly out of position Martin Demichelis, and right into Götze's path.

But all that is nothing without the finish. And my god what a finish it is - Götze jumps to take the ball on his chest about eight yards out and so far off to the left of the goal he's not even running into the six yard box, lands, takes a step to chase the ball, now only about three yards away from the line. The angle is tight, Romero's rushing towards him, and yet he twists his body into a strange, diving tackle like shape to volley it past the goalkeeper and into the side netting of the far corner with his weak foot.

The whole game was two teams neutralizing each other on the highest level, and missing the few golden opportunities they were given. But that single moment, with the game on knife's edge, is absolute magic - an absolutely incredible piece of skill right at the moment it was needed the most, on the biggest stage, in the dying moments of a tight game. 

It contains everything that Germany team encompassed that tournament: you've got the even-keeled, self-confident collective of players, who enabled each other to play to their strengths. It's all in that build-up, too: a limping, more dead than alive Schweinsteiger coordinating and rousing his teammates, Lahm skinning Palacio to the point he can only help himself with a tactical foul, the assured passing between Kroos and Schürrle, the decisive turn of pace Schürrle did so well so often, and the outstanding technical ability of Götze.  

Pelé's goal was nothing in comparison, a 3-1 in a resounding and never-in-doubt win. Even Zidane's penalty in 2006 was a much better goal than that - fight me.",sga1,,23,23,2020-04-11 10:33:21
fn2pnbr,t3_fz1b0a,"The first World Cup Final I remember watching was 2002. I loved that Brazil team, and definitely wanted them to win it - despite them knocking England out. They had so much flair, had these amazing yellow shirts with blue shorts, and I always like the team who beat my team to win the whole thing - as it justifies them knocking us out. Have little memory of the final itself, but I remember thinking Ronaldo was the best player ever.

My favourite World Cup Final is hard to say - think in modern times they tend to be a bit dour. Probably 2006, because of all the bare drama - and that's also my vote for the most controversial final I've ever seen. Though the stuff surrounding 1998 with Ronaldo's seizure gives it a lot of off-field controversy, at least. 

Least favourite is probably the Germany-Argentina final in 2014. Boring as hell - my only highlight was that it was a Chelsea player providing as assist for the winning goal.

In terms of biggest upset, the West Germany win over Hungary in 1954 is often purported to be so - as that Hungary team had dominated world football, and were massive favourites.

Another poor player was Coutinho - imo 2nd worst Brazillian today. Yes, he made a great assist, but he also missed a great chance, Lost ball countless times in final third and he was trying really hard to score from outside the box when 3 Belgians were blocking him without 2nd thought

I also feel that ref was really poor and hope not to see him during this WC again. 

Not only he missed penalty/penalties, but also made quite a few medium sized or small mistakes, which could have been impactful - he seemed to forget about cards when he played advantage(Coutinho,Lukaku at least), just straight up didnt give cards for plays which should have been carded(Neymar, Fellaini!!, Fagner), added not enough time.
My favourite decision of his was when Witsel who was holding Fernandinho who was behind him fell and while falling slapped Brazilian in the face and ref gave free kick for Belgium",,,24,24,2018-07-07 16:32:32

They key difference imo was that Belgium showed up improved by adjusting their tactics.

Brazil on the other hand didn't do that. Firminho was heavily outperforming G.Jesus yet he didn't get the starting spot. 

Regarding the higher potential I said earlier, Neymar and especially Coutinho were very underwhelming last night. Even players like Marcelo-Fernandinho-Paulinho, they've proven they usually perform better than that.

e1yfzmy,t3_8wu97n,"Copy pasting my comment from the daily discussion thread

I rewatched some parts of the Brazil-Belgium match yesterday and have come to the conclusion that Martinez outmanaged Tite yesterday. The first thing was Belgium's interesting shape. When Brazil were attacking, Chadli tucked in next to Witsel and marked the space Paulinho usually excels in, which made their defensive shape look something like a 4-4-2 diamond or a Christmas tree depending on where the front three positioned themselves. In attack Chadli always made runs to the wing and Vertonghen dropped back to create a lopsided shape where Chadli's positioning was almost on the same line as Meunier on the right. This created shape that looks sort of like a 3-2-4-1, with the 4 all being fairly wide which allowed Fellaini to have good late runs into the box which overwhelmed the already overwhelmed Fernandinho. Another well executed move by Belgium was doubling up on the wings with both Hazard and Chadli on the left and De Bruyne and Meunier on the right. This worked especially well on Marcelo who didn't receive nearly any support from Neymar, unlike Fagner who received plenty of support by Willian.

The biggest issue in the Brazilian midfield and defence was the space left by Marcelo's forward runs, which is usually covered by Casemiro's clever runs, but yesterday Brazil's defence struggled with both De Bruyne and Meunier dominating him which forced especially Miranda wide very often. Around the 60th minute Belgium's front three started to tire and therefore the only tactic was to just hold on to dear life. With that being said, Brazil should have scored more than once in the second half. A special shout out to Fellaini and Meunier who were absolutely incredible and completely stifled Brazil's amazing Marcelo-Coutinho-Neymar triangle.",FlyingArab,,13,13,2018-07-07 16:30:48

**Some highlights from the legal filing**

It starts off with

>Niemann is a 19-year-old, self-taught chess prodigy. He brings this action to recover from the devastating damages that Defendants have inflicted upon his reputation, career, and life by egregiously defaming him and unlawfully colluding to blacklist him from the profession to which he has dedicated his life.

So you know it's gonna be good.

>Making matters worse for Carlsen, Niemann embarrassed Carlsen by playfully taunting him during his post-match interview. Notorious for his inability to cope with defeat, Carlsen snapped. Enraged that the young Niemann, fully 12 years his junior, dared to disrespect the “King of Chess,” and fearful that the young prodigy would further blemish his multi-million dollar brand by beating him again, Carlsen viciously and maliciously retaliated against Niemann by falsely accusing Niemann, without any evidence, of somehow cheating during their in-person game and demanding that the organizers of the Sinquefield Cup immediately disqualify Niemann from the tournament.

Carlsen is very specifically known for being calm and mature when losing, so I'm not sure where this ""notorious inability"" comes from.

>Unbiased top chess analysts have dissected Niemann and Carlsen’s Sinquefield Cup game in excruciating detail and concluded that Niemann’s victory resulted more from Carlsen’s particularly poor play than Niemann’s particularly exceptional play.

This is absolutely amazing. I'm just basking in it.

>Despite the falsity of Defendants’ accusations, Defendants’ malicious defamation and unlawful collusion has, by design, destroyed Niemann’s remarkable career in its prime and ruined his life  
>  
>Nakamura has also had an acrimonious relationship with Niemann for several years, dating back to when they both worked as streamers for Chess.com and Nakamura viewed Niemann as a threat to his dominance on chess streaming platforms.

Hans, with all kindness, you were never even close to being a threat. You have 61,000 Twitch followers, he has 1.7 million. I'm not even a fan of Hikaru and I know that this is ridiculous.

>By all accounts, Niemann was a massive underdog, particularly given that Carlsen was playing with the white pieces, which afforded Carlsen the distinct competitive advantage of making the first move in the game. Yet, unlike the vast majority of Carlsen’s opponents, Niemann was not intimidated by Carlsen’s stature and did not play for a draw like most would have done. Niemann played to win. He attacked Carlsen early and flipped the advantage to the black pieces, which rattled Carlsen for the remainder of the game. Unnerved by Niemann’s unexpected confidence and early strategic advantage, Carlsen made numerous mistakes upon which Niemann capitalized to secure a tremendous victory over Carlsen, which, by all accounts, should have propelled Niemann’s career to the next level and allowed him to continue realizing his enormous potential as the next great American chess player. Unbeknownst to Niemann at the time, Defendants would do whatever it took ensure that this would never happen.

This reads like someone making their first anime OC for a chess show, and making him the single most overpowered and edgy player ever, while everyone conspires against him, especially his bitter rival (who fans will 100% ship with him). But he will not be overcome by them, because by the ~~heart of the cards~~ beads of the board, he can beat anyone.

Honestly, I'd watch that show.

>As a result of this shocking defeat, Carlsen snapped. Unable to accept the reality of his unexpected loss, Carlsen reflexively retaliated by defaming Niemann to Michael Khodarkovsky, the Executive Director of the Grand Chess Tour, falsely accusing Niemann of cheating during their game and demanding that Niemann be immediately disqualified ... Because Carlsen had absolutely no evidence of Niemann’s cheating, Khodarkovsky refused to comply with Carlsen’s dictatorial command

""Your honor, my client was so fucking awesome at chess that he drove his opponent to madness""

It should go without saying that Khodarkovsky has confirmed that Magnus made no such request.

>After Carlsen succeeded in laying the groundwork against Niemann with his initial defamatory accusations of cheating, he unleashed the full force of his newly-broadened media empire to publicly bolster those allegations and drown out any legitimate sources of opposition that demonstrated why Carlsen’s allegations were untrue

What media empire? The man owns a chess app and has a Twitter account.

>To bolster this unprecedented joint ban, which effectively blacklisted Niemann from professional chess, Nakamura leveraged his platform as Chess.com’s top streamer and credibility as a top chess player to engage in an all-out blitz of defamatory accusations

Well, this is just ridiculous. As we all know, an all out chess blitz can last a *maximum* of ten minutes (as per FIDE regulations), and Hikaru streamed for far longer than that. Honestly, how can a supposed professional know so little about blitz chess?

j7j4hmq,t3_10tin5t,"Great writeup! I'd like to read two more pieces of evidence into the record, if I may.

First, a lot of people speculated that Hans' rating would fall off a cliff after this accusation. The reasoning being that if he was unfairly gaining an edge by cheating, and then was suddenly placed under increased scrutiny that would stop him from continuing to cheat, then his performances would revert back to whatever his true playing strength was.

That hasn't happened. He's had some up and downs, like any player, but in the last few months his average performance rating is pretty much exactly in line with the 2700-rated, top-40-in-the-world level that he was at before the accusation.

Second, in Magnus' most recent tournament, he got off to an uncharacteristically rocky start by his standards. This included his first two-game losing streak since 2015, the second game of which he lost, with the white pieces, to Nodirbek Abdusattorov, another prodigy even younger than Hans with almost exactly the same rating.

Magnus then rebounded and finished in a strong second place. But the picture this paints is of a player who is extremely strong, and still comfortably the best in the world, but who isn't unbeatable to nearly the same degree that he was a few years ago. And the idea that a 2700-rated teenager might just happen to play better than that guy on a given day is actually not that hard to believe.",Quintaton_16,,36,36,2023-02-07 03:56:05

And everyone that ended up sorta being on his side talking in similarly euphemistic term, comes off as rather duplicitous to me. No can really prove anything, but in practice they're still accusing Niemann and Niemann simply lashed out against it.

It feels a lot like political mudslinging before the age of Trump -- you know what they're trying to say, but they're just skirting around it, and it comes off worse than if they're just being upfront, emotional, and human about it.

As someone who was only aware of Magnus as ""that young prodigy"", the narrative after everyone muddied the water, feels picture perfect like what we're taught fictional media (and other e-sport) as the way an entitled top player would response in anger when he lost to a less-favored opponent. It's really a complicated drama with a lot of underlying tension in it, but it's lost in translation because it took so long for everyone to be direct about it.

I think chess as a sport hadn't realized that over-night they became an e-sport and should probably conduct more like an established e-sport does. Particularly with PR, because it's really not a good look when the story takes a life on its own until it gets boiled down to ""top chess player lost to a trash player -- gets angry and accuses him of cheating using buttplug.""

Magnus let's it be known within in camp or just to the suspected leaker(s) that he's going with an unusual opening. When Hans is magically prepped for it, that's a sign he is cheating. It's a little cloak and dagger-y and doesn't jive with the sense given by Hikaru that Magnus has long suspected Hans, but would explain the confidence and steadfastness that Magnus has in the allegation of Hans as a cheater.

One other thing to note (this is what I think OP could have already covered), is that cheating at this level doesn't have to be play Rook to A5.

j7706nc,t3_10tin5t,">(especially since Magnus played white, a major advantage)

This is what's crazy to me about chess. Generally, when you've got some incredibly high level of skill involved in a game like this, where people obsess over it for their entire lives and have careers centered around the game, you can be pretty sure that the game is completely 100% fair for both players. I mean, to pick a similar example in video games, look at Super Smash Bros Melee, a game with nowhere near the history or longevity or in-depth obsessiveness of chess, and all the changes they've made to the way it's played at a competitive level over the last twenty years in order to make sure it is *absolutely perfectly balanced*. Removing items. Limiting the stages to only a tiny fraction of those available. Placing limits on the number of times you're allowed to grab the edge of the stage. And those limitations only continue to get stricter over time to make sure nobody ever has an unfair advantage, no matter how slight.

But chess--the absolute granddaddy of all competitive board games--isn't balanced. This has been known since the 1800s, and all the statistics support it: white will win more often than not. And it's not like this is only a thing at low-level play, either. It actually becomes *more* of an issue when the players are at a higher level, and even more so when computers play against each other. It's genuinely bizarre to me that chess, of all things, is so noticeably unfair for one player.",IHad360K_KarmaDammit,,84,84,2023-02-04 15:48:37

j779ij7,t3_10tin5t,"As someone who reads legal complaints all day to decide on MSJ, MJP, preliminary objections, and other legal nonsense, the Complaint really isn't that remarkable. If anything, the paragraphs should have been broken down further, but I don't work in Missouri, so it's possible that the standard form is just different in Missouri and wherever his attorneys are from (assuming somewhere in the northeast since Niemann is from Connecticut? Massachusetts? Somewhere around there).

What's more telling about the lawsuit is that it hasn't yet been dismissed. It was filed on October 20; preliminary objections or an answer would have needed to be filed by mid-November. Let's assume that POs were filed rather than an answer. A complaint can be thrown out on preliminary objections for a few reasons, the plaintiff can be ordered to amend the complaint, or the objections are denied and the defendants are ordered to answer. Clearly the complaint wasn't thrown out. 

If it was ordered to be amended, that means the amended complaint would have been due a few weeks ago (motion filed mid November, answer due early to mid December (again, unfamiliar with MO's rules, but my jurisdiction is 20 days to respond, so I'm assuming they're somewhere around 20-30, since that's pretty standard in the US), then amended complain due late December to early January (20-30 days again). Then the process repeats. 

If the POs were denied, then the defendants would be ordered to answer the complaint within 20-30 days, so early/mid December. We *have* to assume given public knowledge so far that there will be affirmative defenses/new matter raised in the answer. Niemann's response would be due 20-30 days later, effectively closing the pleadings stage. (If they filed an answer instead of preliminary objections (unlikely but possible), move all the dates forward about a month and a half.) At that point, the defendants' attorneys would be remiss to not file a motion for judgment on the pleadings, if the case is so slam dunk (without seeing exhibits attached to an answer, I'm not buying that it's slam dunk enough for MJP). Eventually, summary judgment motions will be filed, but those will come further down the line after discovery, including depositions like from Ken Regan. It may get tossed on MSJ based on further evidence, like what Regan has to say on the matter, but that's pretty far down the line.

Basically what I'm saying is that the lawsuit is not as much nonsense as you think it is. Is Niemann likely to win? Idk, probably not, but juries can be weird. I've seen cases where it's a slam dunk for one side or the other, and the jury just decides they don't like a lawyer, so they decide for the other side. The fact that Carlson was, as you put it, ""playing middle school games"" over the accusations may not sit right with the jury, especially because it was obvious what he was saying. Niemann's attitude may not sit right with them. The other thing to keep in mind is that it depends on whether the reports of cheating online will even be admissible as evidence, since it's definitely going to be a motion in limine if the case makes it to trial. It's not habit evidence, which is admissible under the federal rules of evidence, as it hasn't occurred frequently enough. It's prior bad acts, which typically aren't admissible evidence when they aren't analogous. Cheating online and cheating OTB are two very different things, and even the report acknowledged that. Only time will tell, but the lawsuit is going to be interesting regardless.",kcvngs76131,,28,28,2023-02-04 16:51:42

j77jjw6,t3_10tin5t,"> One theory suggests that Magnus had heard the cheating rumors about Hans before their game (something Magnus confirmed). As mentioned, chess is a highly mental game, and there is a noted phenomenon where players are worse when they think their opponent has a bot

This is my takeaway as well, there was definitely enough speculation about Hans' suspicious playstyle that Magnus must've been thinking about this whilst playing. Magnus also has been brewing on cheating in chess for a while and after making some judgement errors OTB decided this was the time to save his own ass by accusing Hans.

Magnus definitely has a point about needing more countermeasures but tanked his reputation to prove a point.

One thing I'd say is that compared to us, Korea, Japan, Iran they tend to mentally collpase after conceding a couple and that's when the blow-outs start.

Early into the IvX life cycle they began to hype up that Cyclops had Crossed The Line For Real This Time, that he'd done something he couldn't walk back. In Champions at the time, Amadeus Cho even says he's ""Worse than Hitler."" 

The problem was that, IIRC, Marvel editorial *didn't know* what the Bad Thing in question was. So they spent at least a year hyping up that Cyclops had done something horrible... only for IvX to reveal that no, Cyclops had just resolved the issue of the Inhuman Fart Cloud killing his people, [which was apparently bad enough that Black Bolt murdered him where he stood.](https://comicnewbies.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/blackbolt-kills-cyclops-4.jpg)

Except *not really,* because at the end of the event it was revealed that Scott died as part of the Fart Cloud Genocide and Emma Frost was just making everyone see him using her powers. Then because the writers realized ""Oh wait, Scott and Emma have too good a point,"" Emma goes full genocide against the Inhumans so the story can pretend they're good guys. They also retconned it that Scott's actions destroyed the Fart Cloud rather than just making it not instantly toxic.

ij3arot,t3_wgvgob,"This is, both ironically and unironically, my favorite non-X-Men era of comics. It's so bad it's good(as long as you don't actually read any of the comics). Highlights include:

- Medusa pretending like she didn't already know the terrigen cloud killed mutants, even though it almost killed Quicksilver

- it never being mentioned that at one point terrigen killed humans too? Like with the mutants the retcon is that because of atmosphere mixing the cloud now kills mutants, but no mention of it changing to no longer kill mutants? My head canon? Black bolt didn't know it was gonna change it's effect on humans and was ok with killing us all to get some inhumans.

- Moon Girl trusting Medusa to do the right thing, even though there shouldn't be any debate. And if Medusa had said no, Moon Girl would have become an accomplice to genocide

- Inferno. They tried to make an audience stand in with fire powers. Do you know how many marvel characters control fire? A lot. Like a lot a lot. Inferno is the most boring protag I have ever seen.

- Iso. God I wish she was a mutant. Her design, her powers, even her backstory are more interesting than the inhumans deserve.

- reader. If this man explains how his powers work ONE MORE TIME-

- Synapse from Uncanny Avengers was actually pretty fun. Even if UA low-key made it seem like captain America was ok with genocide(I guess he was hydra cap at the time so he actually was?). Sidenote: Rogue is still the best part of that series, especially the scenes with her doing telepathic defense

- Fucking Medusa sleeping with Human Torch (there's a whole other Perlmutter arc with the FF). And then she dumps him for black bolt as soon as she can???

- speaking of, their relationship isn't terrible, but putting it front and center was a bad idea. They're low-key terrible to each other. Also the scene in IvX when everyone looks up at them and goes: ""Medusa... And Black Bolt... Together. That's beautiful."" Worst writing I have ever seen. Absolutely cringe.

ij2adgu,t3_wgvgob,"Thank you, that was a great read.

Marvel was really cutting their nose to spite their face. They messed with and sidelined one of their consistently best-selling lines because they were angry about having sold the movie rights. I doubt Fox would ever have tried to adapt new material; they were busy doing the Dark Phoenix Saga over and over again.

The Inhumans TV show was such a trainwreck (though I liked Anson Mount). 

I think the X-Men have been toying with setting up their mutant island for quite a few years but it never took before Hickman. Obviously, Magneto had Avalon and Asteroid M decades ago, but as early as after the destruction of Genosha I got the impression that they were trying to do something with a mutant nation. Didn't the actual X-Men also briefly live on Asteroid M/Utopia in the 2010s? Or was that the same thing as Cyclops in Alaska you mentioned?

I'm really late to Hickman's X-Men and don't think it's perfect, but I enjoy that after 50 years, they're trying to do something different with the X-Men, and I think it's an amazing sandbox for creative exploration.",ailathan,,51,51,2022-08-05 15:15:42
ij36ah9,t3_wgvgob,"The would add two things:

Inhumans predate the X-Men. Kirby took what he learned with the Inhumans when creating the X-men. As Stan Lee has said over the years, it was easier to explain why someone had super powers if they were simply born with them. The Inhumans template provided that solution. Making them mutants instead of Inhumans freed them from the continuity baggage of all Inhumans being subjects of the Inhuman kingdom. 

""Secret societies of super individuals were pretty much dime-a-dozen at Marvel"" is no joke. Kirby would do it again and again. The [New Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Evolutionary) were a secret group of Animal People created by the High Evolutionary who learned genetic manipulation form an Inhuman. The Eternals were cosmic Inhumans and their Deviants counter parts were cosmic Mutants. And The formula would be used by other Marvel creators for other groups but the connection is the most obvious between Kirby's Inhumans and X-Men.

Bonus:  
Kirby would take those ideas and do them again over at DC. The New Men became the Animal People in Kamandi and the Eternals were refined into the New Gods. Obviously they are not a 1 to 1 comparison but after how Kirby went from the Inhuman to the X-men you can begin to see how he iterated and improved ideas.",ToasterManDan,,40,40,2022-08-05 18:39:56
ij3evyj,t3_wgvgob,"> It was a baffling event, as both the Inhumans (the guys doing ethnic cleansing) and the X-Men (victims of ethnic cleansing but they’re mean about it) were both treated as having valid arguments. 

To my recollection, it was worse than that because the X-Men said ""I assume the only way to solve this problem is to kill every single Inhuman, and will make absolutely no effort to verify that""

while the Inhumans said ""I assume this development is perfect and good and causes no problems to anyone at all, and will make no effort to verify that, and that the mutants, many of whom I've known and called friend for years, are trying to kill us for absolutely no reason at all""

then every time they met up they just started attacking each other. It was the perfect example of ""A five minute conversation could have avoided all of this"" and relied, as most of these VS. books do, on 
 everyone acting completely out of character to make the conflict work.

And how did it end? Finally someone had that five minute conversation. One of the x-men said ""But the mists are killing mutants!"" and the Inhumans said ""Oh snap, really? Well let's work together to get rid of it"" and that was the end.",sonofaresiii,,41,41,2022-08-05 19:35:13
ij2ppx0,t3_wgvgob,"Iirc they did something similar with the Fantastic Four. They sold the movie rights so they started choking off the comic series. Killed off side series and replaced members with characters they did own like Spider-man. It was more effective then for a number of reasons.

1. The FF series was declining anyway. Sales numbers have been steadily dropping for decades.  The movies being pretty bad probably didn’t help. 

2. They were never as popular as the X-Men. Wolverine alone was more popular. Hell, even Cyclops, Professor X, or Magneto probably have more brand recognition.

>Choosing two out of Ravindra Jadeja/Kuldeep Yadav/Yuzuvendra Chahal

I'd have Kulcha playing together for most games. I believe they perform better when they're playing together. Might give Jadeja a go in the last few games just to see how he goes.

>Should Dhoni bat at 4?

If we lose two wickets inside 10 overs, then I'd trust Dhoni to be the firefighter and pull the team towards recovery more than any other player. A case can be made for Shankar as well, since he's great at rotating the strike and is comfortable against both spinners and pacers. He can be a very effective batsman in the middle overs.

>Choosing one from KL Rahul/Vijay Shankar/Dinesh Karthik

I don't think Rahul should play in the middle order. He gets bogged down a lot in the absence of fielding restrictions and fails to rotate the strike. He can definitely be played as an opener in a couple of games. 

Now it's a toss up between Karthik and Shankar, and honestly I'm content with either of them. Karthik brings in experience and he found some form in later stage of the IPL but, I don't think his game suits the number 4 position. He's good at playing quick cameos in the last 10-15 overs so if he plays, I'd have Dhoni at 4 and Karthik at 5 or even 6.",,,13,13,2019-05-13 14:01:35
enbvr0j,t3_bo33a3,"1. Kulcha have been our biggest strength in the last couple of years, and I wouldn't break them up for whatever little Jadeja provides with the bat.
Bhuvi offers just about the same with the bat if not more, so only play Jadeja in case India want to play Shami and Bumrah.

2. I can't believe people still believe that KL Rahul can 
play in the middle order, he should only get a place in the 11, incase of an injury to either one of Dhawan/Rohit.
So I believe India's starting number 4 is going to be VJ Shankar, in case he shits the bed, India can put Karthik at 4, incase that doesn't work out either, you put Dhoni the crisis man at 4 with Karthik at 6. Karthik has done very well as the finisher.
So that's what I'd do with the middle order in that exact order if nothing works out.

3. I think it's very important that India goes into the WC with a clear plan to utilise Hardik. He can be the difference between 320-odd totals and 370 totals. He's come of age at the right time as well, and has proved he's not just a 26(12)* kind of player anymore.

enbpst3,t3_bo33a3,"> Choosing two out of Ravindra Jadeja/Kuldeep Yadav/Yuzuvendra Chahal.

My XI would be the same as yours to start with. Jadeja should not start, the extra batsman does not seem to be required in a team where Bhuvi plays too (and can perform approximately whatever role Jadeja can with the bat). DK comes in if Shankar proves to be a dud, but DK comes in at 6 or 7 with everyone moving a step ahead.

I hope we do not experiment with the top 3 if there's a tough start. I know Shastri said something a couple months ago, but I hope that's that. We could have experimented in the past but now is not the time.

> Should Dhoni bat at 4?

Not at the start, not unless we absolutely need him to do that because both DK and Shankar fail. Dhoni is a nervy starter and Kohli needs someone who is more confident with him, take singles, etc. If there's a collapse, sure.

I **really** wish we took Pant because with him and Pandya in the team, we had the luxury of sending one of them up the order to take on spin if needed. Pandya will likely be under-utilised because if we punt him at the top of the order and he goes out early, we don't have enough firepower at the end.

> Choosing one from KL Rahul/Vijay Shankar/Dinesh Karthik.

Shankar to start with since they have backed him. DK after him if Shankar isn't able to do much. Rahul last because he hasn't really played too much in the middle order.

Overall, I think our team is pretty well balanced. We have absolutely botched our #4 search though, so now a lot depends on how smartly we utilise our middle order. Each of them has a strength but none of them is a really reliable all-situation player either, so we need to manage that well. Our bowling is top notch, so I'd hope we stop other teams at 320-330 and chase that down.",aazzbb,,15,15,2019-05-13 13:06:01

Group stage is disappointing.

Round of 16 is the objective.

I'm talking about the level we should deliver considering how we played at he AFCON at our best, but from what I see from us recently, I'm not sure we have the level to go through the round of 16.

I know that we can show our best when nobody believe in us, but when we are supposed to at least get a draw, when underperformed badly. One common joke we have regarding this situation is saying that we will loose against Switzerland and Serbia, but for some reason, we'll win against Brazil.

On a more personal note, it's the first time we have a World Cup during school, so it will something new to watch us play with my classmates during dry season. I am used to watch the World Cup at home with family during holiday (on wet season).",MutedBar4,,34,34,2022-11-16 16:57:44

Playoffs make sense from a game perspective because teams can have lopsided strength of schedule, especially the NFL. Often a team will walk into the playoffs on a cupcake schedule and promptly get annihilated by a team with a worse record that had run into better teams in the regular season. That's what happened to the Cowboys last season, and the Cowboys in 2022. That's also why a decent amount of media, fans, etc. picked the Cowboys to lose.

Strength of schedule is not a thing in NASCAR because it's not a 1v1 sport. You're going against everybody every week for a whole season. There's no reason to have playoffs.

That's the whole reason why complaints and discussion about the format have not gone away in 20 years, and this specific format for 10 years, that Big 4 fans don't complain about. Ravens fans weren't telling people to throw out the format last year - they looked unbeatable, but they also never played a defense like the Chiefs, and that's what fan disappointment was concentrated on.

Meanwhile, in NASCAR, we see Larson, Byron, Hamlin, Reddick, etc. outperforming Logano most weeks. There's no comparison.",thejjjordan,,11,11,2024-10-21 16:02:12

lt0lv04,t3_1g8ru5n,you know what props to you for actually backing up your claim instead of just “waaahhh playoffs bad”. I don’t view the playoffs as much outside of the Champion which is a different problem but as long as he doesn’t win it all i’m fine. As far as i’m concerned Harrison Burton is still 35th in points and Logano is still 15th in points unless he wins Phoenix.,grantgruchala12,,67,67,2024-10-21 15:12:23
lt0qn5y,t3_1g8ru5n,"The only way to include DNF's and not have it screw up the results is to sift out DNF's for a driver or team screwup vs. the 'I got collected in the big one' DNF's.  And obviously some of those instances are bound to be subjective instead of objective.

I've never thought that particular variable needed to be included when comparing driver performance.  Also, none of that base data is linked in your analysis either (but I take your word for it lol)",PantherChicken,,12,12,2024-10-21 15:37:56
lt0vxmr,t3_1g8ru5n,"I understand what you mean, but I find your methodology to be pretty useless in regards to comparing years and generations of cars. As you noted, your formula kind of gets trampled when you don't have the same drivers running up front every weekend, and with the unprecedented amount of parity so far this season, you could honestly spin this post as ""More parity in the cup series than ever!"" and make it a positive.

This is a cool way to compare drivers over the course of one season, but is a terrible way to make an assumption that Logano is worse than any other driver from any other season. For example, you don't note that by your data, Ryan Newman (ranked 10th) in 2014, MTJ (ranked 11th) in 2015, and Carl Edwards (ranked 10th) in 2016 are all as bad, if not worse, than Logano when compared to their competition.

It's also maybe not a great idea to include Round of 8 drivers in this methodology when comparing them to *just* Championship 4 drivers over the years. I would assume that Ryan Blaney, for example, probably clears other Round of 8 drivers from the past ten years such as 2022 Chase Briscoe, 2018 Aric Almirola, or even 2023 Chris Buescher after his run of great results.

Not to go full baseball but we need to consider adjusting for eras in regards to things like this. Gen 7 racing is way too different in performance level than at any point in the history of this sport. 

Also maybe reconsider ""Quarterback Rating"" for a NASCAR statistic.",CokeTastesGood39,,11,11,2024-10-21 16:05:31

lt1ximg,t3_1g8ru5n,"1 - As soon as the championship changed to ""win and you are in"" teams changed how they raced.  The reason NASCAR had to add in a bonus for winning the ""regular"" season was because otherwise there was no real advantage to winning after the first one.  MTJ proved this when he maximized stage wins over actual wins and built a huge lead in playoff points.....and won the championship.

2 - For the last few years there has been a consistent trend of Ford teams starting VERY slowly.  They put a ton of effort into Daytona and then basically suck for 8-12 weeks before winning in the second half of the year.  First for win for a Ford this year was race 13.  After that Ford won 7 of 13, 8 of 14 if you include the all star race.  Ford has won 3 of 7 playoff races with Chevy winning the others.  Toyota won 5 of the first 13 and 2 of the last 13 in the regular season.  Zero playoff wins.  Ford correctly deduced that winning in the playoffs had a higher payoff.  

3 - The comparison to stick and ball is inappropriate because in stick and ball a loss is forever.  In NASCAR only a win is forever.  College football is 12 games in the regular season.  If you go 0-11 in the first 11 games and then win the last one it doesnt matter one single bit, you are not getting into the playoffs.  Not so in NASCAR.  See Harrison Burton.  We can argue if that is right or wrong but it is the way the playoffs are structured right now.  Therefore, any metric using stick and ball statistics is useless.  You could win every one of the first 26 races and not even make it to the round of 12.  Look at Harvick in 2020 - clearly the dominate driver all year he missed the Championship 4 because of wrecking and finishing 16th and 17th in the last two races before the final.  Alternately, he missed the final because he finished second in the first race of the round of 4.  Who did he lose to?  Joey Logano.  Who won the Championship? Joey Logano.  If Harvick beats Joey in the first race, wrecking in the next two doesnt matter.  But just that ONE position was the difference between in and out.  Oh and it was the difference TWICE because Harvick missed the cut by...one point.  


Trying to jam the NASCAR championship system into stick and ball statistics is futile.  

No other sport has non playoff contenders ""on the field"" during the playoffs

No other sport has a ""losing doesnt matter"" system

No other sport includes automatic advancement

lt0xbet,t3_1g8ru5n,"Crazy that you put hours of work into this just to mostly receive meme replies (maybe because it’s repetitive for some idk). 

I’ll start this by saying I think Reddick is the driver that most deserves the championship this year. Watched Larson wreck way too many times for it to be anyone else but Reddick. 

I’ll bring up one point I haven’t seen mentioned yet, stage racing. I can’t back it up with numbers (don’t have quick access) but I imagine the only reason logano is still in is due to stage points accumulated throughout the season. *One could argue that Logano would have a higher average finish if he was not chasing stage points on mediocre days.* 

I despise stage racing and stage points. A car that runs 16th-20th all day can sacrifice their finishing position for points that *absolutely make a difference in the playoffs.* I would argue this format heavily favors the top 3 teams, as they are more likely to already be “locked in” to the playoffs and have the leeway to go for stage points. Compared to a team like front row where they need to try to position themselves for a win because the points won’t matter. 

I don’t know why mediocre cars have the chance to gain such a high amount of points through stage racing, it feels disingenuous to the sake of competition. Not really even trying to position yourselves to win the race, just be in x position 60% through the race. But then I remember all the other ludicrous changes this sport has made, and realize they did it because they thought “the fans will find it entertaining”.",TheBigFatToad,,13,13,2024-10-21 16:12:43

It must have taken some time.  My only gripe is the comment about the stick and ball sports and how the best teams in the regular season don’t always win the title. Which is true, but in almost every major sport there’s a best of series between 2 teams to determine the champion. In football, you have 4 quarters to put a team away or make a come back. In NASCAR, you can cut a tire, get wrecked, or blow up and your entire season is over 5 laps into the championship race. Or you can have a 10 second lead and a car not in contention can have an issue or stop on track to cause a caution (looking at you Sammy Smith) and your entire lead is wiped out. Imagine football where at the 2 minute warning it became “next touchdown wins” regardless of what the scoreboard said?",lolhone5tly,,3,3,2024-10-21 16:23:30

lt22p2v,t3_1g8ru5n,"Well NASCAR is a lot more than just a *driver* sport, isn’t it?

Where are the metrics talking about crew chief ability? Pit call success rate? Pit crew average stop time? Pit crew error percentage?

I think a lot of us would prefer a system different than what we have. Hell I’d even settle for this system if they added a 3 race championship round, rather than one race. But they haven’t. So this post just comes off as childish and immature. “Whining” for lack of a better term. 

There’s plenty of seasons in the “old era” where you could argue the best driver didn’t win the championship. 1996 comes to mind when Gordon got beat out by Labonte. Gordon won a ton of races but also DNF’d a lot in the races he didn’t win. Labonte scores more points. 

The point is, the system is the same for everyone. The drivers and teams all play by the same rules. 

Las Vegas, in my opinion, is THE perfect example of why this system IS so great. That was a team win. Joey Logano didn’t win that race. Paul Wolfe won that race. And that’s EXACTLY why you can never count out the 22 team. Joey is a great driver who just rises to the occasion. And Paul is a crew chief who does the same. The moment I heard that Joey was back in, I said he was making it to the Champ 4. They’re too good in these situations. And I knew they would win Vegas. I wasn’t surprised at all. That’s what they do. And that’s what’s great about this system. You come on when it counts and you get rewarded for it. All of the teams have the same ability to do it. 

Remember, Larson was on track to finish what 3rd in points in 2021 until a late caution? His team won him that championship.

gvvhg5f,t3_myfooq,"I'll always remember 2007 for the Orange Box. Even though I didn't even play it till well into 2008 lol. It was right before I really got into PC gaming, and I bought the Orange Box not realizing my computer was too weak to play it at the time, and having no knowledge of how to upgrade. But the next year I finally did and that's when I went back and played a bunch of these famous games that came out this year.

not to mention that the Orange Box blew my mind over a fairly long period of time. Again, being new to PC gaming I literally had never heard of Team Fortress or Half Life before. I only bought the thing because I saw a trailer for Portal somewhere and it blew my mind, (I was really into like 4th dimensional shenanigans and such at the time) and I really wanted it. So I bought and installed all the games on the package just to play portal. And after doing so I felt satisfied with my purchase and I didn't touch the other games for a while. Eventually I tried TF2 and I was surprised how much I loved it and ended up getting way into that for a few hundred hours worth of gameplay. And then after another year or two I finally was like, ""so what's with this half life business then"" and ended up getting obsessed with those games as well. And that's what got me to try out a bunch of other shooters like Bioshock and Mass Effect and so on down the line. 

So like the Orange box wasn't just a one-time ""oh man this is a great deal"" thing for me, it was a fairly extensive part of my introduction to an entire other genre of gaming over the course of several years thanks to how slowly I ended up trying out each of the games on it.",BlazeDrag,,110,110,2021-04-25 23:57:37

gvvc1cn,t3_myfooq,"2007 was the year I really got into videogames. I had played plenty of games prior to that, but mostly just as a thing to pass the time or do when my friends couldn't get together to play (I was born in 1994, so only just turned 13 at the end of that September) or the weather was bad. I had also never really been exposed to PC gaming beyond games like Age of Mythology, Stronghold, the Tycoon games, etc. and had virtually no experience with online multiplayer outside of some Halo 2 stuff while Xbox Live subscription lasted. 

But then 2007 hit and I had games like CoD 4 and Halo 3 for my Xbox which were not only fun to play by myself, but really felt like the turning point for and rise of online console multiplayer. All my friends were playing those games and it was the first time I really got into gaming as a group/communal thing and not just something I did on my own. And my mom also happened to pick up a job at Hollywood Video for some extra money right around this time, so I was able to take advantage of the free game rentals to suddenly start playing games like Bioshock, Assassin's Creed, Mass Effect, and even Rock Band.

And one of the most important ""games"" I got around that time was The Orange Box which introduced me to Valve and really made me more aware of PC gaming and served as my gateway to that side of gaming, aided by Steam which allowed me to explore a nice sized back catalog of PC games I had never been exposed to prior.

It wasn’t even about the games I personally played—I had a PS3 and a Wii, so I didn’t play any of the 360 exclusives until a bit later—but more about the sheer volume of excitement surrounding all these releases. Gaming hasn’t really felt as momentous since.

This was back when G4 was still a thing, so between Attack of the show, X-Play, and their E3 coverage—as well as websites like GameSpot and IGN—I feel like I was being constantly inundated with coverage of all these super exciting new games. The Halo 3 launch was such an insanely huge deal that I even felt the hype despite not being able to play it. Ratchet & Clank Future was a massive graphical leap for probably my favorite franchise at the time, and Uncharted blew my mind with its realistic graphics. I also have fond memories of Crysis: watching the glowing reviews coming in and then getting a physical copy of the game for my birthday. My mom yelled at me because I was so focused on installing the game that I ignored my family.

And Assassin’s Creed? Jesus. People always dunk on the first game—and it definitely doesn’t hold up—but that game absolutely blew my mind. I think it was the first truly open-world game I’d ever played, and it might also have been the first true stealth game I’d ever played. I was just enthralled by the world, and as a 13 year-old kid I thought Altair was the coolest character ever.

And finally, Super Mario Galaxy. What a magical game. To this day I’m not sure any gaming experience has matched the sheer joy of launching that thing for the first time.

Maybe what I really miss is a time in my life where I was so carefree that video games felt like the most important things in it. But still, when I think of my happiest gaming memories, most of them are from 2007.",Pants_for_Bears,,12,12,2021-04-26 03:58:11
gvvp48n,t3_myfooq,"Damn I forgot about Rock Band and Guitar Hero until now. They were *extremely* popular games, where I remember playing them not only at home, but even at some parties in college that I went to. Non-gamers would play them too, particularly Guitar Hero. I still have some specific songs that immediately come into my head from those games--""Mother"" by Danzig. Never heard it before Guitar Hero, and never heard it since. But heard it a fucking lot whenever that game was on!

It's funny to think about how much of a flash in the pan those games were. Super popular cultural icon for a while, and then disappeared.",,,3,3,2021-04-26 01:08:29

The Burning Crusade took everything about WoW and made it better, IMO. I had not one complaint about the game that I can remember, it was such an amazing experience in the raids, the zones, the addition of arena, etc. So much amazing stuff.

Looking back, I had no idea Rock Band would end up being the one I played the most. I also played the crap out of Pokémon: Diamond and Pearl. God of War II is a classic! When Ratchet and Clank and Uncharted came out, I couldn’t decide which of the two to get first and ended up going with Uncharted. Both ended up being amazing! But out of everything that released that year, my absolute favorite was Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions.

gvw632w,t3_myfooq,"2007 is an interesting year for me because it's the year I played so many amazing titles (Halo 3, Mass Effect, Oblivion's expansion, the Witcher, Crackdown, and so on), but it's also the year that I started to witness a significant directional change in the gaming industry, one that would make me lose interest in most modern games. It's when gaming became a culture rather than an escape. More DLCs, more patch fixes, and that year saw an explosion of video game players through Call of Duty. It's the year developers realized the potential in releasing mostly-finished games and saw the rise of microtransactions in abundance, and the year that games started to trend toward more cinematic experiences with flashy eye candy, longer tutorial sections, less player agency, and all that. It was the year that ushered in the sequel-on-sequel formulaic releases, where AAA titles would become very one note because taking risks was too big a concern and became too costly. The year of franchises, where we still see games under the same name that are developed, produced, and released to the public even today.

An excellent year for games, but also the start of a homogenized direction for video games, gaming culture became more important than actual gaming, and gave rise to raw corporatism in the gaming sphere.",icounternonsense,,2,2,2021-04-26 03:52:54

Persona 3 was a 2006 PS2 JP release.  Persona 4 was a 2008 PS2 release.  The 360 had been out for over 3 years at that point.

Wow. That game sucked. I have it still somewhere. Sitting in a forgotten, disappointing box.

I got a launch PS3 from San Francisco, thanks to a friend. I got a 37"" 1080p flatscreen monitor, with low latency.

Playing games in HD!!! Wowie! Blu-Rays!

We could play Tekken online for the first time!

I didn't have to go to the arcade to find quality players.

I played east coast players from my west coast home, in the evening, randomly on any night we wanted.

It was so much fun. We did live chat on IRC or something, with many Tekken Zaibatsu folks.

We also quickly learned that online Tekken was not ""real"" Tekken. Everything was inconsistent, especially movement and whiff punishment. You'd get clipped by something you thought you side stepped. Breaking throws online back then, lol good luck.",MCPtz,,1,1,2021-04-26 04:30:39
