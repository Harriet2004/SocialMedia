jnu4ih3,t3_14721e5,"Russian here. The brain drain has been accelerated by the war for sure, but it has been going on since the 90s. If you look at any leading universities in the world, you will find a lot of top scientists and teachers from Russia or USSR. And the brain drain is getting worse and worse every year, for the following reasons:  


1. Spending. Russia has been consistently cutting the spending on science and education year to year for a while, which apart from low salaries doesn't offer any top-level labs for the scientists to work in
2. Access to worldwide scientific community and conferences. With the war, it's nigh impossible for Russian scientists to travel to other places, attend conferences and participate in discussions. And science is global by nature, being isolationist doesn't work well here.
3. Propaganda. It's slowly starting to get inserted in the curriculum, which most real scientists hate it and want to stay away from it
4. Finally, being declared a foreign agent. This could happen for a myriad of reasons, but one of the worst consequences is that all your materials starts getting marked 18+, meaning that you can't teach school children or young university students anymore. Not to mention that it significantly hinders your attendance or participation in any local Russian scientific events.

> &#039;The main problem in Russia is this: over the past five years only Russia - no other country - has lost so many workers in the scientific field,&#039; said the vice-president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Valentin Parmon, the Interfax news agency reported.

> Experts describe the exodus of scientists from Russia as &#039;concerning&#039; and say it is important to maintain engagement with those remaining in the country to ensure they are not cut off from the global community and that scientific lines of communication remain open.

> A professor of Russian origin, now at a top UK university, who wished to remain anonymous told Chemistry World that this was not the first time significant numbers of scientists had left Russia to pursue opportunities elsewhere.

The Soviet Union was a juggernaut of space exploration, racing neck to neck with the United States throughout the Cold War. After the fall of the USSR, the Russian space agency, Roscosmos (Роскосмос) had to scale back its operations greatly, but still managed to contribute greatly to the International Space Station.

In recent years, it seemed like the Russian space program would be recovering, with missions like Luna 25 - the first Russian probe to be sent to the moon since 1976 - lined up, the Nauka module added to the space station, the Federation / Orel spacecraft to replace Soyuz underway, and Angara A5 finally launching. But, just as they were making all of that forward progress… Putin goes and ruins everything. Because of his hubris and vanity, the Russian space program is dying as many of the most talented Russian scientists and engineers are fleeing the country due to Putin’s insanity. 

While I hate Putin and the commanders of the Russian military, and all of the bloodthirsty vatniks who support this brutal war, I still respect the Russians who do not support the regime, or even outright oppose it.

Meaning it would very well be legal for a Secret Service member to draw a weapon on a sitting president and force them into cuffs, and to call for military police to take them to confinement. And yes, this means actually using the death penalty for treason instead of dancing around it. 

While I don’t think the state should have death penalty power in the vast majority of civilian criminal cases…the office of president should come with a much more severe set of circumstances for stepping out of line. Oh-and expanding the definition of treason should include trying to make the president a king.

ejf1jzz,t3_b5ogg1,"I know this is Russia and not the US, but let's see:

It doesn't say what size pizza or toppings or any of that, but let's just give them the benefit of the doubt and say that it's a large 3-topping pizza which Domino's (currently) charges $7.99 for carryout. That's $799 a year for 100 years, or $79,900 retail cost. I can't find any information on product cost, but I have to assume it's less than half the retail cost - probably even a quarter of the cost. But let's just go half, which is $39,950 cost to Domino's. At 350 winners, this deal would cost them approximately $13.99 million.

So I gotta ask - is it really worth almost $14M to have 350 random Russian people walking around with this logo tattooed? Good deal for the winners, though. I don't think they're living for 100 years, but $79,900 worth of free pizza for probably a $100 tattoo? Winner winner pizza dinner.

First of all, participants are obliged to pay taxes for each ""free"" pizza they order because legally that's an income thus should be taxed. Dominos says that it was the only way to make this possible, but I doubt it. 

Secondly, according to the contract, winners are obliged to verify that they still have the tattoo. It's totally ok and understandable, but during the first verification period Dominos scheduled all the 350 appointments to the 28th of December, the last business day in Russia. Obviously, many participants were unable to make it and therefore lost their contracts. Also, the contract stated that winner must visit Dominos at least 30 times a year (saving receipts), participate in other promotions and advertise Dominoes on their social networks. Otherwise, the contract will be terminated.

But the most hilarious thing is that the orders made with winners' coupons had the lowest priority and sometimes restaurants rejected them due to high load. So, basically, you could waste your free pizza coupon just 'cause you picked the wrong time to make an order.

Russia stole the election in 2016. They tried to in 2018. They'll try again in 2020. Putin's government is hostile, plain and simple. Not just to us, but to Europe as well. 

The problem is that sanctions don't seem to work because Putin has a stranglehold on the Russian government and doesn't give a shit about Russian citizens. 

Even if we had a competent administration, we'd kind of be stuck between a rock and a hard place: do we ramp up military rhetoric against Russia and risk a major war? Do we continue to sit back and play defence, knowing full well that there's very little we can do to prevent election interference peacefully? 

If I was President (and it's a good thing I'm not), I would launch a massive cyberassault on Russia's internet infrastructure and freeze all Russian money in the U.S. in order to cripple the oligarchy.

All of this is being carried out by state legislatures, Secretaries of State, Attorneys General, and Governors the Kochs have contributed to and directed their network of fake grassroots fronts like Americans for Prosperity to campaign for them in elections. Once in office they begin this campaign as well as introduce legislation [written by ALEC](http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/21378/alec_agenda_american_legislative_exchange_council_janus), a 'model legislation' generating body representing the Kochs and other powerful industries, that personally [benefit the Kochs](https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2018/06/19/alec-deadly-asbestos-agenda-benefits-koch-industries/), [labor](https://mic.com/articles/21409/michigan-right-to-work-law-was-the-brainchild-of-alec-the-most-dangerous-group-in-politics#.1oibaPfRX) and industrial and environmental deregulation, tax cuts for the rich which coupled with [supermajority](https://qz.com/1245033/this-koch-brothers-backed-law-stops-states-from-raising-teacher-salaries/) laws is the cause of the drop in education and [rural healthcare](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/25/north-carolina-rural-hospitals-closing-vidant-health) funding, [stack the judiciary](https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2018/07/23/koch-justice-billionaires-expand-influence-law-enforcement-courts-2018/), and gerrymander Congress so their [preferred candidates](http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/21558/koch-brothers-super-pac-janus-unions-midterm-election-americans-prosperity) go into the House.

Now they're doing the same thing nationally. Trumps [Vice President](https://www.thenation.com/article/is-trump-ok/), many [cabinet](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pompeo-draws-liberal-groups-ire/2011/03/10/ABogK33_story.html?utm_term=.3ff6d4b7ff57) and [administration positions](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/30/donald-trump-george-monbiot-misinformation) are staffed with Koch cronies, more are [taking on jobs](https://thinkprogress.org/koch-epa-industry-david-dunlap-chemical-water-1f08cfa2fb01/) in various [regulatory agencies](https://tytnetwork.com/2018/05/24/two-koch-insiders-are-creating-a-new-office-inside-the-fcc/). And [stacking](https://maplight.org/story/dark-money-group-leading-kavanaugh-confirmation-not-authorized-to-operate-in-d-c/) the [federal judiciary](https://www.thenation.com/article/mitch-mcconnell-just-won-the-biggest-battle-yet-in-his-long-war-on-democracy/).

While the Koch network continues apace lobbying for 'right to work' laws, [opposing Public Transit ballots](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/climate/koch-brothers-public-transit.html), tax cuts for the rich that will save the Kochs a billion dollars, and spending 400 million on this years midterms.

They're not done by a long shot. [The Kochs want a Constitutional Convention](https://apnews.com/e84cdca5b568402398eabfcd2b6ada07). They have three items on the agenda for it already:

* Repealing the [17th Amendment](https://www.thenation.com/article/alec-wants-to-to-change-the-way-senators-are-elected-and-take-away-your-vote/) - the right to vote for Senators. It will revert to state appointment. Now think about this for a second: if the state legislature is unrepresentative, and it is gerrymandering Congress, and it is appointing the Senate - what role do you play? There are 32 Republican states, that's 64 Republican Senators. Just three shy of a 2/3 majority.

* Repealing the income tax and estate tax.

* A balanced budget amendment. Both of these will mean Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the ACA, the Department of Education, and all Federal regulatory agencies like the SEC and FDA and EPA and FEC and so on, everything the right have had a bee in their bonnet about since the 1930s will have to be dismantled and shut down or privatised because there will be no means to fund them and they wont be raise taxes or cutting the military budget to do so.

What else would they want added at the convention? With the control they will wield the sky is the limit, I think the [""locks and bolts""](https://np.reddit.com/r/KochWatch/comments/8t0bxy/the_kochpinochet_connection/?st=jjy2ijn7&sh=82088938) against popular organising, against reversing the changes, against the democratic process and enshrining above all else the rights of the propertarian class that James McGill Buchanan, the key inspiration of the Kochs, advised the Pinochet regime on installing in Chiles constitution give a good idea.

The 'supermajority' laws prohibiting raising taxes are one example of the domestic application of ""locks and bolts"". Michigans 'emergency management' law provides another with municipalities having their elected government replaced with something appointed and run for corporate interests which would have tragic and irrevocable results for Flint. It was conceived by the Mackinac Centre - which was co-founded by Joseph P. Overton best known for formulating the 'Overton Window' for advancing unpopular policies one step at a time - and is one of the regional think tanks that coordinates with the Kochs State Policy Network.

In any other country you'd call this a soft coup. 

How do you stop this?

You can't vote them out, the gerrymandering and disenfranchisement ensure their minority has a majority of power. 

You fight this in the court and either they've stacked them or the judges rule in your favour and they just try again and [replace](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/us/north-carolina-republicans-gerrymander-judges-.html) the [judges](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/07/north-carolina-republicans-pass-bill-to-strip-state-supreme-court-candidate-chris-anglin-of-his-gop-affiliation.html) for the next round. If it goes to the federal courts (that they stacked remember) either they rule in [their favour](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/04/republican-voting-rights-supreme-court-id/) or its litigated for so long [the courts declare its too late to change](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/04/politics/north-carolina-court-gerrymander-midterms/index.html). Meaning that a 50.3% electoral result grants them [10 of the 13 Congressional seats](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article221282920.html#storylink=mainstage).

And what a surprise, Michigan AG Bill Schutte [opposed to the ballot initiative](https://www.bridgemi.com/public-sector/driveway-driveway-these-volunteers-aim-end-gerrymandering-michigan) to create an independent body to draw districts, ~~and is running for Governor  is [another Koch Brothers crony](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/07/03/schuette-americans-prosperity-california-donors/755069002/)~~.

While I don't yet know of any Koch connections for Georgia's voter purging Secretary of State running for Governor, [his AG sure is connected](https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2016/10/13/20161013new-attorney-general-in-georgia-formerly-koch-corp-lawyer-and-koch-backed-think-tank-vice-president/).",Lamont-Cranston,,3,3,2018-12-02 12:59:16

*****
> An anonymously run Telegram account has indicated that it wants to sell a tranche of emails relating to Russia&#039;s 2018 World Cup bid, after reports that they contain a dossier compiled by Russian officials on how to bribe Fifa executive council members.

> The email containing the dossier was allegedly sent in March 2010 by Alexander Djordjadze, the head of the Russia 2018 organising committee, nine months before Fifa&#039;s executive council delivered the 2018 tournament to Russia in a secret ballot.

> It is unclear whether the two sets of emails are connected, although BlackMirror said it has emails dated up to 2019, indicating more recent access to Kapkov&#039;s account.

^*noun*

The word tranche is French for 'slice', 'section', 'series', or 'portion', and is a cognate of the English 'trench'. In structured finance, a tranche is one of a number of related securities offered as part of the same transaction. In the financial sense of the word, each bond is a different slice of the deal's risk.",_haha_oh_wow_,,1,1,2019-11-01 18:42:57

The ""collusion narrative"" and ""Russian agent"" talk is it working better than they could ever have imagined.
Don't be their tool. Renounce the ""collusion"" narrative.

We have a process for challenging an election result. There has been NO credible claim that any state or electoral vote outcome was altered by Russian or any other inappropriate influence. Russia spent <50k on social media ads, compared to 81 millions spent by Hillary and Trump (https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/01/russian-facebook-ad-spend/).

Even when the Russians were indicted, it was clearly stated that their actions DID NOT alter the outcome of any election results. https://youtu.be/5rAxiX8Tiu0

The Obama administration said that despite Russian attempts to undermine the presidential election, it has concluded that the results “accurately reflect the will of the American people.”

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/us/politics/hacking-russia-election-fears-barack-obama-donald-trump.html

Rosenstein concurs: 
https://youtu.be/IvuCRIdxi0g?t=343

hzvdet9,t3_t9nt2m,"
u/TheRealDanGordon has provided this detailed explanation:

> German delegates laughed at former President Trump when Trump warned them of becoming dependent on Russia for oil/energy. This dependence has lead to significant turmoil and conflict in the current war in Ukraine, and is increasing energy costs dramatically in Germany and all over the world. In retrospect, Germany's over reliance on Russia for energy was a terrible, terrible idea with big consequences.

This is a pivotal time to transition to other energy sources and we should stop whining about trump and oil money in German politics when people are fucking dying as a result off these conflicts. 

Dozens of countries are already energy independent and they are not invading their neighbors, the idea that codependency keeps us in check is simply obsolete.

Screw the economy, screw heating up the house, cooking with gas and using the car to go to the shopping mall during the weekend.

Intelligence reports seems to suggest that the Russians didn't really have a preferred candidate.  They just wanted to cause chaos and turn Americans against each other and create infighting.  (which certainly has happened). 

But if you talk to individuals, there is a common theory that Russia wanted Trump from the start and did everything in their power to help him win.


If all three of the candidates were democrats, then it would support the latter theory.  If it was mixed, then it would support the former theory.


The article seems to suggest that the three candidates had previous notable government positions.   So that would eliminate people like Trump and Ben Carson.

### 47 floor, double-glazed window 380kg, crane cable burst

^(*Pro-Alpinist.ru* &#40;May 24, 2018&#41;)

> We craned the double-glazed window, the crane was mounted on a roof. The working load of the crane is 500kg, weight of double-glazed window 380kg + 45kg suction cup. From our part, no mistakes were made, the crane was additionally reinforced with loads, we checked and filled up the oil in the gearbox, while inspecting the cable we did not find any damages. The steel-wire cable broke, and caused a lot of damage.  
>  All are alive, no one has suffered. 
At the moment the work is performing under the reconstruction of the destroyed parts of the facade of the building.  
> P.S. Workers suggested to lift the double-glazed window with ropes. Each of rope has a force at rupture 30kN using a system of z-rigs, but this would have been much longer, but much safer.  
> The initiative and instructions to work with a crane did not come from the workers. Therefore, workers will not be financially restore the destruction, the whole burden of responsibility lay with the organizers of this event.

> From the video and article closest to the source; it would appears that the videographer's company specialises in industrial climbing and filming and was hired as part of the ongoing repair-restoration efforts around Moscow.  At this specific work-site the foreman/director refused to allow them to set up the hardware to complete the lift safely, and instructed the workers to use a the cable itself as a pulley.  (Possibly suitable for securing something, but not definitely not moving it safely.) or not to prevent the cables from crossing under tension. ~~Predictably would~~ *This could* have caused the lift to saw through its own cable.

I lack the language ability to find more information that would confirm/disprove this theory.

dtohye5,t3_7uy3cu,"am russian, can confirm.

domestic violence is such a huge problem, it's so deep-rooted, that it is horrendous.

firstly, it's decriminalized to beat for *the first registrated and proven time*. if the woman shows up to the police, the chances are high they will not do anything. **IF** they decide to step in, the husband is fined ~30k (the average monthly pay in some regions is ~23k), and is back to beating her for the fact that she went to the police.

secondly, almost everyone is victim-blaming. it's always the woman's fault for everything that happens to her. if she speaks up, she is condemning herself to endless bullying from her coworkers, her family, his family, even friends.

thirdly, the official murder rate is non-existent. the government does not want the population to know that bad things happen inside the country at all. you will not hear anything on the news. you will not find official statistics anywhere. there are estimates made by organizations that protect people  (which are few and bullied by the government), and they are through the roof.

example: there have been incidents of school attacks by young boys, they have been covered by the TV media in summary of like 1,5 MINUTES. not per channel. AT ALL.

here are some links (sorry, in russian) to back up some of the things i said:

school attacks:

(I'm not discounting this known fact however it's interesting that the issue about women in Russia is not black and white. Russia doesn't hate women, Russia has a violence problem which includes all forms of domestic violence including against children and men, and all forms of homicide across all areas, such that their murder rate is more than twice that of the US.)

Victims om homicides in 2000 were 77% men and 23 percent women (did not find more recent, but let's assume there was not much shift there, make it 25% women).

http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/2012/0535/analit09.php

So, about 2500 women murdered in Russia per year.

Does this film imply 4/5 of murders were by husbands and partners? (To make it ""thousands"" one would need to have at least TWO thousands, right?)

I suppose now it is obvious that this film is a lie.

e1ly0nj,t3_8vb5dn,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Spain's passing game. The tiki taka is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of football knowledge most of the shots will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Russia's nihilistic outlook, which are deftly woven into their strategy - their personal gameplay draws heavily from Trump's ""Build a wall"" speech, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these matches, to realise that they're not just good football matches - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Spain truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Sergio Ramos' existential catchphrase ""hit the ball or the defender"" which itself is a cryptic reference to something. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hierro's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Royal Coat of arms of Spain tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

e1ly0k9,t3_8vb5dn,"Russia played a very basic, but effective game today. Dzyuba was much better today than against Uruguay, he won a lot of balls in the air and generally offered an easy out ball when Russia were under pressure. I can't say I was quite a fan of the swap to a 3-4-2-1, however -- I thought it made them too passive and predictable. Plus, Cheryshev was left on the bench, and it just meant Dzyuba rarely had midfield runners supporting him in attack. Subbing him off when Cheryshev came on was also very odd.

Spain moved the ball well, and while it was generally safe passing, they didn't really need to try and score after the first goal, which owed much to the fullbacks pushing up high -- normally, fullbacks are more cautious when playing against wingbacks, but here the double pivot of Koke and Busquets gave Alba and Nacho the license to roam forward. Honestly, I don't think Russia would have equalized had Pique not left his hand up in the air, they're masters of strangling opposition to death with possession. Isco was also really good, he constantly drifted to the flanks, especially the left, then dribbled into the tight spaces looking to set someone up. Costa wasn't used enough today; he needed more direct balls in, and it's notable that when he *did* get the ball in the box, he'd be able to get a shot off as well. He's such a useful plan B, but Spain not playing to his strengths, means his inclusion can be a little pointless sometimes. Their tempo after going behind was really bad too, it lacked urgency.

After the goal, Russia defended really well, going into a deep block, and forcing Spain into making [passes like this.](https://twitter.com/Reunewal/status/1013447322817171456) Most teams would have gone with plan B, but Spain went with *more* plan A -- Aspas came on to better link up with the forwards, Iniesta came on for a quiet Silva, and Carvajal provided more attacking thrust down the right. Ultimately, it didn't save them from extra time. To put it this way -- [only 5 passes out of 757 made it into the Russian box.](https://twitter.com/othmannerisms/status/1013450395358826496)

Extra-time was more of the same, however Rodrigo Moreno came on to turn Spain into more of a 4-4-2, and while Spain turned the screw here, the Russian backline held firm, and eventually penalties settled it. De Gea was really bad throughout, almost every shot he's faced in this competition ended up being a goal and given his form for Manchester United, it's very surprising. The 2nd Russian penalty was particularly bad, I thought.

Although Russia were really impressive defensively here, this could have been a very boring 1-0 victory had Pique not given away that penalty. They lacked a real counterattacking threat initially -- Dzyuba was more a defensive than offensive option -- and when Cheryshev came on, they were playing far too defensively to use him well. Then again, they made the best of what they were given, and Spain did not.

I have a friend whose really into Fantasy football, he spent weeks choosing his team, comparing players, overthinking everything, reading in the internet. He now has about 50 points.

Meanwhile, I couldn't give a fuck so I just joined their league with an all-Tottenham lineup (+Modric, because I couldn't put more than 3 Englishmen). It was a bad lineup, I have Dembele (who I knew would be a sub) and Son (striker in one of the worst attacks in the WC), but I put them in anyway because I like them.

I have 91 points and I lead their fantasy league. With my joke team put together in 5 minutes. Kane the captain, Eriksen assisting, Modric scoring, clean sheets for Toby & Jan. My friend wants to kill me.",yaniv297,,25,25,2018-06-20 08:07:57

e0mm0c3,t3_8qw4se,"The World Cup, lads...

That special time every four years we turn up to see something amazing.

Some of us wait to see which European team will pick up the gauntlet and backhand Brazil all the way back to South America with their tails between their legs and their fans crying about their team ""being too much like '94"" and not having the ""footballing spirit"" that Nike told them they had in a commercial 16 years ago. 

Some of us wonder aloud as to what side like Cameroon, Bulgaria, Croatia or Ghana will turn up and steal the hearts of the Yankee's who have spent the last few weeks sitting at home trying to elaborate on their link to their great-great-grandfather's dog who happened to be a German Shepherd and as such they are technically 1/16th German. 

Whilst some of us are simply biding our days to see which of our neighboring nations will 'pull a France/Netherlands/Ireland' and completely fall apart in record time due to internal strife. Which, by the way, we do have to give a Special Thank-you to Spain for not even waiting for the Tournament to begin before crumbling to pieces like the Walls of Jericho.

For me though, it's all about what fun new way we will be completely and utterly humiliated.

Tough to top the last few humiliations: Ghost goals (real and imagined)! Physio's being stretchered off the pitch after celebrating a ghost goal (Imagined)! A turgid 0-0 draw against a North African and/or Central American team! EASY! [Sigthorsson!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaW1hqqyEhw)

We've had some crackers over the years, but this time I think we're all going to be humiliated!

Because Lads, It's Coming Home. and when our 'Arry tries to bring his suitcase back through and sets off every metal detector in the world with his Golden size 11 and the gleaming Jules Rimet in the bag, England will have come away with the biggest robbery in Russia since the Perestroika and everyone on this site is going to feel like a right mug when we have the cup.

**Iceland and Nigeria tie:** Iceland *has to beat* Croatia. Tie w/ Croatia means ARG will qualify if they beat Nigeria (4 pts v 3 pts). If NIG beats ARG, tie-break between Iceland and Nigeria at 3 pts (likely goes to Iceland).

**Iceland loses 0-1:** Must-win matchday 3 against Croatia, and if ARG wins it comes down to goal differential. ARG must win by 2 goals to qualify.

I think Iceland have a reasonable chance.  Based on ELO rankings, they're roughly 20 spots ahead of Nigeria (20 something to 40 something) and if they win that & pull out a draw vs Croatia it's quite possible for them to advance.  They qualified directly for the WC over Croatia so they have favorable history!  I just love a good underdog story, but feel free to prove my points wrong lol


**Which powerhouse(s) have the hardest path forward to the elimination stage?**

Italy /s

Actually though definitely Germany.  They likely need two victories & its quite possible Sweden can hold them to a draw via the crowd the box strategy.

Fuck our ungrateful cunt fans who know nothing about football then decide hurl abuse towards a young player forcing him to retire.

But the fact that against MEX we were lazy off the ball and didnt bother to counterpress intensely after we lost the ball was frustrating. It didnt help that Kroos dropped in between the CBs to dictate play while Khedira of all people were allowed to roam forward. The whole point of having Khedira is so he can provide some stability and stay back but he basically played as a no 10 against MEX. If thats the case I rather have Gundogan in there smh. And having Kroos in between the CBs was no help either, he's shown time and time again how weak he is as a sole DM. 

Last WC and Euros, we fortunately had Schweinsteiger who dropped in between the CBs and provided stability. And even then Kroos was still close by him and the two would take turns pushing forward. Whereas against MEX, Khedira ventured forward like he's Messi or something leaving Kroos and the CBs by themselves and at times they both went forward leaving the CBs alone.

The communication between Kroos and Khedira has to be better. Khedira has to stay back for the majority of the game to gain some semblance of a structure. If Low is dumb enough to go all out attack then at least put Gundogan or another attack in cause Khedira is not defending nor doing anything helpful on offense.

I really hope Goretzka replaces Khedira in the lineup but I'm not holding my breath. I could go on and on about this game tbh, there were so many mistakes and the whole game screamed of arrogance and naiveness on the German side.

The match threads have been filled with people that keep complaining about the performances of the world cup teams. What are you guys expecting? The world cup is, with no doubt, the biggest sporting event in the world, but the quality of the matches will never be close to what we see in the champions league.

A national team can call upon the very best players from that nation. A club side can try to sign anybody on the planet. More importantly, the club managers work with their players for nine months out of the year. Repetition builds chemistry, which brings fluidity. Whether it's set plays or tactical schemes or basic movements, there is no substitute for teammates working together four times a week in training and playing together twice a week in games.

Contrast this with a national team coach. What does he get? A couple of days four or five times a season, plus a three-week training camp every other year.

That's why what you get in the Champions League is a proper team. And what you get in the World Cup is a temporary collaboration.

So can we please stop complaining and leave the match threads for actual discussion.",FingerButt99,,23,23,2018-06-15 17:06:45

I used to watch World cup with my mom ALL the time. I'm not at home anymore and she doesn't have cable anymore. 

***Can someone please recommend a service (paid service is fine) that is very easy to use to watch both LIVE matches, AND VOD of the matches in case she has to work during the match / doesn't want to wake up at 5 am?*** I assume she will watch on her macbook laptop. (in us) [English]

I heard good things about fubo.tv? I don't mind buying a month if it means it will be easy for her to watch. 

I understand there are certain websites where she can watch for free. But she's not the most tech savvy, and I don't  want to send her to ad-filled sites with pop-ups, and she doesn't know how to use ACE Player.

e0t7vi0,t3_8qw4se,I've been thinking a little about the KSA-RUS game and I've come to the conclusion that the Russian coach nailed his tactics. It was clear the Saudis were not comfortable in possession and the Russians sat back and waited for an error in the mid-third before launching devastating counters. I actually would expect KSA to do better against a Uruguay type side because Uruguay will dominate possession and the Saudis can sit in a low block and defend. Not saying they'll get a result (Uruguay should still win fairly comfortably) but I don't think they'll look as poor. The Russian coach knew that the Saudis would have no idea how to break down a compact and low sitting defence and therefore he set them up to play on the counter.

e13ytht,t3_8qw4se,"To people with stable jobs: how much do you enjoy World Cup or European Championship, Copa America etc? How many games can you catch?

Maybe I'm a little bit too obsessed but the thought of being unable to watch many games in such a tournament gets me very anxious about the future. Currently I both study and work but both my jobs are online and relatively flexible - so waking up early, putting a 6hr shift, then watching three games one after another (and keep working between the games for an hour if necessary) works well. However, I know I won't be that lucky in the long run, when I will have to spend summer looking for an internship position or working in a full-time position that requires leaving home.

I'm thinking of using all my days off for one-month period but here in my country you are lucky to have 30 days off in a year, especially if you've just started working - so this might be too optimistic. How do you guys cope with it? I'm 24, by the way. ""Huh, when you're 30 with two kids and a full-time job, you don't really give a fuck about what Panama does against Tunisia - just catch whatever you can in the evening and you'll do fine"" or any other similar response would relieve my stress. On the other hand, I may burst into tears, going, ""So you say that I will not care about WC in 6 years? Then what's the point of being alive when you don't even get excited for WC?""

In general I'm not that crazy but I have a soft spot for European Championship and World Cup for obvious reasons - they're held every fourth year and basically miraculous things. We wait 47 months for this and in best case scenario, we can enjoy 15 or so of them in our lifetime. I'm not a lazy fuck - I love working and I know how important it is to stay in shape both physically and mentally, especially having spent years lying on the couch. But please, let me take a break every four year for a whole month - just let me stay at home and watch ALL GAMES in peace.

Can any of you guys do that while working a full-time job? What's your secret?",Rigelmeister,,11,11,2018-06-22 14:34:04

e1zqoa9,t3_8wzc6y,"Such a frustrating game to watch. We played the same kind of football we always do: *""We're just trying to stay in this tournament for as many more minutes as possible!""* That's Swedish football. Always risk-averse, always fighting to not lose instead of fighting to win. Even when behind, the Swedish team simply *will not* take risks.

That's why I knew it was over when England scored the first goal. Sweden doesn't know how to win from behind, they don't know how to make a comeback. Either we take the lead early and turtle up, in which case we win, or we lose the lead early and *still* turtle up, still keep on playing as if we were ahead.

By having the goalkeeper pass the ball to the shooter before they take a shot, as well as the shooter going over to the goalkeeper after shooting it gives the players a few seconds to interact with each other and get out of their own heads. I think it's a fantastic change to the usual grim fear inducing process.

dtvwgwu,t3_7vvo4y,"This is bad news. However I also believe it could be a directive from the WH or GOP as a way to depress Democrat turnout.  
  
I'm noticing a lot of fatalism from supposedly liberal accounts saying nothing the Dems do will work because the Russians will rig it anyway. I notice these tend to be younger accounts and reek of concern trolling. Yes, the Russians will likely continue measures. However, the way midterms are set up don't allow for much overt factors they could potentially change.  
  
So a big fear is purging voter rolls or inactive voters, right? That
something GOP officials in states can and could do long before Russia was part of the equation. The other fear is swaying voters via social media targeted with metadata. While possible, the midterms are difficult to impact because there's not a pool of ~80,000 voters to influence to swing one single electoral college election like 2016.  
  
So to truly make a major impact against what's seen as an incoming blue tsunami, it would take an unprecedented amount of coordination and active agents to maintain a GOP House. Maybe impact the Senate, but the House is actually more important in terms of curtailing Trump and his lackies in the House.  
  
By the way House seats are set up, this would require agents working in individual county boards of elections in obscure and rural areas. And will the Russians *really* plant an operative in Wilkes or Surry County, NC just to make sure someone like Virginia Foxx stays in office? Imagine the amount of communications that'd be required for Russians to compromise a vote like that. I really doubt that could be pulled off unless the Feds are already aware of it and setting a trap or something.  
  
Outside of the continued, already exposed Russian manipulation of social media, what else can they do to influence the results of a midterm? Midterms are so de-centralized that again the sheer scale of coordination required seems way to overt to not already be caught or prevented at this point. ",,,1,1,2018-02-07 17:36:55

This was originally posted in /r/KendrickLamar several days ago, and you can find the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/comments/1cm2ibf/drake_has_clear_predatory_behavior_towards_minors/).

___

I've added several new points to the unconfirmed rumors:

- Post about Drake getting aggressive with photographer after he snaps a pic of Drake + 2 young women exiting his/a helicopter

- A post insinuating that Drake requested nudes from his 18 year old date and her friends, without knowing whether or not they were of age

- A post insinuating that a minor was topless in Drake's dressing room

- A post about Drake possibly being connected to the porn-site Net Video Girls. This one is strange as fuck.

- The video of UK rapper Potter Payper calling out Drake for messaging young girls in England.

- Added the $530K settlement

- Added the big thread about CDAN - really worth a read, although questionable reputation.

- Added the comment regarding the model and dogbowls.

- Added the interview with Aya not being able to speak about sex with Drake because of 'court'.

____

New additions:

- Added more to the Bella Harris section including her dad's 'response' with the like on IG, because it led me to an old [StarTribune article](https://www.startribune.com/jimmy-jam-s-daughter-s-an-anti-kardashian/303679711/?refresh=true) where her mother is saying questionable things. 

- Removed the Lil CC section from unconfirmed rumors, as it was just repeated information.

- Added the Twitter video of the guy explaining his high school experience in regards to girls and Drake

___

More:

- Added Baka Not Nice under ties
- Added Adel 'Future' Nur under ties
- Added more information about the $350.000 settlement. Drake sued her for defamation, extortion etc. first, yet ended up paying her 350K? Hmm.
- Added a section about CDaN reputation under final notes
- Cleaned up the post a bit + some reformatting

___

Even more: 

- Added Shaye G's allegations
- Added ties to J Mulan who allegedly does trafficking for Drake and other celebrities
- Added ties to DJ Eric who also allegedly does trafficking for Drake

___

For the record:
 
I get a lot of DMs with people sending me stuff, and that's cool - but it has to be verifiable and sourced. I can't just post random screenshots because it ruins the credibility of the entire post. That's also why there's plenty of disclaimers throughout, there's an entire section for unconfirmed rumors and I specifically have a section regarding CDaN.

The same goes with the Omertá stuff. There's no doubt it's shady and something might be going on, but I can't include it in the post until there's more verifiably sourced information.

___ 

More: 

- Added the TikTok 'investigation' that's been done by 51bworld in these two videos - [1](https://www.tiktok.com/@51bworld/video/7365487401369750826?_r=1&_t=8mB1AUJTFxW) and [2](https://www.tiktok.com/@51bworld/video/7366024091083623726?_r=1&_t=8mB0gw1LOk2).

- Added an overview at the top of the post

___

More: 

- Added Drake's age at each section regarding the celebrity girls as requested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1co5vrl/drake_has_a_clear_pattern_of_predatory_behavior/l3cfy9a/).

___

Final edit: 

This has gotten to the point where I get spammed with Reddit Care notifications and constant DMs with people providing new info, or wanna argue why I'm wrong and that Drake is completely innocent. You can believe whatever you want - I have presented my case and if you disagree, that's fine.

I personally do not believe that there can be this amount of smoke without fire and to everyone of you who claim I don't care about the girls, but just want to see Drake burn - that's projection my friends. You don't know me, what I do or what I stand for. 

And let me just set this straight: People complain about me adding a YouTube comment claiming that's dismissible. Sure, you can think that, but it just proves to everyone that you didn't read the entire post. This post is to prove the **pattern** of behavior. I know that can be difficult concept to grasp, even though I've explained it several times in the post. 

If you saw the amount of screenshots of comments I have in my DMs your mind would be blown, but because I actually try to make a credible post with links to sources I did not include them. I could easily have added 50 more points to the unconfirmed rumors with all kinds of claims, but it's extremely time consuming to source everything and then write it into the post. It's never good enough for people like you, but that's not my problem - that's a you-issue - stop being a debate pervert. 

I've also received comments and DMs saying that I hope Drake actually did something to these girls. I only have one response to that: Go fuck yourself. 

I will abandon this account and there won't be anymore updates to this post. As I've written in the OP, you are free to take this entire post and do whatever you want with it. No credit needed, I do not care.

One thing that’s been exposed in this rap battle is the use of faux concern for women and girls by the same people that have worked with rapists and abusers for many years. Kendrick featured Kodak Black on his album AFTER he was convicted for rape. Metro Boomin was just exposed for having countless tweets regarding his desire for underage girls and his desire to abuse girls.

I read it all. Do I think Drake, like Leo, prefers young women? Sure seems like it. Is there something inherently problematic with that? There are several different somethings.

Has what you’ve presented shown or strongly supported the position that “Drake is a pedophile”? No. “Drake is a groomer”? Not really.

Is he a selfish man who has enjoyed and exploited his money and celebrity to collect/use/fuck young women? 100%. Is Drake a *predator*? imo only if you strip too much agency from some of these women and “connect all the dots yourself” (the Aliyah tie-in was wild) with the others.

You made a ton of really great points and the possible correlation between From and the real history of the Beothuk people. I always felt that our history on Beothuk people has been criminally underrepresented. It’s fascinating how those people (the real people to “discover” Newfoundland) were actually able to survive and thrive here before being killed off. 
I would be over the moon to discover that your theory is actually correct and truly based on this.

jo80efk,t3_13w7cik,"I love your theory! I have to admit I am biased because it's very similar to what I thought was going on (without this level of detail of course). One thing that might help I think, is the melody. I've seen people associating it with specific characters because they touched, they broke and they stole. But I thought it was very similar to descriptions of what happened to native american people and the Beothuk people. As in, the colonizers that came touched (might have to do with r-word, or how they touched people/spread diseases that the Beothuk people had no natural resistance to), they broke (possibly the active killing of their people or the destroying their settlements) and they stole (which in my opinion is clearly connected with them kidnapping people, and even specifically children). 

Also seeing as some people from this show have worked on LOST, the possibility of game between ""Good"" and ""Evil"" is further evidenced. I think this show has clues that demonstrate the similarities with Lost. Even the fact the showrunners have hinted at the people in From being connected by something. 

Everything else you pointed out is so compelling as well. There were  many times I wondered ""Why would they point this out in this scene?"" / ""Why would they focus on this in this specific shot?"", as I was taught that when filmmakers focus on specific items that have no apparent significance, they must have a meaning. For example with Boyd, I believe you see the dog that one time, and then never see it again. It would be extremely telling if the intention were to show Boyd as the ''fool'' card.  


The ship being called Matthew and the area where they arrive beind called Boyd's Cove is also just too much of a coincidence. 

I had thought of something around the Beothuk people, newfoundland and the various trips made there, however what stumped me many times was the fact that the show was filmed in America and the fromvill residents are also American and they were taken from american areas. If this theory is correct, I wonder if they'll explain that or if it's a ""well it's an american show so... we picked an american location.""  


Anyway, I love this theory, there is so much detail and clearly some time put into it. Although I would say I think the talismans are Nordic runes. They are so eerily similar to runes I've seen, I don't think they are Beothuk symbols. Would also make sense seeing as Vikings were the first ones to have contact with the natives in Newfoundland and they supposedly had a bad confrontation with the Beothuk, which left the Beothuk apprehensive about following visits from outsiders.  


I really hope either your theory turns out to be it, or it's something very similar as it would continue the eerie supernatural vibes to this show. So far I've really disliked the alien and government theories, as well as thinking they really wouldn't explain anything.  


Good work man!",Moon-Cookies,,4,4,2023-06-15 13:08:39

jmnxo61,t3_13w7cik,"Whew, boy. There is a \*lot\* of speculation going on in here that I'm not sure that the facts can support. That said, there's \*also\* a lot of speculation in here that is really interesting, and I love. Which seems to always be the case for me, with your theories, lol

Personally, the parts that I think are the strongest are the parts that connect it to American history, because when you have a show like this where the phenomenon only happens in one place, you have to ask: why just that one place?

In my mind, there are two options:

1. To make it easy for the writers and actors, so that they don't have to deal with language/cultural barriers
2. The location is extremely significant to the narrative

And that's the whole list, imo. And there are a few things in the source that support option 2 over option 1. So \*if\* the location (aka, America) is significant, then we have to ask why. Colonization seems like a decent option. Personally, I've been wondering if at some point they're going to tie this in to the colony of Roanoke.

That said, this phenomenon appears to pre-date the formation of the United States, and yet only seems to target people within its modern borders, which is extremely curious, and points me toward option 1. Further, the timelines just don't add up, for me, and may point toward something else.

So at this point, I'm not willing to totally commit to the idea that this involves Native culture or deities, but I do think it's a real possibility.

I'm also not willing to commit to a theory based on an existing structure like the tarot, because I think the writers will likely want to carve out their own niche and mythology. I suspect that the end result will incorporate elements from many different cultures, though, possibly including the tarot. Many folks like to spend time trying to fit the lore of the show into a pre-existing mold around existing lore, like the tarot, or the fae, or what-have-you. But from a show-making perspective, I don't think that this is the kind of show that has neat delineations like that, because they're going to want to keep us guessing for the whole run of the show.

All of that said, I do believe that there was an inciting incident involving something \*like\* colonizers invading a sacred Native space and either intentionally or unintentionally creating this situation. Perhaps it's even pre-humanity, some creature from space that's been sleeping on Earth for millennia, or an antediluvian being of some sort that the Native peoples knew to avoid.

We don’t know how many people are in town in the beginning, but there appears to consistently be an equal number of deaths and arrivals. 

In Season 1, episodes 1 &2, five people die (i.e., mother/girl, three in the clinic) and five people “arrive” or have joined the community (i.e., the Matthews family & Jade).

From that point onwards, Nathan, the drunk in the box, and the priest die and there are 14 “losses” (as mentioned by Donna) at Community house. Not sure if I’ve missed any further deaths in Season 1. That’s 17 total deaths, which means 17 cards (people) must be replaced. 

Season 1 ends and season 2 opens with approximately 20-25 (Eldgin’s estimate) arrivals. A few of those arrivals and the bartender die in the first two episodes. The deaths:
- (2) Old couple on bus
- (2) Stuck under the house w/Jim (includes bartender) 
- (2) Caught on street
- (2) Young couple hiding in bar

If there were 25 on the bus, eight deaths would mean 17 more people joined the community to replace the folks in Season 1.",,,3,3,2023-12-16 22:51:24

jn0tawn,t3_13w7cik,"Let me start by saying I love this theory, especially because it ties in the Norse runes nicely and the upside down/mirror references so well. I’m responding late, but I have questions!

Can you talk about the showrunners renovating the set? Or changing it? What did they change?

Why is the mirror world the civil war? I guess the answer could be=because that’s what Jade saw, but why couldn’t the mirror world be any of the other times/years shown? Or other times Jade has seen? Certainly the ventriloquist dummy is from a different era (yes they had them in the 1860s but they look different). If there’s a reversed version of everyone, why wouldn’t the alternate world be in the present day with reversed versions of everyone?

I think the crows on the daytime portion of father khatri’s sash make sense considering that’s the only time we ever see them. Maybe it’s less of a “Sun versus moon” sash indicating who’s on which side, and more of a “this is how life is” sash.

Do both the witch and the Beothuk Deity(BD) trade off controlling the diner jukebox?

Why would killing Ethan mean BD wins and everyone can just go home? Was he just lying to Sarah? 

Along the same lines, What happens if BD wins? I guess the witch doesn’t get to see her kid? What happens if the witch wins? Doesn’t look all that great for the “players” either way….

Is there a reason you decided on tarot cards as opposed to a card game?

Thanks for posting this. It’s a great read!

Ankouee looks close to Ankou (Breton: /ɑːnkuː/ an Ankoù) is a servant of death in Breton, Cornish (an Ankow in Cornish), Welsh (yr Angau in Welsh) and Norman French folklore. personified as a skeleton with a scythe or spear especially in the mythology of Brittany, France. Sounds like the grim reaper. Surely it cant be a coincidence lol  
  
""Ankou y"" = 'Death Here' in french maybe?? i don't speak French sadly. It sounds exactly like what the kids are saying when you put it in google translate.  
  
I also agree with someone else who posted the monsters were Sluagh. Which could mean they are connected with the crows, by bringing them to the town which could be a middle ground between life and death.

jnv3cii,t3_13w7cik,">From Theory Updated - A game of Tarot between an accused witch and a Beothuk deity in Newfoundland during John Cabot's lost expedition of 1498

So reading about Cabot your dates are out.

Cabot returned 1500 as there is evidence of one his crew living in London in 1501. Plus Spanish maps showing Newfoundland, dated 1500, had areas marked discovered by the British. 

So there is no way he was there in 1506

The whole tale about witches, pregnant women and such is exactly that. A tale.

Almost nothing is known about Cabot's third and final voyage of 1498.

There is nothing about the crew suffering starvation, cutting tongues out etc (and we've seen nothing about said ships or a colony. 

And the myth of a witch play tarot with a demon is definitely very much undocumented and lacking of evidence. People having packs of cards and playing them is coincidences. If they had tarot cards then for sure that would be something. Jade, having a deck of cards as a programmer/physicist (a shit one) and a mathematician would not be unusual. 

Of course shows can and do take creative licence with such matters, and the casual link between the characters clothing and nature's with tarot seems to be a possibility

However on reading about Boyd his character, outside of holding knapsacks in a bundle as opposed to the handle seems tenuous.

For example the Fool's attributes are:

Upright: innocence, new beginnings, free spirit Reversed: recklessness, taken advantage of, inconsideration

https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/tarot-card-meanings-list

I've yet to see Boyd show any of these. He is the opposite of a free spirit and is no bodies fool.

That said Ellis and Fatima are so clearly the lovers whst the tower is well the tower. But Tom being justice? Huh nothing he did or said suggests:

Upright: cause and effect, clarity, truth Reversed: dishonesty, unaccountability, unfairness

Ethan is not a magican/wizard as he does not show much less, to borrow a term, manifest any of these attributes:

Upright: willpower, desire, creation, manifestation Reversed: trickery, illusions, out of touch

To be frank I hope that From is not a Faustian like game. In fact I was hoping for a 1899 type story, trapped in a AI controlled world designed and built by Jade to keep powerful demons (malwatre viruses, rouge AI's) imprisoned). The people trapped in the simulation are there to keep the monsters busy and focused on playing with their meals then trying to break out. 

Jade  is thrown in the world by the backers to ensure the maze/prison he has created is impossible to break out of (who better to test the prison then the designer). Jim and Tabitha are engineers who worked on it. Probably cast in because the prison is beyond its stated purpose (because power corrupts). There are so many blanks in the story. What did Tabitha do in RL, what did Donna and Kenny do? 

Probably why Toby was executed, who's murder was hidden by Sara allowing the monsters to enter the clinic, because they realised the knock on his noggin was possibly going to dislodge the memory block. 

Because really this world only has two explanations for its reality.

It's magical or computer generated.

If it's magical then that would be a shame. Tarot cards and demons annoy me to no end. 

It always seems to be the case whenever you find a point of order with these fantasy's one can always pull out of your ass another take. 

Like tarot cards. Seems to be a new meaning for these cards no matter the situation. Oh Boyd is the fool because he has curly hair and the cards from blah 
Blah obscure pack have the fool with black curly hair who shoots his wife. 

Sigh. 

Anyway considering how convoluted and silly Lost (just reading the Synopsis was made me glad I hadn't wasted my time on this pile of crap) was your explanation is probably true. 

What a shame.",verbmegoinghere,,3,3,2023-06-12 04:02:03

My point is it's way too early to come up with such an intricate theory, based on the limited information we have so far. This show could end up having just 4 seasons or ....14 and at this point literally half the theories presented here could be half-right. Your theory although an interesting read, feels oddly specific, nobody even knows half the things you mentioned just in the title, no producer/s would ever create a show with a plotline so complicated that it only caters to like 0.1% of people either obsessed with details and/or extremely familiar with indigenous lore...

Can I ask, how much of that Beothuk story is actual documented history and how much is myth?

Does this theory allow them to keep adding characters without some big reset? So far this is kind of following the LOST pattern of adding a bunch of new characters each season.

Also, are there any specific bold predictions you can make based on the theory? You do mention reverse tarots and people tied to the same objects.",Upbeat-Department-43,,1,1,2023-06-20 23:40:34

There is not a clear favourite but my guts is telling me than Italy will win.

As somebody who came into Cabin Pressure a year or two ago - recommended by a colleague, neither of us being Cumberbatch fans - it's a show that I've returned to regularly to laugh at all over again. I had no idea that Sherlock fans became so crazy about it, purely because I never thought about that before now.

He was VERY nice about it but I'm pretty sure he thought I was nuts lmao",urcool91,,90,90,2023-02-13 01:46:48
j89swn0,t3_110mq4n,"This is going to sound... unlikely, but I actually had to leave a LOT out to make the above fit the character limit!

There was, as there always is in online fandom, a certain amount of controversy that sparked within the Cabin Pressure fandom. One major one was about fanart, which I had to delete a whole paragraph about- there was a battle over whether the ways in which people were drawing the characters were too focused on the characters being too ""conventionally attractive"" (which eventually led to John Finnemore making an official [statement](http://johnfinnemore.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-hairline-of-captain-martin-crieff.html) on whether Martin is, in fact, bald). It also got contentious when the question of whether Arthur should be skinny or chubby popped up.

There was also a certain amount of splitting of the fandom over Martin's eventual love interest, whose identity I will not spoil but who I think, to a certain degree, serves as evidence for Finnemore having kind of tilted things toward Martin's character in the last two series. Some people loved her, some people thought her character was a bit too much and symbolized an overly Cumberbatch-centric direction for the show, some people were annoyed that their ships were jossed... These days, the vibe I get is ""Cabin Pressure canon is great and what I ship in my free time is my own business."" But out of the 3800+ fics in the Cabin Pressure fandom on AO3, only about 200 are of Martin's canonical romantic pairing.

Also, currently, there is a surprising number of fans who share fanon that Martin is trans, which is an interesting one. Not personally my headcanon but I can see where they're coming from.

If you were part of this very interesting era and can remember other kinds of stuff that's popped up that I forgot and is worthy of note, please let me know! My goal was more to give a rundown of the overall situation, and how it really was, overall, a pretty supportive fandom particularly as it got more specifically Cabin Pressure-focused, though if you have evidence to the contrary please alert me.

Finnemore stepping into Good Omens 2 is also an interesting micro-example of this above-mentioned phenomenon, as a whole new crop of people got into his radio work when he was introduced as Neil Gaiman's new cowriter. (It's basically the only reason I'm excited about S2...) There has also been a LIMITED amount of new crossover with Good Omens- I added a bit of my own contribution, actually, as a fan of the book for nearly as long as of Cabin Pressure- but not as much as in the Sherlock era.

Also, as you can probably tell a BIG goal of mine here was to attempt to get people to listen to Cabin Pressure, which I love dearly. You can start at the beginning, but the first couple of episodes can be a bit shakier and I always think that it starts to hit its stride in the fourth episode, Douz. (I had to cut this for space above, but with a few specific exceptions, the episodes are alphabetically ordered, and you can listen to them in either broadcast order or purely alphabetical order, which is what Finnemore intended.) Then it really only gets better and better until genuinely my favorite finale ever.",hannahstohelit,,96,96,2023-02-12 18:53:21

The Sherlock crossover thing is so interesting to me because I was a teenager who was into Sherlock at the time, but I was also from a family that constantly listened to Radio 4, especially the comedy, and was very into theatre and musicals (and thus Roger Allam) and I have no idea which thread of interest lead to us discovering Cabin Pressure! I'm so glad we did though, it's accompanied me on endless car journeys and sleepless nights and massively infiltrated our family conversations! 

It's so nice to know that so many people are out there who still love the show (regardless of their feelings about Benedict Cumberbatch lol), I can't think of any other radio sitcoms with such strong character development, consistent laughs, and a very satisfying ending.

I really enjoyed series 1 when I first heard it on air and I distinctly recall having to Google the name Benedict Cumberbatch after the first episode, as I couldn't imagine what he could possibly look like (back then the first image that popped up was from a show where Hugh Laurie was his dad!). Then I moved continents and lived a few years without steady internet & tv, and when I got back suddenly it was series 4 and for some reason the audience was louder in the recordings? And there were Sherlock/Cabin Pressure fanfics on AO3, and people were objectifying Martin (of all people lol). I was truly OOTL, and as I had come in the tail end of things it seemed too late to find out.

I got into Cabin Pressure the long way around, it seems- I found Souvenir Programme first, via Mitchell and Webb- but still right at the time it exploded and got outside popular. I was a college freshman in 2011, in the US, but didn't have access to reliable internet (or cable) so I was a bit delayed.

Cabin Pressure got me through college. It got me through putting down our family dog, and I would save episodes until I ""needed"" them. I put the episodes on a playlist on an ancient USB MP3 player and would listen on flights (now they're on my phone, same deal though). It shaped my sense of humor and I often quote it and recommend it to people.

I still have not listened to either Z episode, because then it would be over and done. I can't do it. I don't need it yet, I'm in denial.",zemthings,,3,3,2023-02-15 00:02:09

jd2m2fi,t3_110mq4n,"Hey, I was browsing through past stories on this sub and was really not expecting to see Cabin Pressure! I can't help but join the chorus of people professing love to it because it is so so good. One of my two most favourite radio shows ever (the other one is Bleak Expectations).

I did join it the most common way, being a Sherlock fan back in 2012, but I think it is one of the best thing Sherlock has brought me. My love for Sherlock has certainly died down (even though I am still a Sherlock Holmes fan in general), but Cabin Pressure is a treasure that I can always come back to. I have no idea how many times I've listened to it. And I still have a Martin Crieff T-Shirt! Although Douglas is my favourite character, can't deny it.

I think I would have come to it anyway, I later became a Les Mis fan after the movie and hello Roger Allam (and his magical voice), but I'm just happy to have discovered John Finnemore's writing. I have of course listened to his other programmes and they are indeed brilliant in their own way.  

When amazon announced S2 of Good Omens I was very doubtful, but hearing Finnemore joining in? worlds colliding! certainly happy about that development. maybe the new season is very good in its own way and we will get him working on a discworld project? (i just want a good Night Watch series adaptation, is that too much to ask??). 

Anyway, I'm gonna be honest, when Zurich came out I did not listen to it immediately. The wait was very long and I switched to other things, so it did not feel like an urgency. And it also felt like I can prolong the show in a way. Like, until I have listened to the episode, the show does not end, they are still there. And I will have this one final chapter to look forward to. Until one summer day, I was hiking in the mountains and I just thought ""okay, it's time, I'm ready to say goodbye"". It felt very nice doing it on my own terms. I certainly scared some people on the trail with my sudden laughter, but i'm lucky there was nobody around when I started crying in the end. All my love to Cabin Pressure.

I still have so many quotes stuck in my head. All those games and references and snarky responses. god, it is THE series of all time.

The only thing that I'm a bit upset by is that it's a radio show and I can't show it to my parents who don't speak fluent english! With a movie or a tv series, there are always subtitles or more often dubbing, but it really does not work here! (the translated transcripts is really not the same). and i can't see bbc making it into a tv series, which is probably for the best.   
oh well, you can't have it all.",restless_wind,,2,2,2023-03-21 12:02:59

j9aa5wh,t3_110mq4n,"wow, thank you so much for writing this! My family watched Sherlock and souvenir program and even went to a John Finnemore live show and I didn't realize how much I'd interacted with his stuff until I read this. I think mainly because my mum and brother were fans and I'd get dragged along but didn't mind haha. I had no idea of the weird fandom and kinda forgot Benedict Cumberbatch was in Cabin Pressure. Despite him playing a very egocentric Sherlock, he played a very relatable Michael, and I thought Douglass was the cool one. 

It's so weird learning about all this stuff now, as I listened to a ton of episodes on car journeys but out of order and had no knowledge of the fandom. I think I definitely missed some episodes and the ending. When someone else played Martin, I'd thought he'd been replaced for all future episodes because I wasn't sure which ones were the most recent lol. I'm glad cabin Pressure was liked by many people. I really liked it and Arthur's mannerisms are definitely a joke in my family.

When I went to John's live show I didn't really know much about his history of works or how popular they were. So when I heard Cabin Pressure quotes being said by the audience I was surprised lol. Luckily John delivered with his last sketch when the final line was the actor who played Douglass saying ""well done"" or something played out of the speakers with echo, meant to sound all heavenly.

Looking back, I hope John Finnemore goes on to write something just as good with his feel-good style of writing. After finishing breaking bad, I see parallels with people like Aaron Paul seeing working with people like Bryan Cranston being the glory days and something he'll never top, which I hope isn't true. I hope John Finnemore doesn't feel like that with Benedict Cumberbatch. Hopefully he does good in Good Omens, and gets a big speaking roll in something soon! (although maybe he has I haven't really been keeping up lol). Also I hope Benedict Cumberbatch remembers Cabin Pressure, and also gets to play a layered character (not really enjoying Marvel and Dr. Strange doesn't really do anything for me).

It’s weird to think that it’s nearly a decade since first being introduced to those works, loved the write up!

One of my proudest(?) moments as a Cabin Pressure fan had to be when my father, never having listened to a single episode but having observed me and my husband playing Yellow Car over the past few days, called a Yellow Car from the backseat. It was totally out of nowhere, a completely silent car, no one had called any Yellow Cars that day. My husband turns to me in the passenger seat and goes ""I didn't even know he was playing."" Dad pipes up from the back ""you're *always* playing Yellow Car!"" Same emphasis and everything. No one understood why I was laughing so hard (husband also has never listened to the show, but has graciously adopted Yellow Car as the price of my co-piloting).

jl8vhdw,t3_110mq4n,"Wow! Such a good summary of my favourite intersection of fandoms!
I’m 29 now, but I’ve been a massive fan of radio comedy for as long as I can remember - I remember looking forward to The Now Show when I was in early primary school, but having no idea about any of the news that the jokes referred to. Think I really got into radio sitcoms when I was home sick & the first ever play of Bleak Expectations came on the radio. I’d heard Cabin Pressure when it first played, and very much enjoyed it.

A little later, I caught the first episode of Sherlock (age 17 or 18?)  and was instantly hooked, instantly obsessed. A friend in 6th form introduced me to tumblr around that time, and I got very into the fandom. Actually met my first girlfriend through the Sherlock fans map local meet up.

I was fully amazed to find people similarly geeking out about Cabin Pressure - weirdly enough, not a tonne of huge Radio 4 fans in my year at school. I fully loved the community & artwork. I actually took a photo of a lemon for the lemon art book!
I also tried to go to a recording, with my little sister, but didn’t realise that the tickets were not a guarantee of a seat (travelled across the country to do so). It was a really lovely community. 

I saw a practice run of Souvenir program in a small pub in London (my dad was in the city for some reason, and I managed to split off to go and watch it - I was 18 by then, bought my first ever Bloody Mary. John Finnemore was really lovely - I was a very awkward teen, and he really put me at ease & signed an autograph.

A little later, I came back from uni for the weekend to see my girlfriend, who, together with her parents, had been on the waitlist for a Benedict Cumberbatch & Louise Brealy interview at the Cheltenham Literary festival. I think maybe family of one of the two had dropped out, because the 4 seats were right in the middle of the front row. 

Cumberbatch signed my autograph book afterwards as we filtered past the table. He asked me who else was in the book, and when I said ‘John Finnemore’ he exclaimed ‘Ah! Cabin Pressure fan!’

While waiting in the signing line, which had held the queue for J.K. Rowling’s talk attendees to have their copies of the Casual Vacancy signed just an hour earlier, the shine began to fall off fandom for me. What seemed fun and joking online had a slightly creepy edge in person. The Sherlock meet-up had been exclusively late teen/ early twenties girls, and was awkward but earnest and enthusiastic. Here, the queue seemed a bit intense. A woman in her fourties’ told me about her ‘shrine’ to Cumberbatch. We waited for a long time for our signatures, and my sense of unease continued to grow.
I gradually drifted away from the fandom space after. My girlfriend a while after that (unrelated, long-distance).

I still enjoyed the TV show, and engaged with the Cabin Pressure fandom for a fair bit longer than the Sherlock fandom. There was overlap, but it seemed less intense, more appreciative and less obsessive.

The failure of the national team has finally highlighted those flaws to such an extent that even the biggest MLS fanboys can no longer ignore the discussion.

I don't know what will happen with the upcoming USSF presidential election, but even if a status-quo figure wins out I still have hope that recent events will eventually bring about change that will put us on a better path.

dpx7d98,t3_7ddvk4,"You're completely right. Things do kinda suck right now.

But it's important for us to think about what sucks, and whether it will continue to suck. The truth is that we've had a confluence of events hit us all at once, which is not fun at all. It's been hard for me to not be bogged down by that, but I think there's plenty of reason to not feel as though the sky is falling.

I have a huge problem with the idea of burning it all down. Yeah, I felt that way for a bit after the TNT game. It was frustrating, unacceptable, and so embarrassing that I actually spent a decent amount of time talking to my therapist about the way it made me feel about myself (which is slightly embarrassing in itself, but that's how much I care about this stuff). But by burning it down, what are we honestly going to change?

Let's look at the difference in player development from the start of our WC ""streak"" to the end of it. In 1990, the idea of domestic player development was virtually nonexistent, save for the college system, which is obviously not good enough to develop world class players. There were competitive youth clubs, but in terms of coaching they were significantly behind. Things picked up very slowly over the course of the 90s, and by the 2000s we had an increase in the number of youth teams, and a lot of foreign coaches (from England mostly, which is an issue itself) coming to help out teams for months at a time (thereby collecting an easy paycheck). Towards the end of the 2000s, MLS teams started creating high level academies, and in the 2010s we've seen a ton of new youth clubs created alongside them (I'm coaching high school soccer right now, it's easy to see that there was a boom in the number of clubs, even in the somewhat saturated Bay Area). We've now produced a few players in Pulisic and McKennie, who are teenagers starting games for large teams in the biggest leagues in the world. They're only 2 players, but there are quite a few players following them. They're not the first Americans to do well in Europe, but they're some of the first young ones, and some of the first that can potentially be up there with the world's best. I'd argue that their closest comparisons were Landon, who is perhaps our most talented player every, but couldn't cut it for a large German team while at their age and was forced to settle for MLS.

There is clear, clear progress on this front. No, it's not perfect. Yeah, there are major issues with pay-to-play. Yeah, we should be doing a better job reaching talent outside of the traditional soccer demographics. But there is extremely clear, undeniable progression on this front. I grew up playing in the late 90's/early 2000's, and the difference in coaching from then and now is remarkable. The difference in time that youth players put in now is incredible (we practiced maybe twice a week, the typical youth player is practicing 3 times a week, and is spending time on film study to complement that). Teams of my generation grew up playing solely 4-4-2, whereas players now grow up playing the attacking style that everyone demanded.

That's a key group to help pull off that sort of thing, but I can see why they wouldn't want to go there. I think they merely issued a letter of dissatisfaction, whatever that's supposed to do. Now it's buried in Facebook somewhere. Maybe a few SG's had #savethecrew flags or tifo, not sure. If they did something, I guess it didn't work so there goes that idea.  
  
Anyway, I think we could send a very strong message if the ISC quarterbacked a one-time boycott of MLS Cup to send the message across. Nobody views the game. Nobody visits. Nobody writes about it. Something like that would definitely get picked up by mainstream sports media, right? Wouldn't they love to pick on any blemish MLS picks up?

dpx4chi,t3_7ddvk4,"What's funny to me is seeing we - the hardcore fanbase - rioting while the sport at large remains largely irrelevant to the US public. 

Like, what ground do the powers at be have to stand on here? They've been feeding us  potential for decades, yet by all measurable standards they're failing. The on the field product has not markedly improved - how can it when you're expanding at a rate of two teams every two years?; TV ratings remain largely stagnant, like honestly guys no one working in TV will tell you that a 2.3 rating is a healthy thing, and that's the HIGH bracket for MLS!; we just failed to qualify for a WC, which means no post-WC boom cycle; and with the whole Columbus SC debacle the owners just showed their true colors.

On the one hand the apathy means the powers at large can get away with it all, but on the other it's like c'mon guys, you're fighting over scraps here! Everything you've built and will build predicates on the World Cup, and now that's gone. How can you not acknowledge something is wrong? Next time your partners in business negotiate with you there will be a reckoning. I don't see how you can sell more expensive TV rights or higher expansion fees with a straight face. 

Something is deeply rotten in our system yet the relatively anonymity of the sport and its fans means that they can largely ignore us and continue, business as usual. 

What we need is a capitalist champion or champions. The only thing that they'll respond to is competition, which ironically is at the core of the promotion / relegation argument. Instead of competition within the clubs, we need competition with the league. There's tons of grass roots soccer support across this country - the success of Indy 11, Cincinatti FC, Sacramento FC, etc. etc. is a testament to that. The only way I see the status quo changing is if someone can organize those dissident factions into an organization which peaks all at once - not in separate years, but all together, with strong numbers and a stable business model. They need to show that there's an alternative, viable product to be had. 

And honestly? It's probably achievable. We have American [historic precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Basketball_Association), and MLS' on field product is not polished enough to be insurmountable. I hope that one of us reading here has enough resources to make it happen. Mark Cuban, if you're reading this, please be our soccer Jesus. 

The biggest obstacle is collusion... and unfortunately that's the barrel we're facing with the NASL, USSF, and SUM debacle. We need REAL competition to change things in this country. US Soccer does not belong to MLS. US Soccer belongs to US! ",rrayy,,63,63,2017-11-16 18:37:15

If no team is safe and any team can be taken from an MLS city, I'd rather that the decisions of who stays and who goes is based on merit rather than the whims of a few rich jerks.

It's fair for all this to get you pretty down for a while, but once you've had a good few drinks/cries/whatever your coping mechanism is, consider trying to get involved in local soccer, which is what I did (recently started refereeing youth games).

dpx3gpy,t3_7ddvk4,"I think MLS fans got and are getting somewhat played by US Soccer and MLS. 

For the longest time, we put up a lot of moneygrabbing shit from MLS because ""you've all seen what happened to the NASL"" etc. etc. etc. We had to reach a bottom line and ""sustainability"" because otherwise the league would fold, just like the other leagues in this country had. You wouldn't want that to happen, would you? So you toe the party line, and that's why the ridiculous ""fans of the league"" exist, because they've been told the growth of MLS is good for the growth of the sport in the United States. 

The problem is now, after constant expansion and a few self-sustaining, profitable teams, you'd expect that to change.  I do think we're probably at a point where *teams* have started to focus more on development of players than simply money making opportunities, but we haven't seen the same from the league. The Sounders moving S2 from free rent Starfire to Tacoma is a good example, and one that will absolutely hurt their bottom line in the short term. But it's good for the community of Tacoma, good for their business partners in the Rainiers, and good for the players of S2. That's not a move we would've seen 5 years ago. But at the same time, it's announced after the largest season ticket price hikes in the clubs history and potentially declining attendance... 

But we haven't seen those sorts of moves from the league, and the clubs are the ones pushing the envelope instead. The addition of more TAM would be a good step, as would the restructuring of transfer fees received, but where was that 5 years ago? We've already seen two of the most talented young defenders in MLS in Joevin Jones and Ambroise Oyongo leave for free because their teams decided another year of them was more valuable than some trickle down funny money. When/if Columbus leaves to go play in a half empty college football or baseball stadium, what happens to their youth academy and the players in it? 

I'm over it. Add in the largest source of news about the league being league-run and it just seems all a bit mickey mouse and plastic. I don't hope MLS fails, but I hope they open their eyes, and realize that fans of the sport in the United States are finally starting to push back. MLS is still probably the 3rd or 4th most popular *soccer* league in the United States, and more people wake up at 6:30am to watch fucking Bournemouth than a primetime MLS game. 

I won't stop watching the Sounders because I do think they're trying to do the right thing, and they do still feel rooted in the community, but I've no longer got any interests in season tickets, MLS Live, or watching anyone else. 

I think /u/OpenWideForSUMSoccer put it better than I could in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/7709r6/anthony_precourt_mls_betrayal_of_trust/doi3ieu/) though, and I'd recommend you read that instead of mine. ",,,25,25,2017-11-16 18:23:29

It's not that they aren't trying to make it better, it's the way every ""improvement"" also makes the league more closed, bureaucratic and weird.

dpx3jeb,t3_7ddvk4,"Things are actually really, really great. Says this MLS/US Soccer fan of over 20 years. The state of the game in the US has never been stronger. 

1. We have a strong domestic league that is growing, getting better every year, and is (by most estimates) profitable. I took a sports law class in 2001 from a lawyer who worked in-house at the NFL. During the first class, he asked everybody to say something about their relationship to sports. I was the ONLY person to mention any interest in MLS (out of 100 or so). His first question to me was ""do you really think the league is going to survive?"" That doesn't happen anymore. 

2. Player development at the youth levels has come miles in the last 15 years with MLS academies. It isn't perfect, but its much better than it was. Pros are developing pros. No more Bradenton or ""Project 40"" or hokey MLS reserve squads. 

3. Pro levels below MLS are in a state of chaos - but they always have been. The old A-league and its lower level leagues added and lost new teams of marginal stability yearly. The only difference is now there is more interest in the game at those levels, and more investment, so the chaos is bigger. But look at what is happening down there on a team by team basis, and its incredible compared to 15 years ago, when I used to go to Sounders games and could literally count the number of fans in the stadium. 

4. The NWSL still exists. This in and of itself is significant, given the turbulent nature of past women's leagues.

5. The US National team player pool has never been broader or deeper. We have more players playing at a high level at home and abroad than ever before. Its not as good at the top as it has been at other times (that 2002 team is looking like a golden generation in hindsight) but this is cyclical. It is for every country. It won't always be like this. Why? See points 1-3 above. 

6. US Soccer leadership is resistant to change. Duh. This is the organization that has had one president in the last ten years, and that gave Kinsman a new contract after the World Cup, even though Arena and Bradley both sucked during their second contracts. The difference? People actually care about its organizational failings now. Nobody really cared before. Gulati ran unopposed. Its a sign of the game's growing strength that fans, media, and players are even talking about how fucked up US soccer. It being fucked up is nothing new.

dpxbfgq,t3_7ddvk4,"I was thinking about making a post about this yesterday, but I guess you beat me to it :)

I can't help but feel that I've lost much of my passion for soccer this year. Suffering from depression has made me lose interest in a lot of things I used to love. I've loved soccer ever since I first kicked around a rubber ball at three years old and I've kept my love for the game all these years. 

But the US not qualifying for the World Cup hurt me pretty deep. I'm first and foremost a USMNT fan. I'll never forget being at  a party watching the 2014 World Cup and leaping out of my armchair with joy after Dempsey scored the goal that momentarily put us ahead of Portugal in the Group of Death. I've watched basically every US game since then, be it a friendly or a competitive game. American soccer in general has always been a topic of interest for me, and I enjoy discussing how it can (or should) get better.

The US not qualifying, to me, was a slap in the face as a US fan. We're in fucking CONCACAF. We crashed out playing against a team where most of the players wouldn't even make the bench in MLS. US Soccer's complacent attitude before, during, and after this nightmare hit me even harder. Why the fuck was Arena even allowed to show his face in public, much less participate as an ""analyst""?  Why is Gulati pretending that this isn't a sinking ship, and why hasn't he resigned yet after the possibly) irreversible damage he has caused to US Soccer?

The US not qualifying had several implications beyond simply missing a tournament. One, it will hinder the growth of soccer in the US as casual fans won't be able to tune in to watch the US play. Face it, about half of you guys started watching soccer after the last World Cup. There's also the fact that Pulisic will have to wait five years until his next major international tournament. And it hinders our 2026 World Cup bid.

Ever since I started watching MLS I've been critical of its setup, including its lack of transparency. The Columbus relocation was another slap in the face, as it shows that MLS cares more about owners' money than it does about us fans. It's absolutely unfortunate that a whole city's sports fanbase is being fucked over due to  the greed of a billionaire. Columbus, as much as I hate them, have a great fanbase and were MLS's first team. Seeing them destroyed like this is just unbearable.

I apologize for my rant, but I've kept fairly quiet about how utterly disgusted I am with the higher ups among US Soccer and MLS and I just needed a platform to get these thoughts out of my head.",RickyTheSticky,,6,6,2017-11-16 20:31:11

A lot of the current academy products are really just strong players who were developed from anther club, and signed with the MLS academy when they were 16.

No, there isn't, because the fans can't agree on what to do.

Actually, as I type that, here's something I think we can all agree on: the federation needs to publish ""The Plan"". Where are we going, and how will we get there.

Warning: This is a ""when I was your age, I had to walk to school in the snow, with no shoes"" rant.


I started playing in '66 as a kid. there were no ""major leagues"" not even a tier. The soccer was played by mostly ethnic teams set up by emigres. If you were a kid, and played in a Hispanic league, you played only if you were good enough, so naturally, a lot of young white kids complained and viola, the AYSO was formed. The first league that was set up for kids, but it was set up because anglos (and I am an anglo) could not get playing time in those leagues, and they complained of discrimination, but more importantly, they wanted park time in the suburbs,  they were usually booked saturday (and even sunday) by the various ethnic league in the So Cal. area

""Everybody plays"" was the mantra, but that model turned out hundreds of kids that did not play very well, compared to the ethnic leagues, but flooded into the HS's but had no teams to play on. There were even fewer HS that offered soccer as a sport and even fewer colleges had teams and even fewer that offered scholarships. Academies? non-existent. Pro Leagues? Non existent. until '69. and until the advent of the NASL, and in most regions in the US, there was no lower divisions. But soccer was played in almost all the big cities with immigrants, and it kept the flame alive.

In 1975 the USMNT had one of the best coaches on the face of the earth. A German whom most never heard of. Dettmar Cramer was the USMNT coach for less than a year, but had a blueprint to establish a foundation for US soccer. He set up Soccer in Japan after the war, and then set up soccer in Egypt, yet the USSF (or USSAF) did not give him a written contract and after a year of hemming and hawwing the US lost him to Bayern Munich who went of to win, the next year, under his guidance, the UEFA Champions Cup, and then did it again the next year. 

Instead the US went with local and mostly immigrant part-time coaches until the 80's. In the 1985 WCQ game the us missed a free kick that could have sent it to the WC. It was composed of only a few professional, and most were college kids. This was a year after the US failed at its own home Olympics and a year after the NASL folded. If you wanted to be depressed about US soccer and its future, that was no better a time to feel futility.

In the 70's if you went to a USMNT game, it was probably in LA where games against Mexico brought in 40K to the Coliseum and games against El Salvador and Honduras would bring in 20K, these, outside of the New York, New Jersey areas were the only ones that brought in over 20K in the whole of the US. They were the big moneymakers for the USSF, who had few sponsors and even fewer fans.

If you did get to a WCQ game against Mexico like I did in LA, of the 40K people there 39900 were rooting for Mexico. We have 3rd division teams attract almost that much *every week* now.

We have made amazing progress in the last 40-50 years, but the progress was not revolutionary, it was evolutionary. We learned from our mistakes, but in some cases we make the same ones.

we have a lot of people coming into the sport who want too much too soon. We have too many people coming into the sport with money, but do not know quite how to use it efficiently.

We have too many people who want to adopt policies and rules developed in different nations and in a different time, for a different society that do not work, and will probably never work, in the US.

Above all, we have the largest population of any nation were we have been developing players at a very fast clip. We have an enormous amount of money targeted towards sports in this nation, but soccer gets the smallest percentage. But its changing, and for the good. Soccer teams are **making money**. Yes they are few, but as far as I know, none of the old NASL teams made money.

The sport now  has a huge upside in this nation, but you can expect failures as well as successes.

The MLS will make mistakes, but it should survive them, The NASL made similar mistakes but had no money behind and folded. The average attendance during its heyday was over 18K, that average!.No money was really made to grow the sport, because there was no cost containment, rents were high and there was no TV right deal. There was no development either. I played as a ""practice player"" for the LA Aztecs in '76 as the team in the pre-season did not have many players under contract!! They needed to bring in local players as they did not have 22 players for a pickup or practice game!! It was a nickel and dime league for the most part. I think at the time, I was the only US born player in those games.

The Soccer Bowl, the NASL version of the MLS Cup, once brought in a 30 percent share on ABC, compared to today's MLS ratings, it's huge, but the NFL's Super Bowl brought in 60-70 percent share. its all a matter of scale.

But a caveat here:

the USSF and the MLS need to do their homework. Something they sometime fail to do. the drivers who brought in the MLS, were also some of the owners who owned teams in the old NASL and saw them fail, and vowed to change things, and although they got heat from the purists who said ""its not like European football, or Futbol"" prevailed to create the most successful soccer league in US history, and one of the most financially successful. 

The USSF has had its first endemic failure since the 80'swhen it did not qualify for the WC but it was forewarned by the failure of the US Olympic efforts the previous years. 

But before we attach blame to the coaches and players, we need an top down evaluation covering a whole range of issues, how we hire, travel, train and how we prepare. In one of our Olympic Qualifying events, we had two games in the US at altitude, yet the US had no prep at altitude prior to the those games, while Honduras had a three week camp at altitude, the Honduras went to the games the US stayed home. We did not have an alternate field to train and practice when the US played Trinidad and were flooded out the day before!. Preparation failure or bad oversight. Somehow, we lost how to prepare for the worst, and only hoped for the best. 

I may be wrong (I don't think so) but we need a good review before we start making substantive changes.

So cheer up everybody, its NOT THAT BAD, all things considered. We have a successful and growing domestic league, and with a few hiccups, a successful lower division. A Women's soccer team, the best in the world and more importantly. thousands of kids getting competent coaching instead of dozens or hundreds, and that number will grow tremendously in the next few years. We have some very promising players. We recently tied the third ranked team in the world with a new team, on their turf and by most accounts, the better team.

i7feq9m,t3_uivv0g,"**IV) Carlo Ancelotti is one of the GOATs**   
It grinds my gears when people go with the narrative that Don Carlo is just a good man manager, like that's the only reason he has won the Top 5 leagues (only manager to ever do that), won 3 Cups in Italy, England, and Spain, and reached 5 UCL finals winning 3 (or 4, we'll see).   
  
Tactically, Don Carlo started out as a traditional 442 manager with Parma but later switched to 3412 at Juventus to accommodate Zidane in the n.10 role. Then at Milan he switched again to 4321 (known as the Christmas Tree) and transferred attacking midfielder Pirlo to the world best deep lying playmaker and had Inzaghi as the lone striker.   
   
When he moved to Chelsea he played a 442 Diamond with Lampard and Ballack as box to box mids. Then at Real he yet again switched to 433 to have CR7 at his best position as a left inside forward.   
   
This fluidity and adaptability was crucial in his success as a manager by allowing players to thrive in their favourite positions playing with freedom to showcase their abilities. This instilled trust in them and made them produce their best output under his management. His teams were defensively organised and rigid but offensively direct and dynamic.    
   
Carlo Ancelotti is the pioneer of the category of managers that don't have a robotic system that they impose on their players, but rather those who customize tailor-made systems that incorporates players in their best positions having the freedom to express themselves on the pitch. That's why he's certainly one of the greatest football managers of all time.",PharaohLeo,,43,43,2022-05-05 14:11:47

 My football explanation is this. Teams like city and barca who play ""tiki taka"" could never make an overturn like this. ""Tiki taka"" in his perfect form can provide you a total football and can destroy even the best teams. But if something goes wrong, you re done. 
Players who serve this style of football, are like robots who do everything mechanical, without plan b when the circumstances demands it. 
To be honest, to overturn a match like this, you need a crossing, you need a header, you need nerves. Something that Real Madrid has completely, and city has not, even in the minimum.

i7fivfe,t3_uivv0g,"I don't even know how to encapsulate just how miraculous this Real Madrid run has been.

Real Madrid were 17-1 to win the UCL at some bookies prior to their first game against PSG.

PSG were favoured against Real Madrid, were up 2 goals, and then within a 15 minute period, were dead and buried by a Benzema hat trick.

Reigning UCL champions Chelsea were favoured against Real Madrid, had fought their way into a winning position after being stunned at home in the first leg, but they would succumb to a late Rodrygo goal created out of nothing and fall to a Benzema header in extra time.

Reigning English Champions City were also favoured against Real Madrid, they battered them in the first leg at the Ethihad yet still only had a 1 goal advantage to show for it. After increasing their advantage to 2 goals on aggregate in the second half and coming close to a third, you could see them thinking already about Paris, even some of Real Madrid's home fans had left, hopeless -- and yet, City too would falter, stunned by one Rodrygo goal in the 90th minute, then stupefied by another within 70 seconds. By extra time Madrid's victory felt assured, Benzema inevitable, when he was taken down in the area and the ref pointed to the spot it was manifest destiny.

&#x200B;

Telling in so many of these games to me, was, for lack of a better term or words, 'championship pedigree', the degree to which Real Madrid had 'it' and the other teams lacked 'it'.

When these bested teams had their advantage, you could see-- you could feel them just playing out the clock, desperate for the game to be over.

I feel like this quality is what allowed Real Madrid to creep back into these ties, they smell blood in the water, they can tell when a team has mentally switched off just that little bit, and when they do unexpectedly strike back it is transparent how crestfallen the opponents have seemed once Real Madrid assert themselves, like they've accepted their defeat as being part of their destiny, as much as Madrid saw being the unlikely victors as a part of theirs.

&#x200B;

In the aftermath of this completely epic run, it's been really interesting and sort of hilarious seeing how some of the pundits have framed these defeats after the fact. Certain ones I've listened to have seemed to just completely dismissed or undersold Real Madrid's unique qualities in these comeback wins.

Hearing them tell it, it was all about the defeated teams' mistakes, how they set up wrong, how unlucky they were, that 'the better team lost'.

I know they're biased, but still bears mention, I saw a clip yesterday of Carragher boldly stating, with no doubt whatsoever, that City were the better team -- despite the fact that they had just played 2 games and came up short! Despite Madrid defeating a gauntlet of challenging competition en route to the final, and proving themselves more battle-tested than City.

So many of these post-mortem comments attribute the favourites' drawbacks to bad luck, like it could have happened against anybody, ignoring how much these teams have been outplayed, albeit in small but utterly lethal doses in certain cases, because it goes against the pre-conceived narrative they've constructed and doubled-down on.

It is beyond good fortune, this is a team that knows how to walk an opponent down, that has a brutally efficient, clinical quality to them.

Not only that -- but Real Madrid are already reigning La Liga champions with 4 weeks to spare, they had just beaten the team who bested City in last year's final, and before that beaten the semi-final team City had to make the final the same season.

Part of becoming a UCL power-house is knowing how to kill off a game, to put an opponent down and out.

Yesterday's Madrid win was not an isolated incident, Real Madrid have done this 3 times this campaign, multiple times in the past.

Consequent to the group-stage, Real Madrid arguably (and unluckily) had the toughest seeding route to the final, and yet, crazy as it is to believe, Real Madrid have qualified for 10 of the last 12 UCL Semi Finals, their 5th final in less than a decade, this team transcends luck.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Originally had a line saying how City barely protested the PK, looked to me like they were going through motions of it, but they did contest it as everyone does I suppose so changed it to manifest destiny line.",,,27,27,2022-05-05 14:40:17

Also I must say that I've never been particularly fond of the whole ""Hoes Mad"" thing. Like sure, there are situations where someone else's misery is actually pretty funny, but that's normally reserved for when the miserable person is actually, y'know, bad. 

Really not sure why ""This makes another human being feel bad about their own hobby, which you also share"" became a *good* thing in gaming circles. From ""Troll"" characters in fighting games to Stall teams in Pokemon to Basically Every Sniper Rifle Ever Made, why is ""Being a Dick to Another Human Being"" something not only applauded, but endorsed by devs?

Maybe I'd understand more if I aligned with either side of the gripesplosion, but I don't.

m2ha1ac,t3_1hg7txd,"Many reasons not to support a WC there, and this would be a minor inconvenience to me if I was there (a nice beer in the stands is always great to go with a game) but honestly not a huge deal.



Bit unrelated but it's always a bit strange to me how English fans can feel so strongly about this - as a German, it feels like just one step further from the ""no alcohol in the stands"" rule in English football. 


Sure, everytime I fly over and watch a Spurs game I have a pint or two before and/or after the game, but  that's mostly because I'm there super early and take in the occasion - here in Germany I don't stand outside in a nice stadium lounge for an hour or so beforehand (well, we don't have one lmao) but instead drink my beer while watching the game.



Guess it just seems a bit strange that banning alcohol is such a big deal when over there you can only drink it in the very inconvenient 15 minute half time break or before the game if you arrive way early anyway.

It was odd only in that it hadn't been a theme of their (frankly until then underwhelming) feud/build to their match. But the content of the promo wasn't odd - it literally mirrored what Eddie Kingston had said in his promos during his feud with Punk. And the overwhelming majority of the audience wouldn't have known that it was an oblique reference to the rumors about Colt. Was it Hangman's most effective promo? Not by a long shot. Was it ""incredibly unprofesisonal""? Nobody, including Punk, has been able to actually explain why it was. Nor has anyone been able to explain *how* Hangman's promo allegedly hurt the draw of the match. People on Punk's side say it did, but they don't elaborate (I suspect because aside from Punk's assertion that it did, there's no evidence it did and no reason to think it that doesn't require a metric fuckton of hindsight)

Beyond that, you know what is unprofessional though? To rip Colt Cabana, who's not a part of this, from a live mic about shit like the alleged joint account with his mom from litigation nearly a decade ago. Colt hasn't been saying shit. Colt hasn't been spreading rumors. Colt didn't deserve to have Punk put his (what Punk thinks is) dirty laundry on blast to all the media just because Punk was pissed at some reporters and other people in the locker room

And if, as you say, Punk said fighting words at the scrum, then the confrontation following and Punk's violence are *his* fault, not the Bucks'.

* The ""on air"" promo was odd, but not worse than MJF or Eddie Kingston, specifically on-screen
* There was a backstage meeting with very little information about it. 

&#x200B;

>When he returned, he got his receipt on Hangman

* Receipts are a ""thing"" in wrestling, but 2 wrongs don't make a right
* Punk's receipt was more extreme
   * Page ""went off-script"" in a promo where Puck was, and Punk had a chance to immediately respond, in a way to make the build for DON stronger
   * Page did it when they were in a program together
   * Punk gave his receipt when Page could not respond without screwing up the timing and plan of the company.  If Page came out to respond, Page is the one disrespecting the company and Moxley.
   * Punk's receipt came with no planned program between them, therefore no payoff.

&#x200B;

>Punk selflessly agreed to drop the title to Moxley

Punk only took 2 losses in AEW. He only took them with the booking already planned to ""get his win back"".  

&#x200B;

>Wrestling journalists had spent weeks speculating about CM Punk’s backstage actions and in many cases sullying his name.

Over a year, actually.  People were speculating and commenting on how Punk and Colt would coexist in a company over a year ago now.  It got heightened when his contract was up and then renewed.  

Someone leaked that the Bucks went to bat for Colt to get him re-signed.  Speculation from that was that Punk led the charge to get him out of AEW. Colt to ROH could make sense as veteran presence and willingness to help others.  Also, Dark Order was being pared back (Stu and Alan Angels not being renewed, Anna changing groups, etc).

&#x200B;

Without knowing what Page and Punk agreed to before their promo, we only know that Punk thinks Page took things too far.  We don't know the before and after.

Punk took the receipt further than the initial issue promo issue in regards to potential harm to the company.

Punk's premeditated ""gripebomb"" in the scrum is also founded on rumors and innuendo, unless he know specifically who each leak is, and he should have then announced it during his tirade.

&#x200B;

>Kenny and the Young Bucks and their entourage came to the door of this tired, frustrated, injured man, barged in

They came to talk to him. Not sure if they ""barged in"". We know the Head of Legal was there.  

If the EVPs knew he was hurt, and was going to be gone for a while, they may have wanted to address the situation, as requested by Punk, as soon as possible because he was going to be gone again.  

&#x200B;

You have made more one sided assumptions than anything else.  Punk 100% in the wrong for throwing punches unless every assumption goes positive for him.  And even if every assumption goes positive for him, he is still a great deal in the wrong.  

The Bucks specifically as EVPs could also be in the wrong. They could be part of leaks. They could be acting like babies.  They could have told legal they were going to confront Punk and Legal could have followed them. They could have barged in.  Again, 2 wrongs don't make a right.  So both sides can both be in the wrong.",FWdem,,8,8,2022-09-19 16:53:49

Punk called out Hangman when it was not in the script (unprofessional)

Punk made rude and unfair comments about Hangman in the scrum (uncalled for)

The scrum was completely unprofessional. The Elite grabbed the head of talent relations (Chris Daniels) and the head of legal (Megha) before going to talk to Punk. That tells me they did not go there planning to fight but to instead talk.

I think the most important point to remember for all of us is that we weren't there and all of us are going by reports from dirt sheets that may or not be the total story. Also all of us have ingrained biases whether we think we do or not. Personally The Elite are one of the main reasons I got back into wrestling and BTE is something I look forward to weekly.

I think to separate the presser from the fight is the best approach here, and it's tough to absolve CM Punk for how he acted and what he said. 

At a certain point you need to start taking responsibility for your actions and realize when it's not the right time to discuss things. As a professional adult, at no point have I ever shit all over my colleagues or bosses (a) publicly (b) in a forum where they can hear it. No, I'm not an athlete, but in IT there are tons of fires and tons of idiots that cost the company money. I'm expected to stay cool under pressure and I do. Or I ask to be excused to compose myself. 

Don't get me wrong, I like Punk. But I feel that he burnt the entire company during the scrum and I certainly don't view him the same way I did.

I’ve been with AEW since Day One.  But the actions of Hangman and the Bucks (and Kenny?) pre-scrum are unbecoming of professionals and EVP’s —just as Punk said.  And the aftermath brawl further muddies their rep —and the rep of the World Champ who is also an adult who should have known better.  All have put the success of the company’s future in jeopardy, ruining booking, costing the other wrestlers potential paydays, and robbing the fans of some of the best AEW has to offer.

I didn’t care for Punk in WWE.  But man, it would be such a crime to see him not come back AEW.  Like it or not, the man puts butts in seats, draws eyeballs, has been central to the company’s best program/feud (which still has plenty of meat left on the bone), and brings a legitimacy to the company that our indie-obsessed fans can’t seem to accept nor want.

He was around for that indie bit, but then he was around when WWE was bringing in indie guys, and he was in that system, and now he is on the other side of what wrestling is, you know, past that."" -Ricky Starks

  
“There are things that stuck out about Punk from an early age… he stood out from the rest of us. He was so great at the promos. I have a lot of respect for him. He’s been through the grind… I’m happy for him now, too. What he’s doing, and the way he’s doing it, it’s amazing.” -Bryan Danielson

  
“Punk is one of those dudes that, after every match that I have that airs, he always sits down and watches it with me. So we sit down together and we break down stuff. So he may get mad, but I told the whole world Punk - you’re that dude. But that match in Arthur Ashe in New York City in front of 20,000 plus people, it was crazy and that whole night had a special meaning to me. Punk knew that because it was about a month since my mom had passed away. So it’s just emotions and everything was everywhere, you know? Before the - I think right before the match got announced, or the day the match got announced, he pulled me aside, you know, and said, ‘This is going to be for her. Don’t worry about anything else, nobody else. It’s just you, me, and her’. And for that, I will forever be grateful for.” -Powerhouse Hobbs

  
“CM Punk, he’s truly amazing to me. Hearing the crowd respond to him, it’s made me turn back the clock and think of all the different memorable reactions over the years to different wrestlers. I’ve especially been thinking about The Road Warriors. Animal was really big on that. He would say, ‘This guy got a huge pop, but it wasn’t a Road Warrior pop.’ That’s what Punk gets. I had an idea of CM Punk’s greatness, but now I have experienced it. His appearances are so electrifying. He is remarkable, and I am grateful to have this opportunity to be in the ring with him and Darby as their tag team partner.” -Sting

  
""I think it's a lot of things from the past, mostly. I think there's a lot of old grudges. I think there's a lot of old biases. I know there's going to be old tension. But as far as how he is as a person now, he couldn't be more inviting. He couldn't be more company-oriented as far as what he's thinking and anything to the contrary; I really think it's uneducated to go off of it because there's only been one side (and) that's all been the negative stuff.” -Cash Wheeler

  
“’CM Punk goes into business for himself’ is a much better headline than ‘CM Punk invites Will Hobbs into his locker room and explains to him for 30 minutes what he could have done to better.’” -Dax Harwood

  
""It's a good feeling, man. As wrestlers, we obviously crave some sort of validation from people, but I feel like, as wrestlers, we appreciate that validation even more from our peers. And we appreciate validation from people we look up to. So, people like CM Punk who I grew up watching and is my mom's favorite wrestler ever, it's really cool to hear that kind of stuff from him. Sometimes you can get down on yourself when people talk bad about you on forums and stuff like that, but when you hear yourself getting credit from someone who has made millions of dollars from being a wrestler and is widely considered one of the greatest of all time, it makes you stop and think 'maybe I'm doing the right thing.’"" -Daniel Garcia

That told me what kind of guy he was, that he was educated on who was on the roster from top to bottom. I was just nervous that CM Punk was here. He’s a hero of mine, he really is. For him to say, ‘hello’ is huge.” -Max Caster

  
""I have a great relationship with Punk. He was here a couple weeks in, I barely knew him at the time, and he just had wrestled a match, and he was taking the time out to pull Dante and I to his trailer to do tape study. He's been a resource since he's came. So I think he's been a good asset to the company, especially from an analytical point of view too, from all the money that he brings in and the ratings and such."" -Anthony Bowens

  
“I have gotten to talk to them about different things and pick their brain, or they have offered me advice and input \[on their own accord\]. Both of those guys \[Chris Jericho and CM Punk\], and really all of the veterans who have been around the block in the pro wrestling world, have gotten the chance to really help some of the younger AEW talent and that’s me included. I’ve always been a guy that constantly wants to progress, move forward and get better so I am by no means someone who doesn’t want to hear advice or input. I am open ears for those guys anytime they have anything to say. And CM Punk, he is top three or four most influential professional wrestlers to me. As far how I think about wrestling, what I want to focus on and what I want to get good at.” -Adam Cole

m2mqbaq,t3_1hgjx83,"this is so wrong. Yesterday an independent research group in London released a report on what the real numbers versus what’s been reported by both sides really are. The net results are Hama says 40k have been killed. As much as 50% women and children. However they estimate that about 15000 combatants were reported as civilians, finding many deaths happened before the water or mis categorized. They also say in a years time about 5,000 die annually when not at war. So the report estimates 40K-5k natural deaths-15k combatants=20k civilians have been killed in Gaza. My take is even if the top number is 45k that still means noon combatant deaths would be 25k a far cry from over 40k. Every death is a tragedy, but as wars go these numbers are actually the lowest as a percentage of any war since WWII.       I really hope Norway Spain and others wake up.

Pure propaganda. Families like that are extremely rare.

ec304vs,t3_a7dwly,"I appreciate the support from fellow believers. I have to say though, there seem to be a lot of sceptics for being on a site that is provided as a gathering place for non-sceptics. I understand, as I said, that not all MEs will be experienced by everyone. This, however, does not mean they aren't legitimate MEs for the one's that have experienced them. I didn't experience the one concerning Nelson Mandela, or Tank Boy, or Billy Graham, or plenty of others... That doesn't mean they aren't real for those who did, therefore I included them. 

As for the spelling MEs, I've seen enough myself to know that when a large number of people have reported the same alternate spelling, they're probably authentic. I know we are all fallible, that tends to be less true when large numbers of people have the same alternate memory. All of the MEs on this list have been reported and experienced by large numbers of people 

 Coming here to tell people that you KNOW the MEs some of us have experienced are wrong simply because YOU didn't experience them yourself is not what this subreddit is supposed to be about.",Sabina090705,,16,16,2018-12-19 01:19:43

(Also, it's apparently Tinker Bell, not Tinkerbell)

And regarding the ""You've been hit by, you've been struck by"" in Smooth Criminal.  
In the first part of the song he does sing ""hit by"" twice.  
But during the second part of the song he sings ""hit by"" then ""struck by"".  
So I think people get confused when they skip into the song and hear ""hit"" twice, but when the song ""loops"", then he does go ""hit by, struck by"" but most people miss that.  
I know this because it's something that's stuck with me since the 80's when I was a kid and tried to sing along.  
People always messed that part up, but I looked at the lyrics in a book I had and noticed that the song changes that part after it loops.  


And Mona Lisa has at least had a smile since the very early 80's.

My idea was, chartreuse *sounds* like a shade of red; most color words with a combination of ""c"", ""r"", and ""s"" consonant sounds and maybe an ""a"" vowel are shades of red. Crimson, carmine, scarlet, carbuncle, coral, cardinal, cinnabar, claret...I knew damn well what chartreuse was, but I figured I could screw with people who had no artistic training. And, well...here we are!

I can link to the archived post where I first did it, if anyone wants. I got called out for being too leading the way I phrased it, but my following attempts were more subtle. Mind you, I do not claim to be the first person to ever make the claim, I have found posts online dating back to May 2014 wondering why chartreuse was a yellow-green when they could have sworn it was red. But I suspect that the people saying that were, if not trolling like I was, honestly confused by the same factors I thought made it a good troll, because it's an obscure color that most people wouldn't have encountered often and because it *sounds* red.

I think that what ever is happening the people that are doing the changes are trying to change from the bible original prophecy’s.

All historical records now do not match any eclipse or lunar eclipse to writing records. 
That has lead to this

Mind you they say it’s just a theory. 

The island of Gibraltar no longer a island. This change alters humanity historical records from 1600 to now alters how normal human behavior was at the time due to new change of conflict between the Great Britain’s empire and the Catholics faith. Changes the interaction of Jews and the European people as whole this leads to change the subjects of sieges warfare. 
I do not how to even explain all of it other then your whole historical records have been so altered that they are not even close to once was.

Your list having some changes of the bible listed is commendable and fair from a lot of what other people have done the shear scope and scale of all 5000+ changes is not listed. 
I understand that many people hate the God of the Bible or the one he sent as Christ as the only son of God. I understand that many want the Mandela effects to be a good thing where each other and one could some how ascend to a higher plain , wavelength, or what ever. That I’m a relic of the past throwing crap on your bright l.e.d. Sun light day. Yet I’m not bringing this up to make you mad I’m only showing that this was written once before any of these changes took place in the bible and the book Enoch.

Did an alright enough job despite making several bizarre decision (Constantly calling up players who had no business being called up or insisting on sticking to his system) but deserves credit for beating Mexico 3 times and especially for recruiting certain players like Dest and Musah. 

He won’t go down as my favorite ever manager but I will remember him as an important person in our transition.",,,9,9,2022-12-14 00:33:05
j04cwtn,t3_zlagrf,"The goalposts always shift when we talk about GGG for some reason. Every accomplishment he has is described as “the bare minimum” and only losers who think it’s ok for our team to be mediocre think GGG has been good. The bare minimum when GGG got hired was to qualify for the World Cup, that was it, now all of a sudden it’s that the bare minimum was to qualify, win every domestic trophy, never lose to mexico and qualify for the group stage of the WC. If that were actually the bare minimum for the program then GGG wouldn’t be the most successful coach in the team’s history (statistically).

Sure he isn’t and wasn’t perfect, I’d give his whole tenure a 7/10 personally, but acting as if it hasn’t been a mostly positive endeavor is just being ignorant, imo.",boomf18,,45,45,2022-12-13 23:51:34
j05915h,t3_zlagrf,"I'd give him a 7 out of 10. He wasn't horrible, he wasn't great. He deserves some positives for winning GOld Cup and Nations League, he gets knocked down a few pegs cause of some disastrous results. World Cup rates as a 7 out of 10.",bossmt_2,,3,3,2022-12-14 03:55:43
j04evjy,t3_zlagrf,">Unfortunately, his ego got in his way. Much like his ever-present insistence on his ""system"",

You were so close but had to ruin it.

You praise him for changing the way the team played from the past bunker/counter style and then you immediately turn around and crap on his system which is......to not bunker/counter.

The ego thing is funny too. Why? Because he disciplined a insubordinate player? Riiiight.",Ok_Air_8631,,12,12,2022-12-14 00:05:47

-aroma and acid
-roast
-(you skip this one, but it's important) sweetness
-bitterness

The amount of water very much dictates how much of each of these gets extracted, not just how dilute the solution is. Other factors can increase the extraction without decreasing body: pressure, stirring, increased temperature.

Overall, I see eye to eye with you on much of this, just got those points.

There's usually a massive hype train that follows the World Cup and a great atmosphere that accompanies the tournament both at home and in the host nation. This has been replaced with growing moral resentment and a tepid atmosphere that has killed the interest of the casual fan.

This is purely anecdotal but we always set up work Fantasy Football leagues for the Prem and major International tournaments. We have an office of 300 and usually get at least 50 people signing up for the fantasy league. This year the Prem one has 54 participants, but the World Cup one only has 13.

j0uycx6,t3_zpq218,"I’ve been a fan of Mario since 2011 when he broke into the starting lineup at BVB and cemented his spot as the best academy player ever. He could do things in the Fubonaut that no other player could. He was the future of the club.

With Dortmund replacing the outgoing Kagawa with Reus changed that squad dynamic so much that that has never been repeated. Going anywhere close to the CL final hasn’t been repeated either.

I hate our club mgmt but they didn’t have a choice when Mario forced them to put a low release clause that Bayern happily triggered that winter in 2013 which broke all of our collective hearts and led Hummels to not sleep for a couple of nights.

That backstabbing SoB made around 8M at Bayern and our mgmt could have offered him that much given that he was going to be the face of our club. But he went around saying he wanted to play for Pep. And we all know how that turned out. 

Despite that, I kept wishing he’d return and join forces with Reus again. They did but Götze was no longer the same player. Not even close. He did maintain his ego though and refused to take a paycut even though he was the highest paid player in the squad. That’s twice that he’d been thankless to the club and fans who supported him throughout his career.

That WC goal was a tough pill to swallow all around and didn’t help that it was him who scored. A Bayern player not a Dortmund one. Argentina losing to Germany again….a repeat of 1990 when Jurgen Klinsmann dove like an Olympic gold medal winning champion to screw over Diego and co.

India on the other hand have mastered the art of winning every game besides the ones that matter. At this point, it's fucking hilarious.

As a country, India needs to get better about appreciating sport in general. The crowd for the final was atrocious. It didn't feel like cricket fans in attendance - just India fanatics who couldn't appreciate another team playing well.

Also, you can make a really strong case at this point that Australia is the better ODI team anyway and that the final was no fluke. They came to India and won the ODI series earlier this year (and we even had Hardik Pandya available for that series). And then followed it up and split the two games with us at the World Cup, winning the one that actually mattered. Over 5 matches **in India** in 2023, Australia prevailed 3-2.

kavmv9e,t3_184a9ru,"I am getting  amused by so much cry about  stadium environment and rather find It funny.I know it's more because of politics imo..

I would  recommend people to rewatch 2011 finals, the wankhede got totally silent  when Sachin got out and SL were exited as fuck..Virat was a youngster  then but he stitched  a important  partnership  with Gambir, during  the course of thier partnership  crowd did found  their voice but were silenced when Dilshan took the wicket of Kohli..You can watch it in highlights..Then Dhoni came and to his credit,  he started  positively , hit some boundaries..on the  other side  Gambir  was doing thing efficiently. With their partnership flourishing , a India win was becoming  more and more certain. This is when  Wankede became lively  and crowd found  thier voice   and atmosphere became electric..If we had in a position  to lose that match one sided like 2023 finals  , the wankede  crowd too would have gotten silent..

Fast forward  to 2023  the fans were totally  behind the home team when Aussiee were 47/3 and when  Head was struggling..But once the partnership  between him and Marnus ,it was becoming certain  that India  is gonna lose that too  one-sided. This is when the stadium crowd became silent and I can bet my life this would  have happened  In most the Indian grounds...infact even  the people watching cricket in a projector at my area became silent during  that partnership..Kids did got a little excited when review was taken against  labuchange but were disappointed quick.. 

I mean Indians  are emotionally attached to Cricket, we have seen the same with  BD fans as well...SO we  can just say anything what serves out thinking abyways..",Attacktitan92,,2,2,2023-11-26 20:12:33

Cummins had a great WC. So did India. Just that aussies turned up well for the game and executed better.

On part of the crowd, people targeting ahmedabad crowd and bigging up Wankhede or Eden. Those are the same places where Sachin was booed and stones were thrown and effigies were burnt.

People don't seem to understand that the local crowd in Ahmedabad was not there to watch the match. Every single hotel in Ahmedabad was booked for cricket. The people who showed up were ardent fans who could afford those tickets. Not your usual fans who are rabid in their support. Sure India needed those fans, but blaming the crowd is just a brainded analysis.

mj102hl,t3_1jg6are,"I'm not from the US, but looking at things from the outside, I think football has grown too fast in the US. You needed this humbling. Yes, MLS is improving. Yes, USMNT has stars. Yes, you're developing the youth and there's a promising new generation on the horizon. But I have this feeling that when the US started to make all these improvements and football went a bit more mainstream inside the country, people forgot where they came from.

I remember after the England game at the WC, people were saying the US could've won it if it wasn't for this and that, even though England looked a bit stronger. I also remember people spam the WC threads saying the US beat Morocco in a friendly even though it was against their C side and under their previous manager. I've also seen people saying that the US at minimum will reach the quarter finals in the next WC at home. 

And then you lose against a much weaker Panama side where now finally you were the favorites to win by quite a margin. Tbh, I thought it was going to be an easy win myself. Turns out, that ""star"" mentality has creeped into the squad and the fight is just not there.

I also follow basketball a bit. I like seeing the US play at the olympics precisely because while their team is the best on paper, ever since that humiliating exit at the Olympics, and with the creation of the redeem team, the US basketball team always gives it a 100% at the Olympics. You don't see much star mentality there.

Mbappe, you managed to meet expectations which i believed was almost impossible (given how mad people got). You're incredible and one of the smartest football players i know of, on and off the pitch. Griezmann, looks like those lost finals made a proper soldier out of you. Loved your drive. You managed to be decisive almost every game, despite playing average sometimes. You compensated with magnificent work in defense anyway. Giroud, you deserve this WC. You've been just as important as the 10 others. This success is on you. Benzema, please be happy for them. Kante, you're my favorite player. Today doesn't matter, you brought us here. Your smile endeared us all. Your joy was contagious. Everyone is a better man after enough exposure to you. We forget how flawed we are when we hear you talk. You make better people of us. You're like Sangoku. Pure heart. Bet you'd fly on that supersonic cloud too. Lloris, thank fuck you won it. You had won shit. Now you are a fucking world champion. That mistake was just you having a big heart :) You saved us every game, just be proud of what you did. Umtiti, Varane, that WC was built on your backs. Thank you for those performances, you gave your all for the win. As a CB, this is inspiring. Hernandez you're a cunt but you're our cunt. And definitely a great player. Looking forward to watch you with Atleti. Pavard you made us go crazy with that goal. You made France go 🔥. Congrats on the legend/meme status for decades to come. Didier... This mattered to me for you. You're astute, you're a good human, you are simple, generous, humble. You know your job well. You know what it takes to win games, leagues, cups. Your country can never thank you enough. You became an absolute legend today. We should all thrive to have a bit of you in us. The others 12, god knows we're here because of you too. You kept this team a family, you lived it without envy. You just wanted to help the team. Help the country. And so you did. This is the only moment in life were all the grown men around you are crying like little bitches and i love it. I will cherish this team and what it gave me til the end. what a beautiful summer.

Southgate gets a lot of flak, and his lack of subs till late/taking out Saka will draw criticism, but I think today he had it mostly right.

izpsz0f,t3_zi3ek8,"Southgate has taken this English team to new levels, But I think its time to step down and let someone else get a shot to inject some new ideas into the team.

Southgate has created a humble,  non toxic england team which would be one of the most liked teams if some of their fans could stop being wankers for 5 minutes, but I don't think he has that tactical prowess to shape the game into an England win. Agasint croatia and italy he panicked and went full defensive and against france he made terrible subs that took the wind out of englands momentum,  like subbing saka off and bringing grealish for 2 minutes? Sterling who barely trained all week was also brought on?

izpcs88,t3_zi3ek8,"Honestly other than disappointed we lost, I'm pretty happy with that. We arguably created more, and outplayed a very good France team over the 90 minutes. Obviously, it means nothing in terms of success - but I didn't really come into the game with high expectations, and I thought other than not scoring from open play we had a really good showing.

I think the ref definitely had a few calls, mainly against us that probably were fouls, though honestly I think the first penalty incident was probably outside the box anyway - and whilst he definitely didn't give Saka much leeway, I definitely don't think you can blame him for the loss.

At the end of the day, we didn't manage to score a single goal from open play in the game, and France did twice. Saka and Foden really impressed me, I think sticking with them either side of Kane is definitely the way forward - though I definitely wouldn't have subbed on Mount when chasing a goal - and I don't think I'd have brought on Sterling over Grealish at that point. But I've always been sceptical of his subs.

But yeah, disappointing result, but honestly I think it was a pretty creditable performance, especially given how frustrated I'd been by Southgate prior to the tournament with his tactical style and the constant 5ATB.

Upamecano and Hernandez are defensive liabilities imo. Idk if Deschamps is really going to give Saliba a chance this far into the KOs

It plays into the broader theme that France feel defensively fragile without Kanté 

The key to Morocco vs France will be in how Morocco deals with Mbappe/Griezmann and how the French try and break the compactness of the Moroccan defense

They will have to rely on Mbappés explosiveness or on Greizmann’s ball playing/Giroud’s aerial threat to have a chance

Now, I know what it is: Football IQ. France is still an amazing team despite missing players due to injury, but they just commit so many stupid fouls that they're their own worst enemy. If this same French team plays just as stupidly against Morocco, then Morocco might actually have a chance to win it. France did great gutting this on out, but if Deschamps has any sense, he'll be using this game as a cautionary tale in training so they're prepared for the semi-final.

As for England, they looked threatening most of the time, but couldn't convert outside of penalties. Shame, since Walker did a great job sewing Mbappe up and Saka was phenomenal.

I am a POC and went to a Trump rally. I had never felt so much friendliness in regards to folk who simply wanted to help their country. People of all colors, creeds, and religions were there and everyone helped each other out. 

I CANNOT say the same for any leftist-oriented event. Everyone was super judgy and on edge. If there was one thing that didn't subscribe to their playback, it was on SIGHT.

mbzra3a,t3_1ilvk4o,">Anyway the last 5 years or so when watching major media, social media (ESPECIALLY Reddit), etc… it became easy to feel like I was out of touch or I was losing my mind. 

There's a youtube video that brilliantly covers this feeling with a non-political hypothetical in the intro.

[Reddit is a Psy-Op](https://youtu.be/V7GtYaruTys) by Flesh Simulator.

At least watch the intro, if not the 'conspiracy theory'.

>15 years ago I would have said I was a liberal no question. 

Same.  I started paying more attention in 2016.  Seeing all the claims on Trump were just too much, I thought, ""Surely, no one man could be so...."" and plain enough, when I looked up what was actually said or done, it was always a lot less than the claim, when the claim wasn't a total fabrication.

My vindication is how far they've devolved from then, the mass hysteria and performative accusations have only grown in intensity.  A fascist/nazi under every bed, lurking in every shadow, death threats, assassination attempts(plural).

It's all so absurd, yet it happens all day, every day.

I didn't need crowds to let me know there are sane people out there(nice to see the confidence in people to voice opinions though), but the crazy people continually doubling down while I sit here more or less the same.

That's what lends me confidence.

Lozano looked so dangerous. With Germany slowly building up possession and supporting it with their fullbacks moving forward I felt like this exposed the centre backs far too much. Germany’s midfield were also far too slow at tracking back. Hernandez’s movement is good, but once he’s made the space and received the ball, he was just far too wasteful. Mexico could/should have done more damage.


Reus was a good sub from Germany actually injected a lot of energy into the German attacks, which was important as for the large parts Germany were playing in front of Mexico too much, which Mexico were happy with to trust Ochoa from range and restrict the space in behind. Reus looked to get into the tiny spaces behind the defence from wide giving them a more direct output. 

Low for me was a bit too slow with his changes too. Reus on was the right decision, but I think they had to throw Gómez on a bit earlier considering how many times they’d get out wide and be left without an idea. I do disagree with the Germany miss Sane comments. He hasn’t really performed for Germany, Reus did well when he came on.

e0tr7ge,t3_8rsa1g,"Really impressed by Mexico today, they weren't overawed by the occasion, didn't panic, they just sat deep, looked to prevent the Germans from slicing their defense open and then played direct passes into Chicarito, Vela and Lozano. Vela did pretty well, he's not just playing as a forward here but also a playmaker and even as a 'blocker', preventing Kroos from doing much with the ball. 

Lozano excites me the most though, when he was running forward on the counter you just felt *something* was going to happen, his electric pace and tenacity was a treat to see. They also posed a decent threat from set-pieces. IMO, this is the perfect template for beating a technically superior side. Only flaw were the heavy touches and subpar passing from the attackers, especially Chicarito, they could have been 3-0 or 4-0 up otherwise. I didn't agree with Osorio's subs however, I think keeping at least Lozano on would have helped provide an better outlet for when Mexico parked the bus. Layun may be fast enough, but he's not a forward.

Germany have been surprisingly naive today. Maybe it's not too surprising because they're usually due a bad performance in the group stages, but Kimmich was constantly getting forward and ignoring his defensive duties, and I counted at least 5 counters starting from his side -- 3 by Lozano, 1 by Vela and even 1 by Chicarito, and that's only acceptable if you're a massive attacking threat in exchange. However, he only created a couple of chances in attack, so it clearly wasn't a good trade-off. To sum up how bad it was, for Lozano's goal, Ozil, a no. 10, had to defend his zone.

Kroos wasn't impressive either, he was usually the deepest midfielder but didn't have the mobility or defensive nous to stop a counter; in the first half alone he got dribbled past 6 times. Germany's vulnerability to counters isn't something new (remember Algeria?) but tonight was just shocking. Kimmich either needs to time his runs better, or they need a DM to sit beside Kroos and cover the gaps that appear.",ebilutionist,,186,186,2018-06-17 16:51:25

It hurts that we will not be together with family and friends to scream all united from the bottom of our hearts ""Italia Italia"" without disturbing our neighbor because he's screaming too with his family and friends.
It hurts to see a stadium full of families and young children all wrapped up in italian's flags who sang and screamed for 90 minutes walk out looking sad at the ground lost in a world of pain
It hurts watching Captain Buffon cry, always our pride, watching De Rossi scream from the bench to let someone better and more offensive then him play because we need to win, watching the team knowing that the next time the will not be someone like Barzagli to help us defend.
A game hurts us, yes a game that still gives us emotions

dps11dx,t3_7cqjmc,"As I said in another thread. Ventura was complete shit from start to end.

The 3-5-2 was completely uneffective

From starters, Barzagli and Chiellini were playing almost as wing backs and this caused so many issues I don't even know where to start

- Offensively, both are less effective than let's say Florenzi and Darmian 

- Defensively, since both were so high up in the field, it left Bonucci alone in a counter attack with two not so fast defenders running late

- Using 3 defenders against a team that would play so defensively doesn't make any sense. Not now, not in the past, not never

- playing  this way they had a midfield with Darmian, Florenzi, Parolo, Jorginho and Candreva. Florenzi is highly more effective while playing on the side. 

- If the goal was to cross the ball every time it went to attack, having two good passing defensive midfielders would've been best. They could cover while the defenders were up against the tall Swedish defense. Plus they would distribute the ball way better than Chiellini, Bonucci and Barzagli did

- Insigne on the bench

- Belotti on the bench

- Marchisio on the bench

- El Shaarawy on the bench

- Candreva starting the game

- Parolo starting the game

- Gabbiadini starting the game

Just because everyone's *saying* you're the one to beat, doesn't mean you need to prove anything to anyone.

No ones going to give him the space he needs to really turn it on, he's got to get rid of the ball faster and move into whatever space he can find after that.

Holding on to it with three defenders around you and trying to dribble through/around them is just not going to work. Getting the foul is nice but you lose all the momentum everytime you do that unless the FK is by by box and your opponent gets a chance to reset. ",fiver420,,89,89,2018-06-17 20:00:26

do4e0ez,t3_7598na,"Can we talk about the shitty seeding procedure, please?

FIFA Ranking is already dogshit under normal circumstances. France did not face normal circumstances, though. 

Being the host of 2016 Euro they were automatically qualified. Being qualified means only friendly matches during the Euro Qualifiers. Since playing (nothing but) friendly matches (regardless of win or loss) will lead to a nation plummeting in FIFA rankings they were on #22 of the seeding list. 

This of course meant they would be drawn to one of the ""top"" teams from pot 1.  

This should never ever happen for a team as strong as France during that time. I'm really surprised how Italy ended up in pot 2 (didn't follow them closely) but France being in pot 2 was a result of them hosting the Euro.

How the terribly flawed FIFA rankings (and the friendly problem has been exploited quite frequently over the past couple of years) are still a thing instead of receiving a major overhaul is beyond me.",Sturmstreik,,175,175,2017-10-09 14:33:43

Also, Khedira has always played a more defesive role for the NT than at club level and we´ve been fine that way, the problem is rahter the replacement - Gündogan isn´t a defensive minded player as mentioned and if Goretzka can put in some steel if needed at this level has to be seen.

Lastly, the ""Mannschaft"" thing is so goddam awful that it´s close to unfathomable, especially when the ""foreign"" press already have their own ways to nickname this team (Panzer, Machine etc.) and no one in Germany calls them ""Mannschaft"".

dzq5mai,t3_8mqeor,"Great post overall, just a few things I would personally disagree with:

- I think you're being a bit harsh identifying Kimmich as a point of weakness in the team. While he does have some defensive weaknesses, he's honestly one of the best right backs in the world overall and his defensive weakness is only in comparison to his attacking threat (and is also a symptom of a Bayern system involving highly aggressive full backs). It's a bit like saying Marcelo is a weakness in the Brazil team for having a similar playing style - while it's technically true, it doesn't consider the massive benefits that the playing style brings to the team.

- I think you're overrating Reus a little. He's a wonderful player and I'm genuinely excited to see him finally fit for a major tournament, but saying that he's ""maybe Germany's most talented outfield player"" and ""no one would fancy Sane over Reus"" seems to be exaggeration to me. I think Reus should start (over Oezil, in my personal opinion), but I'm not sure his inclusion in the XI would be quite as obvious as you make it out to be.",,,14,14,2018-05-28 20:45:13

The thread does identify the real Achilles heel of the German team: They don't have true holding/defensive midfielders. Contrary to 2014, when Khedira and Schweinsteiger made for a pairing strong in defensive skills, Germany now let Kroos play deep often pairing him with another playmaking midfielder like Gündogan or Goretzka. That made Germany even better in ""designing"" offensive plays but a stronger opponent ""taking the fight to them"" can expose them defensively. ",HipHobbes,,8,8,2018-05-28 15:09:12

I'm 100% sure Hector will play on a world class level for Germany this WC.

I cross my fingers and hope that Reus doesn't get injured. A man of his experience and quality deserves to finally show his skills on the big stage for our country.
Can would've been the perfect addition to this squad but since he won't make it, we have to trust in Khedira to make things work. I could see Goretzka doing well as a holding midfielder next to Kroos, but then again that's not up to me to decide.
I also believe that Löw deserves a lot of praise for turning us back into a dominant football nation. He does receive a lot of shit because of favoritism of certain players or questionable experiments (Mustafi, Can, Rudy on RB) but his success is undeniable.
Going into this tourney, I expect us to reach at least the Semis. Once you're at the Semis, the quality will be so high that small factors will be deciding games.

One thing to note is that the team [hired a few Spanish coaches](http://mengnews.joins.com/view.aspx?aid=3046842) as part of the staff, including assistant coach Toni Grande, who was Vicente del Bosque's assistant during that manager's time at Real and Spain.

Since our defense is crap, our best chances of progressing into the knockout rounds is to attack and somehow score more than Germany, Mexico, and Sweden do in our matches. Which will be hard to do since we've been hit with so many injuries (attackers Kwon Chang-hoon, Yeom Ki-hun, and Lee Keun-ho are out, as is defender Kim Min-jae - Kim Jin-su is also a doubt).

I guess one additional concern to add for the korean national team is that prior to the competition, injuries to major players such as Lee Geun Ho, Kwon Chang Hoon, and Kim Min Jae have already crippled the already weak and fatigued team.

dzvx9bj,t3_8nik3e,"The main problem with Korean football is that they opt for a more physical style of football - tall attackers who can hold their feet (Kim Shin-Wook, who I believe Shin sees as Emile Heskey reincarnate), followed by pacy poachers who pose as their main goalscoring threat (Son) - which bodes well against fellow Asian countries but holds zero chance of competitiveness internationally. Koreans know this and have been trying to implement a more Spanish approach (*a la Tiki-Taka*) but results have failed.

The fact that Korea’s first match is against Sweden is worrisome. If both countries employ tough aggressive football, the Swedes will undoubtedly dominate. And that is the reason that the injury of Kwon Chang-Hoon, a Dijon winger with 11 goals this season that Koreans hoped would provide a spark of creativity missing in its national team, comes as a fatal blow to our chances.

e0budz4,t3_8nik3e,"Really informative write\-up, good job to the two authors.

I'm just going to address the tactical part really quickly, as I didn't see anybody here addressing it properly.

The reason our manager is so insistent on preparing a 3\-man back in a 3\-4\-1\-2 is because our first opponent, Sweden, is nearly certain to come out in the 4\-4\-2 they've been playing for awhile. Tactically, the best way to neutralize a 2\-man strike force is to deploy a 3\-man or a 5\-man backline. The simple theory is that a 3\-man back should theoretically have a 1\-man advantage on a 2\-man strike force.

That's why our manager is insisting on a 3\-4\-1\-2, it's because the 3\-man back is considered a stronger system to counter a 4\-4\-2, compared to using a 4\-man back with only 2 CBs. 

In contrast, Germany generally uses a 4\-2\-3\-1, and Mexico usually a 4\-3\-3 or a 4\-2\-3\-1, although sometimes a 4\-4\-2 as well. For these teams that use a 1\-man strike force primarily, a 4\-man back with 2 CBs is considered the best way to neutralize them. 

Therefore, you will likely see Korea play a 4\-4\-2 against Mexico and Germany.

If you enjoyed the simple tactical analysis above, come check out a blog on the Korea national team that I contribute to, called the Tavern of the Taegeuk Warriors. The website's at [TaegukWarriors.com](https://TaegukWarriors.com), and we're also active on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. I can also be found on r/KLeague, and sometimes on BigSoccer Korea. ",ironcub14,,1,1,2018-06-08 14:28:00
e0nna33,t3_8nik3e,"The 4-4-2 formation looks really off. Why would Jang Hyun Soo play at RB and not CB? It will be Lee Yong who will play there. Also there is no way Lee Jae Sung and Ki get paired together in center midfield. Lee Jae Sung will most likely get shifted to one of the wings while Jung Woo Young likely comes inside to pair up with Ki in center midfield. 

Also, it's not like we turned down Şenol Güneş out of choice or incompetence. First, our budget is so that we can only offer managers a maximum of $1 million per year. It's highly likely Şenol Güneş' demands were higher. Add that to the fact that with little less than a year left until the world cup appointing a foreign manager would not really have been ideal since getting to know the team and getting comfortable with the system alone would have taken a long time.

And the rest of them, Honduras is worse, Jamaica is worse, even Panama's worse and only qualified because everyone else declined even harder. Mexico is basically the only big team that's even held steady, and I guess Canada has some promise for the future. All in all though I'm not happy with this region at all.

England do the basics well, the main thing for me is creating good link up for Kane. Sterling has been instrumental the last two tournaments in stretching defence, hopefully will continue

Where england have lost it is against midfield strong teams with excellent suffocating possession. Rice and Phillips can defend well but over a game will cede ground. So it'll be interesting to see what Bellingham does

Now it's going to be mulled wine, a fireplace and a crippling ennui over yet another talented England team playing some of the most insipid football around. 

With a 26 man squad to announce, it does give us a little more room for experimentation though. We won't do that, but in theory we could. 

Having said that, I'd be surprised if we don't see largely the squad everyone expects. One silver lining of injuries though, is it means we get further away from Gareth's only RBs dream. 

Would probably take:

GK: Pickford, Ramsdale, Henderson 

RB: TAA, Trippier 

CB: Dier, Stones, Maguire, White, Tomori

LB: Shaw, Chilwell

CM: Bellingham, Rice, Henderson, Phillips

AM: Foden, Mount

W: Saka, Grealish, Sterling, Rashford, Bowen

ST: Kane, Toney, ?

Walker, James

Those are rookie numbers, we fairly recently had 5 presidents in 10 days, get on our level!

Honestly, my main takeaway from all the TAA, Reece James, Walker debates is that I'm incredibly jealous of how much RB depth England has, it's by far our worst position. We get one injury and we're fucked.

I'm not sure what to expect from England tbh. They did do very well in their last 2 tournaments and they have a ton of talent, but they seem to get worse each match. I'm not considering them one of the out and out favorites like Brazil but Southgate, despite not playing particularly pretty football, has done well enough in tournaments that I wouldn't count them out (to go far, not to win, obviously, it's still England at the end of the day).",lcmrdp,,27,27,2022-10-23 11:43:28

This is often said on /r/soccer but I don't think it's particularly true. Southgate's been perfectly willing to give players a chance in 'easier' games and reward them if they do well. Saka went from being barely making the squad at the start of the Euros, putting in an impressive shift in a dead rubber against the Czechs, and because of that ended up being a key player in the knockouts.

I wouldn't be surprised if someone like Chilwell, or even JWP, put in a solid performance in a group stage game and found their way into the starting XI later on.",SouthWalesImp,,6,6,2022-10-23 16:44:31

You likely will have the same management first off, and as strange as it sounds you cannot be as motivated as you are the first time around. Managers are praised for any success at all, but sustaining it is so so hard. Whatever motivational tactics you used the first time can not be repeated with the same success. Can you recreate yourself and/or the team again and again? Probably not. But outside there are many teams that are just hungrier and fresher then you can be.

Plus I think a country’s general morale and state of their football governing body can be important, but there is so much drama and nonsense clouding France this year. I think they are in trouble.",DogTheGayFish,,44,44,2022-11-07 15:35:52

Sadly we don't have 3 midfielders. Kante and Pogba are dead, fuck Guendouzi and Rabiot, Camavinga and Tchouameni can double pivot but I don't think the creativity will be there. At this point trying out Dembele as a 10 may not be a terrible idea because at least he can feed Benzema and Mbappe. Coman has been good at RWB for us but he's injury prone, I feel like Clauss can either make or break the team.

Biggest issue is the defense. Kimpembe has a fuck up him, Varane fell off since 2018, Upamecano is hot trash everytime he plays for France, Lucas is injured, and Deschamps don't trust Konate / Mukiele.",,,18,18,2022-11-07 15:36:14

Areola, Lafont, Saliba, Upamecano, Kimpembe, Clauss, Digne, Coman, Y Fofana, Guendouzi, Camavinga, Nkunku, O Dembele, Ben Yedder, Giroud  


I think Giroud, Kamara, and Digne are the biggest doubts. Giroud's place could go to Kolo-Muani or Diaby, Fofana's place could go to Kamara or Veretout, and Digne's could go to Mendy. Hard to say. I think Kamara and Fofana are essentially in a straight shoot-out. Guendouzi will go, though.

The only issue is he and Benzema don't seem to play well together. Sometimes sharing the same space 

I remember in some of the Nations League games, Mbappe would have the ball on the left but there was no one in the middle to link up with or cross to, because both Benz and Antoine drop too deep. Nkunku looked bright when he played.

Midfield took a hard downgrade compared to 2018. No Pogba means France aren't contenders anymore imo. He's far too important. No one else there has his absurd passing range among his other qualities.

Defence is solid except for right side. For some reason Kounde and Upamecano do not look good for France. No Maignan is a miss. Hopefully Lloris is still soild 4 years later.",KryptonianCode,,4,4,2022-11-07 19:39:47

I don’t think we are favorites tbh as much as people think we are. We lost Kante and Pogba who are our best two midfielders by far and made Deschamps system tick like clockwork. Do we have talented plays to replace them like Camavinga and Tchouameni? Sure but they haven’t exactly performed at their level so far and not just them. We been playing a 3 at the back system so far and we been struggling tbh. Our defense is the main concern. It looks so vulnerable. And we have so many players that don’t perform for the national team right now like Koundé, Upamecano. Saliba hasn’t been at his best like he is with Arsenal. Konate is injured but I would have loved to have him as his partner. Badashile has been solid so far on his debut game so I’m excited for him. Midfield has no creativity without Guendouzi in it tbh. Hence why we miss Pogba the most. Griezmann is a shadow of his former self so far and Nkunku has performed better but still not quite up to par yet. Hopefully Benzema gets healthy before the World Cup. Also with playing this 3 at the back system we would need Theo Hernandez but for now we have Coman or Rabiot playing there who are alright but not been amazing.

Overall I think we will get out of groups probably but I don’t think we will have a deep run this time and will struggle unfortunately. Mbappé is great but tries too much to do on his own. When he plays with his teammates he can be unstoppable.",ThatFrenchCray,,9,9,2022-11-07 20:41:25

If Griezmann is used as a 10 again, that means Mbappe will play off the wing or in a partnership with Benzema. While lethal, I think their shape at the last World Cup was better, Matuidi was used as a shuttler off the left and Giroud played as a poacher, occupying the space between opposing CBs which allowed  Griezmann to playmake and gave Mbappe the chance to expose the spaces.

Benzema is world class, don’t get me wrong. But I do wonder if having and Griezmann on the field together will be an issue since they like to occupy similar spaces.",insicur,,-5,-5,2022-11-07 16:47:59

The Ronaldo situation is also predictable, for some time now its obvious that the rest of the squad feels the pressure to try and make the man shine again.

Personally I think this year could be the outlier, especially since there's no group of death and no clear ""How did we get ranked so high?""(Although Portugal should be considered here imo, with Ronaldo underperforming). Also Netherlands, one of the likely candidates, should be safe thanks to Mané's injury.

Well I mean this was literally never possible since they changed the way the pots were organised and groups are drawn in 2018. Unless you're referring to ELO ranking


The pots were ordered in terms of FIFA World Ranking (aside from the host who are put into pot 1), , so in every group there's gonna be just two teams, no more and no less, that are in the top 16 of the qualified teams.


Prior to 2018, the pots weren't decided by FIFA ranking outside of Pot 1 but I think something like geographic separation. It was less organised",,,5,5,2022-11-19 16:27:51

He finally was having a very decent season for Torino in 2021/22 after years of inconsistence, good enough to even start some UNL games in the summer. 

Torino also agreed with Wolfsburg €10m fee to permanently sign him but he suddenly stopped the negotiation probably thinking he was good enough to play for a better team. Consequences:

- No important team tried to sign him in the summer

- Benchwarming at Wolfsburg.

- Not called for the WC 2022.

Pretty much the anti-Vlasic (who, after a mediocre year at West Ham where he started only 6 PL games, was benched by Brekalo in the summer's UNL games so run away from WHU to join Torino for gametime and now he looks one of most inform Croatian players.

Once again we have godlike midfield (top 3 in the world imo, but I am a lot biased) ;).

I would say we even improved defense, we have a lot of young talented players in the back. My only worry is they are still inexperienced, but hopefully it will be ok.

We also changed GK. If enemy has counter, Livaković against anyone 1v1, he is one of the best we can have. However stuff like corners could be problematic.

And now forward. Mandžukić pleaaaaaase come back, I beg you. We are just missing one Halandić to be top team.

Group is not easy, Belgium is top tier team (actually wanted Croatia Belgium final last WC, Modrić vs De Bruyne). So it will be great game that could go either way. Also Morocco and Canada, countries with some great players. Hopefully we should be able to beat them and advance. And in knockout everything is possible.

If you are looking for a dark horse for this WC, Croatia will be it. We are not favorites to win, but no team will have easy time against us.

ivy0poe,t3_ys8ejz,"
The deepest squad we ever had, wealth of player and tactical options on a level we never had. Both the 2018 and 1998 squads were paper thin with huge dropoffs between the first XI and the subs.

Juranović-Šutalo-Gvardiol-Sosa is a lineup people may not be familiar with now, but it’s almost guranteed they all play for bigger clubs in about a year. That’s why Lovren (who index.hr predict to start 💀) should be nowhere near the field.

Petko is in great form, best since 2019, I could see him start ahead of the other guys. 

For fantasy/betting players, if Pašalić is likely to start, he is a great goalscorer pick. He is actually the player with the most goals for the NT in the last two years, and he always finds himself at the right place at the right time.

Midfield 3 is the best in the world, come at me.

My prediction: A dramatic round of 16 exit, but we’ll play some great football along the way.",,,20,20,2022-11-11 13:35:24

ivy05uk,t3_ys8ejz,"Great read. 

Concerning the possible squad:

Livaković, Gvardiol, Sosa, Juranović, Brozović, Modrić, Kovačić, Perišić are definite locks. I just hope Gvardiol is 100% ready for the first game (concerning his recent injury). 

The second CB is up for debate and honestly it's a 50/50 tossup between Šutalo and Erlić. I'm definitely leaning a bit more on the Erlić side even though I believe Šutalo is the better player. Šutalo made some crucial mistakes in the last Nations League cycle (Eriksen banger) and CL cycle with Dinamo. Erlić just feels more confident to me. 

In our attack only one thing is actually for sure: Perišić has to play. He's our joker, our tournament player and our main offensive outlet. This of course means that we will play the usual 4-1-4-1 formation with Modrić-Kovačić in the centre, two wings (Perišić on the left) and a number 9 up front. 

In this mentioned formation we need to fill the striker and right wing positions. For the striker, knowing Dalić, it's probably going to be Budimir (unfortunately). I agree with you in how I'd much prefer Livaja in the position. Petković is not a number 9 and he best works as a false 9 (or theoretically a number 10/SS with Livaja up front, which would be a dream-come-true for us HNL fans). For the RW, there are several options. Either it's Pašalić (more offensive approach), Majer (more defensive/playmaker approach) or even Perišić (he can play right and in that case Oršić plays left. This means a bit less offensive output on the left but more on the right, makes it more balanced).

ivy0iru,t3_ys8ejz,"Honestly I feel like Antonio Mirko Čolak was shafted for this world cup. To be selected over Budimir was probably my only gripe with Dalic’s 26 man selection and mainly because we lack any power upfront. Budimir was decent for Osasuna last season but now he’s not at any kind of good form, especially Kramarić, as he’s being more of a winger play than a striker these days. We are going to have a real problem with Kramarić, Budimir, and Livaja. Livaja seems more of the build up/assist guy type than a striker in my opinion. We really rely heavily on Perišič and Modrić to be the combination in our goal tally. I hope Dalić plays Pašalić and Oršič. I feel like Oršić should be played forward in the starting 11 rather than Kramarić, Budimir or Livaja. I really hope they step up their game.

I see that you're just repeating what the article you linked to is telling you, but I feel the need to make a PSA that if someone is having a seizure there is NO need to make sure they don't swallow their tongue, choke on their tongue, anything like that. *Don't stick your hands or other objects into the mouth of someone having a seizure*. Really the only reason you should touch them is to remove them from a dangerous situation, or if a medical professional or 911 operator tell you to. Best case scenario you don't do anything helpful, **worst case scenario you cause them to choke on whatever you put in their mouth and they die**. Your tongue is meant to be inside your mouth! You can't choke on it and your body isn't able to swallow it unless you have some sort of extremely abnormal physiology.

Indeed the stakes of the world cup were huge for France, they had an incredible team, Zidane was blooming into a star player (won the ballon d'or this year) and the expectations and enthusiasm lf the French peiple were huge. 
But there have been many controversies surrounding this WC, and evidence of shady things can be found. Platini confessed 20 years later that they did some shenanigans to arrange the group stage draw so that France would only meet Brazil in the finale if they were both firstof their groups. Petit, who scored the 3rd goal of the finale, has also been suspicious of the whole tournament, and raised the possibility that shady arrangements took place behind the scenes. That is just on top of my head (and to be fair, the world of football is sadly ridden with these scandals), but a lot can be said about this tournament, which was very intense nonetheless.",Imtf_,,32,32,2023-01-12 17:27:48

but honestly, one people on whom i wish i saw more write ups on, is Gabriel Batistuta. in the old days where i used to play FIFA in our PC , he was my star striker , and i couldnt find Messi in the squad. i was a fan of that guy and honestly, kinda forgot about him for a while.

now recently i saw a random post about Drax and Bautista the wrestler (whose name i remembered by the Wrestler/Cricket cards using which i used to play as a child) , a name which reminded me of Gabriel Batistuta the star striker of Argentina , and goddamn looking into who the guy was has given me massive amounts of respect for the man. watching this handsome man's tears of joy on argentina winning the world cup - i cant believe i ever forgot about this guy and his passion for football , and blame myself for this travesty.

The fact is, both the rise to notoriety and the fall from the top spot are the results of some of these impactful moments, and it's kind of impossible to talk about hypothetically higher peaks that could have been reached. For every ""injury that changed everything for the worse"", there's a ""goal that changed everything for the better"". Picking and choosing a player's experience to only keep the best and imagine a theoretical peak is kind of pointless and is ultimately not doing the player any favors.

R9 had the best career he could have and it's a hell of a beautiful one. Like most, it's made of ups and downs, and certainly wouldn't be as admirable if it was just a boring line going up up up. Embrace the swinging nature of sports and honor the players' accomplishments instead of lamenting missed potential.

But one look at Ronaldo during the lineup/handshakes  said it all. and when game underway it just confirmed it. It also had a massive impact on the rest of the Brazilian team who just seemed lost especially in midfield/attack.

So if you were to swap Slovenia from one to the other, you would get 241.2M and 240M, a slimer difference than the final one.

While I'm aware that preferences may vary, I personally have two changes I want to mention.
(1) The populations being balanced is a good principle, but I don't think it's necessary to adhere to it too strictly. In the West Mainland Europe team, the inclusion of Slovenia and Hungary cannot be justified for any logical reason other than trying to balance the population. 
I think you should have given yourself a little more leeway there. After all, your idea, your rules.

From what I’m hearing our NT players not only fully support Bento but also believe in and have bought into the system he has put in place (people who have played high level football know that buying into a coach’s philosophy is super important as a team). Korea lost a legend in the past year and our players are known to be gritty and scrappy so here’s to hoping for a great result in groups.


Also, I am firmly in the belief that Oh Hyun Gyu should not have been picked. His finishing is extremely suspect.

Just compared to the last WC we have a more mature squad, a better coach (one that can actually motivate players), slightly better midfield, better offence, and the recent successes to motivate us (first in wc qual group above Portugal, first in our NL group above Norway, both after last day wins against those two teams).

Why i'm very cautious about it after all that? Because we here tend to hype up our sports teams a lot and that may backfire. Also, i fear that we are underestimating Cameroon and that they will be hard to win against.

Also, there's a few players i think might be in the starting lineups instead of the 11 mentioned above: S.Mitrovic instead of Veljkovic or Pavlovic, Lazovic instead of Zivkovic and Gudelj instead of Lukic. It might depend a lot on our opponents whether any of those three will start a game since they all have been somewhat regular starters and even important players in the last two years.

All in all, i would be slightly to moderately disappointed if we crash out in the group, depending on the way it happens and i also don't see us going further than the quarter finals at best. But as they say, the ball is round, and anything can happen.",neman-bs,,25,25,2022-11-14 15:44:13

iwc7z4j,t3_yux80n,"Brilliant preview, u/daniloelnino. Thanks for providing background on a national team not well-known outside of Europe.

The Serbia vs Switzerland 2018 WC game was one of the most exciting in the tournament (for reasons beyond football). But this time I really think Serbia will get their revenge against Switzerland and qualify for the second round to play one of Portugal or Uruguay. It's a hopeful squad filled with experience and players in their prime and Switzerland are overdue a generational change.",Montuvito_G,,24,24,2022-11-14 15:55:26
iwd0bln,t3_yux80n,"Croatia with an amazing looking defense and shaky offense.

Serbia with an amazing looking offense and shaky defense.

First time in my lifetime seeing this to be honest. It's always been the other way around - we used to have great individual strikers such as Šuker, Pršo, Kranjčar, Olić, Dudu, Mandžukić and our defense was always the weakest link, while the Serbs used to have a stellar defense but lacked in offense. 

The Serb offense this time round is just... incredible... **on paper**. And that's my issue to be honest. On paper Serbia always has an amazing team... and then they'll go and fail the EURO qualifiers for the 7th time in a row... or exit in the group stages at the WC.

I expect Mitrović to be the star player, not Vlahović. I am honestly not convinced by Vlahović so far. Sure, he looked amazing, some people (IMO undeservedly) were even comparing him to Haaland for a little while, but the Juventus move really killed him. I really hope he starts working and he does it fast because Serbia absolutely needs him.

I can **easily** see Serbia making it through this group. Brazil of course is expected to top the group but I can see Serbia taking second place ahead of Switzerland and Cameroon. Switzerland is always dangerous (just ask Italy) but I feel like they're worse than the EUROs. Cameroon just feels... off.

Lots of good players who are either injured (Mitro/Vlahovic) or going through a bad patch of form at the moment (like Kostic), an average defence who conceded the third most goals in the WCQ (worse than Ireland) and ofc the Serbian tendency to implode at the biggest stage (as OP mentioned).

SMS (while I love him as a player) hasn't really performed at the highest level, having disappointed in both the international tournaments he's played so far. I'm curious to see whether now, at 27, he'll really perform to the peak of his abilities and drag this team past the group stage.

- Sarpreet Singh, CAM: One of NZ's hottest talents at the moment. Currently playing in the reserves for Bayern munich, making 1 first team appearance as a sub in the bundesliga earlier this year. 

- Liberato Cacace, LWB: Another future star for NZ. Still playing for his hometown team 'Wellington Phoenix' (the lone professional club of NZ) this kid is on track to be player of the season in the A-League. Still only 19 years old, he has gained attention from clubs such as leeds and Liverpool, some even quoting him to be the ""next Andy Robertson""

- Roy Krishna, ST: This man is the pride of Fiji, probably the best non-NZ player in OFC right now. He has recently played his career for ATK in India winning the championship and was equal-top scorer. In the previous year he was player of the season and golden boot winner in the A-League.

fn3egi8,t3_fz1b0a,"First World Cup final I remember watching was 2002. I think I was supporting Brazil because they were ""the best"" and I thought it would be disgraceful if the country we had battered 5-1 away got their hands on the World Cup instead of the country that knocked England out. I seem to remember Kahn keeping Germany in the game for an hour then throwing it away.

Favourite final would be 2006. The two teams were way more evenly matched than in any of the other finals I've seen and both teams had had incredible journeys to the final. A pretty cagey game all round but still enjoyable and obviously Zidane headbutting Materazzi in extra time spiced up the entire thing. 

Most controversial incident - hard to decide between Zidane's headbutt and De Jong's studs up kick to the chest. I'd probably go with De Jong since he wasn't even sent off. In terms of previous World Cup finals it's probably' Hursts's winning goal.

Best goal I've seen is probably Gotze's. He has very little space and the cross is at a pretty shit height but he chests it up and hits it with his weak foot too quickly for Romero to react. Very audacious attempt and I don't think Romero was expecting it at all. From older World Cups it's got to be Carlos Alberto's in 1970. Winning the ball back, building up from the back, involved almost the entire team, four men get dribbled past and the captain charging in from right back to smash it in. 

Best individual performance probably Materazzi for equalising in the first half, wining Zidane up and converting his pen in the shootout. I feel like out of all the players I've seen at a World Cup he's the one who had the most outsized influence on the result relative to the expectation and the rest of his team. All time probably Maradona in 1986 or Hurst in 1966.

I don't think any of the matches I saw were really upsets. Most of them had the favourites winning and 2006 they were fairly evenly matched although I think France were slight favourites? All time I'd probably say 1950, Brazil had crushed Sweden and Spain in the second group stage while Uruguay scored late goals to get a draw and a narrow win. Brazil were to play an exhibition coronation in front of 200,000 Brazilians packed into the brand new Maracana and all they needed to do was not lose the game.

Edit: Least favourite final probably 2018. After what had been an incredible tournament with tonnes of upsets, comebacks and fairly evenly contested matches France just sort of ran away with it. It was enjoyable watching a team like that play so well but there was no real tension and it was against a clear underdog  who'd played three consecutive 120 minute matches.",twersx,,11,11,2020-04-11 15:31:03

Ribery, Malouda and Henry were all making great runs and Zidane was, well, Zidane. He could make a routine 5 yard pass look beautiful.

But there weren't a whole lot of chances for one reason really; Cannavaro was everywhere. There were several occasions a chance was coming and he just snuffed it out. Thuram at the other end was similarly rock like, but he didn't have to deal with as much.

2006 is my favourite. It was the most entertaining out of all the final's in the 21st century and very even with it being fully in the balance right until the end. Least favourite is 2018, although there was plenty of goals, the match was never really in the balance and France never looked like losing. I prefer matches that are close and go either and you don't know who's going to win.

England winning in 1966 with a goal that didn't cross the line and another goal that should have been disallowed (people on the pitch)

 **What was the best goal of all time in a World Cup Final?**

The Pele goal against Sweden in, I think 1958.

 **What was the best individual performance of all time in a World Cup Final?**

Probably Pele in that aformentioned 1958 Final.

Obviously Zidane was at the end of his career but they also had Henry, Makelele, Thuram, Gallas, Abidal, Viera, Malouda.

2018 has to be the best final I saw live, simply because it actually had goals. I really cannot remember much about 2010 and 2014 finals

Biggest upset of all time? Between 1950, 1954 and 1974. In 1950 the Brazillians basically assumed they had already won, 1954 was one of the greatest teams of all time, who were on a huge unbeaten run and had beaten West Germany 8-3 in the groups, 1974 is a similar story, the Dutch and Total Football looked unbeatable until it was.

fn2s7ph,t3_fz1b0a,"> What was the best goal of all time in a World Cup Final?

I genuinely can't look beyond [*that* Götze goal in 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_guXT4I-AQ). It's absolutely astounding!

We're 112 minutes into an extremely tight and heavily fought game that screams ""next goal wins"", but so far both teams contrived to miss their chances. The players are dead on the pitch, which isn't much of a surprise considering the grueling climate and travel they went through during the entire World Cup. Argentina are perfectly happy stopping play at every opportunity just to sneak into penalties, and I reckon Germany would've torn your arm out as well if you offered them that. 

And then it's somehow all turned on its head. The goal stems from slow, ponderous passing in midfield, moving the ball just for the sake of it, trying to regroup and find energy for one last attack, maybe. Kroos plays in Schürrle on the left, only Schürrle is just a few yards past the halfway line, with Götze right in his path down the wing. Schürrle turns, realizes he has a couple yards of space in a completely non-threatening area, and just figures he might as well try to drive a run straight at the defence and see what happens. 

Meanwhile, Götze peels off the wing towards the centre, into the space Schweinsteiger and Müller occupied just a moment earlier. Schürrle absolutely leaves Mascherano in the dust, and the covering Zabaleta is a tad late - allowing Schürrle to half-chip, half-cross the ball into the box, in the back of a horribly out of position Martin Demichelis, and right into Götze's path.

But all that is nothing without the finish. And my god what a finish it is - Götze jumps to take the ball on his chest about eight yards out and so far off to the left of the goal he's not even running into the six yard box, lands, takes a step to chase the ball, now only about three yards away from the line. The angle is tight, Romero's rushing towards him, and yet he twists his body into a strange, diving tackle like shape to volley it past the goalkeeper and into the side netting of the far corner with his weak foot.

The whole game was two teams neutralizing each other on the highest level, and missing the few golden opportunities they were given. But that single moment, with the game on knife's edge, is absolute magic - an absolutely incredible piece of skill right at the moment it was needed the most, on the biggest stage, in the dying moments of a tight game. 

It contains everything that Germany team encompassed that tournament: you've got the even-keeled, self-confident collective of players, who enabled each other to play to their strengths. It's all in that build-up, too: a limping, more dead than alive Schweinsteiger coordinating and rousing his teammates, Lahm skinning Palacio to the point he can only help himself with a tactical foul, the assured passing between Kroos and Schürrle, the decisive turn of pace Schürrle did so well so often, and the outstanding technical ability of Götze.  

Pelé's goal was nothing in comparison, a 3-1 in a resounding and never-in-doubt win. Even Zidane's penalty in 2006 was a much better goal than that - fight me.",sga1,,22,22,2020-04-11 10:33:21
fn2pnbr,t3_fz1b0a,"The first World Cup Final I remember watching was 2002. I loved that Brazil team, and definitely wanted them to win it - despite them knocking England out. They had so much flair, had these amazing yellow shirts with blue shorts, and I always like the team who beat my team to win the whole thing - as it justifies them knocking us out. Have little memory of the final itself, but I remember thinking Ronaldo was the best player ever.

My favourite World Cup Final is hard to say - think in modern times they tend to be a bit dour. Probably 2006, because of all the bare drama - and that's also my vote for the most controversial final I've ever seen. Though the stuff surrounding 1998 with Ronaldo's seizure gives it a lot of off-field controversy, at least. 

Least favourite is probably the Germany-Argentina final in 2014. Boring as hell - my only highlight was that it was a Chelsea player providing as assist for the winning goal.

In terms of biggest upset, the West Germany win over Hungary in 1954 is often purported to be so - as that Hungary team had dominated world football, and were massive favourites.

fn2vkfe,t3_fz1b0a,"**What is the first World Cup Final you remember watching?**

France v Italy, 2006. 1 moment in particular stands head above the rest for some reason...

**What has been your favourite World Cup Final, and why? What was your least favourite?**

Favourite was possibly still 2006, had a bit of everything didn't it? An almost missed Panenka, Buffon at his best, Zidane masterminding the middle of the park until he nuts Materazzi to retire in truly unbeatable fashion. 2014 was fairly exciting though.

Worst was 2010 for sure. It had moment but the World Cup final didn't need a battle but got one. From scything tackles, pathetic dives and an actual karate kick combined with stifling defence, it didn't excite enough across all 120 minutes of that nonsense.

**What was the most controversial incident of all time in a World Cup Final?**

Everyone will mention '66 and that's probably the right answer but I'm contrary so: 1954, was Puskas' equaliser *really* offside for the Miracle of Bern?

**What was the best goal of all time in a World Cup Final?**

Clearly Mandzukic in the 2018 final. Nothing Lloris could've done :D I've not seen enough clips of the really old cups to compare so wouldn't be fair to comment.

**What was the best individual performance of all time in a World Cup Final?**

Again, not really sure. I liked Casillas' performance in the 2010 final but ""best of all time"" has to be better than that. The thought of much good coming out of that final is also pretty hard to bear.

**What was the biggest upset of all time in a World Cup Final?**

Again, '54. Hungary were dominant, had annihilated the West Germans 8-3 in the group stages and had a terrifying group of players. Puskas and Kocsis are obviously the headline names but that was their one defeat across years of play.

**Have you ever attended a World Cup Final in person, and if so, what were your experiences and memories of the game?**

Never attended one in person, sadly.",ratkiller_75,,3,3,2020-04-11 11:36:09

2002 was my first WC final, and 2018 is probably my least favorite because of how one sided it was. Subasic was woefully out of form that match, don't think he had much saves in it.",thecescshow,,3,3,2020-04-11 11:42:55
fn5049e,t3_fz1b0a,"First final: FRG vs. ARG 1990. Blech. Wish it had been the 1986 edition instead of this crapfest. Extra disappointing bc I’m first-gen Italian and Italy looked like a lock to be in the final until Caniggia’s equalizer out of nowhere in the semi.

Favorite final: Probably 2018. There were some goals and a little bit of suspense, at least in the first half. 

Most controversial incident: Zidane is the obvious answer, but tbh he did what he did and got punished appropriately. Much worse was De Jong getting away with his karate kick in the 2010 final. 

Best goal of all time: Pains me to say it, but probably Goetze’s winner in 2014. I don’t know why that one doesn’t get more love. Really difficult volley to pull off, esp from that tight of an angle. 

Best individual performance: Idk, probably Pele in one of his finals, turning out-of-shape 1960s Czech / Swedish / whatever defenders fresh off their pre-game pack of smokes inside-out for 90 minutes. All the finals I saw (bar 2018) were too cagy to really have a dominant performance, so I assume you have to go back to the old days for something like that. 

Biggest upset: I’m told it’s FRG over HUN in 1954. Apparently Puskas and Kocsis were a wrecking crew and FRG were a bunch of retread jabronis who no one gave a chance to. Of course this was 20+ years before I was born, so I’ve only heard this second hand.

I remember being at a mate’s house in full England kit and red hair dye, flags on my cheeks. I almost cried watching Rooney getting sent off and seeing Ronaldo’s dirty wink. And then pure agony at watching us get knocked out on penalties. 

I watched the final on my own in my room (non-footballing family). I got all the way to extra-time before falling asleep. What does that mean? Well it means I fucking missed the Zidane head butt 😭

That Spain team was head and shoulders above the other teams and it especially showed in the Final where the Dutch had to result to dirty plays, which is more the referees fault for allowing it and failing to control the game than anything else.

That was the most tense I've ever been watching a football match, when Robben went through on goal for the second time I thought it was over, I thought there was no way he would miss a second 1on1 in the same game.

Every pass, every play, every player had to be perfect in order to successfully control the game. And when the ball dropped to Fabregas, and he played the ball through to Iniesta, well you know the rest.",JavBG17,,2,2,2020-04-11 11:40:17
fn2wynb,t3_fz1b0a,"sadly, the first World Cup Final I remember watching was '98. I was 6 so idk how much was clear at the time about Ronaldo's situation (I don't think it was clear) but I just remember the commentators talking about him constantly and how off he was. I remember how poorly he played and that's about it. Since I was so young I didn't learn what actually happened until years later too. Ronaldo was my favorite player since then but oddly enough I had a couple seizures when I was about 12 so kinda like made me relate to him even more.


But outside of that, I just wanted to share my all time favorite video. [The highlight package they played after the '06 Final.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHRcyPdo8nQ) Gets me emotional every single time. The U2 song and the highlights go together perfectly.

2010 I think was my favorite World Cup as a whole. Controversially, I liked the vuvuzelas. I just felt like that World Cup had *culture.* It was so unique to me; every other World Cup I feel you could watch them and all seem the same atmospherically but 2010 was unique in that sense",ronaldo119,,2,2,2020-04-11 11:59:16

It was very exciting watching Germany and Argentina scramble for a goal. Götze's goal was obviously the highlight for me.


Least favorite would then be 2018. Unfortunately I was traveling that day (of all the days to travel!) so I had to watch it on my laptop as I finished packing. I watched the end of the game on my phone in the bus station bathroom. Very anticlimactic and I didn't even get to enjoy watching the entire game. I think I prefer finals with close scores. On top of that, I didn't really enjoy the tournament itself as Nigeria crashed out thanks to Argentina (man am I tired of seeing them in the same group as us) and the US didn't even qualify.

fn3370i,t3_fz1b0a,"I almost misfired the question. I always misunderstand 'World Cup Final' and 'World Cup Finals'.

First off all, being an urdent football fan, I try to both watch and read about all the content I can on football. So, in my list, I'll include results of finals I watched live and those I either read about or at least whose highlights I watched.

| First WC final I watched.

- France vs Brazil 98'. I was a fan of Brazil strictly because of Ronaldo. So, you can guess how all that ended.

| Favourite final.

- In the ones I watched, I think I'll go for Brazil vs Germany 2002. Still an admirer of Brazil but this time, more of a Rivaldo fan than a Ronaldo one.

- In the ones I read about, I think as someone who read almost everything about Pele, I sometimes  have a soft spot for him and his story. Being injured in 66' at his prime because of being butchered by Bulgaria and North Korean defenders, he was denied a 3rd straight WC. As an excellent player, I think nature just gave him the 70' WC as the ideal sign out for a legend of the sport. 

So, yeah. Brazil 4-1 Italy, 1970.

| Least favourite finals.

- I didn't like Germany Vs Argentina 2014. Not hate it, but it wasn't a favourite. Close is France vs Croatia. I love goal galores but this looked like the most one-sided final I have seen in a while.

- In the ones I read about, I don't think I liked Uruguay Vs Brazil in 1950. Sounds absolutely gut-wrenching to lose a final on home soil. Especially in front of over 199k fans. Mostly home ones.
Oh and especially since I have a soft spot for Brazil.

| Most controversial final.

- Spain vs Netherlands 1-0. Because seriously that's too many cards for a final including a red card that many people forget. I however always say that Howard Webb made the right decision. An early red card would have ruined the game for us.

- I wanted to nominate Brazil vs France 98' for the Ronaldo incident but it was off the pitch. 

- In the ones I read about, I'm pretty sure one of those goals didn't cross the line and fans got onto the pitch somewhere too. Talking about 1966. 

| Best Goal.

- Not many great goals I've watched so I'll qualify Matterazzi's header vs France. Zidane's penalty is equally good but well, header wins vs spot for me. 

- In the ones I've read about, I think I'll go with Pele's 2nd(?) vs Sweden in 1958. The one where he bodies a defender, chests the ball, loops the next one and scores without the ball touching the ground. Quite a feat for a 17 year old in his 4th game of the biggest tournament in the world. 

| Individual performance. 

- I sincerely loved what Pogba did in 2018. He was felt. He looked up to it. However, I'll go for Zidane 1998. Not an imposing 'Maradona vs England' performance, but he got the job done. There is a good shout for what Ronaldo did in 2002 but I lowkey still think Rivaldo was better. Okay the goal scorer is always better but Rivaldo... Hard to explain this tho. 

So, Zidane. 

- The one's I read about. Geoff Hurst. No debate. You're home. You're winning your country's first world Cup. A hatrick. On home soil. Really. No one tops this. I had to discard Pele's exploits in 1958 because you just can't ignore Hurst's feat. 

| Upset. 

- Brazil 98' had no business losing to France given the football they exhibited prior to the final. Absolutely none. But home advantage, Zidane and that Ronaldo incident. So even when it's the highest margin scoreline of the ones I've watched, it's still an upset. 


- The ones I have read about. Hungary 2- Germany 3. Like WTF. You had one job Hungary. One job. Similar to Brazil, their route to the final deserved a world Cup. But trophies don't work like that. You win them after the final whistle of a final.",KSBrian007,,4,4,2020-04-11 13:27:36
fn2tk99,t3_fz1b0a,"In all honesty, I didn't think 1990 even had a final. I remember Pearce stepping up for a penalty and then it got cancelled as he was running up to it right? A shame, because I'm so sure we would've won the shootout!


Anyway I remember bits of the 1994 final. With it being in USA so the awkward timezone and it going the distance, it was much too late for a little boy like me to handle. Also, with England not participating in it at all, didn't really have much interest.


Favourite final has to be 1998 though. The will he won't he nature of Ronaldo was some of the most barmiest pre match hype I was ever part of and then Zizou downing Brazil, was such an unprecedented moment.


Rest of them since then have been duds imo, little 1-0 victories in the 110th minute or so just as I brace for a shootout...boo. Then 2018 comes along and it's just a case of why couldn't we put that first half to bed just a few days before it...

During 1st goal his and Jesus’ only job at that corner is to clear the ball and they fail at it, although id blame Jesus more in this case

During 2nd goal Fernandinho must foul Lukaku when he controls the ball or at least behave more aggressively. Yet he lets him control the ball and then stands and watches Paulinho trying to make up 30m and catch up to Lukaku

Another poor player was Coutinho - imo 2nd worst Brazillian today. Yes, he made a great assist, but he also missed a great chance, Lost ball countless times in final third and he was trying really hard to score from outside the box when 3 Belgians were blocking him without 2nd thought

I also feel that ref was really poor and hope not to see him during this WC again. 

Not only he missed penalty/penalties, but also made quite a few medium sized or small mistakes, which could have been impactful - he seemed to forget about cards when he played advantage(Coutinho,Lukaku at least), just straight up didnt give cards for plays which should have been carded(Neymar, Fellaini!!, Fagner), added not enough time.
My favourite decision of his was when Witsel who was holding Fernandinho who was behind him fell and while falling slapped Brazilian in the face and ref gave free kick for Belgium",,,22,22,2018-07-07 16:32:32

They key difference imo was that Belgium showed up improved by adjusting their tactics.

Brazil on the other hand didn't do that. Firminho was heavily outperforming G.Jesus yet he didn't get the starting spot. 

Regarding the higher potential I said earlier, Neymar and especially Coutinho were very underwhelming last night. Even players like Marcelo-Fernandinho-Paulinho, they've proven they usually perform better than that.

e1yfzmy,t3_8wu97n,"Copy pasting my comment from the daily discussion thread

I rewatched some parts of the Brazil-Belgium match yesterday and have come to the conclusion that Martinez outmanaged Tite yesterday. The first thing was Belgium's interesting shape. When Brazil were attacking, Chadli tucked in next to Witsel and marked the space Paulinho usually excels in, which made their defensive shape look something like a 4-4-2 diamond or a Christmas tree depending on where the front three positioned themselves. In attack Chadli always made runs to the wing and Vertonghen dropped back to create a lopsided shape where Chadli's positioning was almost on the same line as Meunier on the right. This created shape that looks sort of like a 3-2-4-1, with the 4 all being fairly wide which allowed Fellaini to have good late runs into the box which overwhelmed the already overwhelmed Fernandinho. Another well executed move by Belgium was doubling up on the wings with both Hazard and Chadli on the left and De Bruyne and Meunier on the right. This worked especially well on Marcelo who didn't receive nearly any support from Neymar, unlike Fagner who received plenty of support by Willian.

The biggest issue in the Brazilian midfield and defence was the space left by Marcelo's forward runs, which is usually covered by Casemiro's clever runs, but yesterday Brazil's defence struggled with both De Bruyne and Meunier dominating him which forced especially Miranda wide very often. Around the 60th minute Belgium's front three started to tire and therefore the only tactic was to just hold on to dear life. With that being said, Brazil should have scored more than once in the second half. A special shout out to Fellaini and Meunier who were absolutely incredible and completely stifled Brazil's amazing Marcelo-Coutinho-Neymar triangle.",FlyingArab,,13,13,2018-07-07 16:30:48

That being said, Belgium were for the most part fantastic. Roberto Martinez got his tactics spot on and addressed the areas of weakness. Against Japan, Carrasco and Mertens were the weak links and very ineffective. So what does he do? Make changes in the right areas; with Chadli and Fellaini coming in who deserved to start and repaid their manager's decision in jest. Another thing to add were the standout performances. Courtois had the game of his life, and could have saved the Titanic from sinking last night, Lukaku shrugged off his ""flat track bully"" moniker and performed very impressively, and De Bruyne as imperious as ever; dictating the match with another world-class performance from midfield.

**Some highlights from the legal filing**

It starts off with

>Niemann is a 19-year-old, self-taught chess prodigy. He brings this action to recover from the devastating damages that Defendants have inflicted upon his reputation, career, and life by egregiously defaming him and unlawfully colluding to blacklist him from the profession to which he has dedicated his life.

So you know it's gonna be good.

>Making matters worse for Carlsen, Niemann embarrassed Carlsen by playfully taunting him during his post-match interview. Notorious for his inability to cope with defeat, Carlsen snapped. Enraged that the young Niemann, fully 12 years his junior, dared to disrespect the “King of Chess,” and fearful that the young prodigy would further blemish his multi-million dollar brand by beating him again, Carlsen viciously and maliciously retaliated against Niemann by falsely accusing Niemann, without any evidence, of somehow cheating during their in-person game and demanding that the organizers of the Sinquefield Cup immediately disqualify Niemann from the tournament.

Carlsen is very specifically known for being calm and mature when losing, so I'm not sure where this ""notorious inability"" comes from.

>Unbiased top chess analysts have dissected Niemann and Carlsen’s Sinquefield Cup game in excruciating detail and concluded that Niemann’s victory resulted more from Carlsen’s particularly poor play than Niemann’s particularly exceptional play.

This is absolutely amazing. I'm just basking in it.

>Despite the falsity of Defendants’ accusations, Defendants’ malicious defamation and unlawful collusion has, by design, destroyed Niemann’s remarkable career in its prime and ruined his life  
>  
>Nakamura has also had an acrimonious relationship with Niemann for several years, dating back to when they both worked as streamers for Chess.com and Nakamura viewed Niemann as a threat to his dominance on chess streaming platforms.

Hans, with all kindness, you were never even close to being a threat. You have 61,000 Twitch followers, he has 1.7 million. I'm not even a fan of Hikaru and I know that this is ridiculous.

>By all accounts, Niemann was a massive underdog, particularly given that Carlsen was playing with the white pieces, which afforded Carlsen the distinct competitive advantage of making the first move in the game. Yet, unlike the vast majority of Carlsen’s opponents, Niemann was not intimidated by Carlsen’s stature and did not play for a draw like most would have done. Niemann played to win. He attacked Carlsen early and flipped the advantage to the black pieces, which rattled Carlsen for the remainder of the game. Unnerved by Niemann’s unexpected confidence and early strategic advantage, Carlsen made numerous mistakes upon which Niemann capitalized to secure a tremendous victory over Carlsen, which, by all accounts, should have propelled Niemann’s career to the next level and allowed him to continue realizing his enormous potential as the next great American chess player. Unbeknownst to Niemann at the time, Defendants would do whatever it took ensure that this would never happen.

This reads like someone making their first anime OC for a chess show, and making him the single most overpowered and edgy player ever, while everyone conspires against him, especially his bitter rival (who fans will 100% ship with him). But he will not be overcome by them, because by the ~~heart of the cards~~ beads of the board, he can beat anyone.

Honestly, I'd watch that show.

>As a result of this shocking defeat, Carlsen snapped. Unable to accept the reality of his unexpected loss, Carlsen reflexively retaliated by defaming Niemann to Michael Khodarkovsky, the Executive Director of the Grand Chess Tour, falsely accusing Niemann of cheating during their game and demanding that Niemann be immediately disqualified ... Because Carlsen had absolutely no evidence of Niemann’s cheating, Khodarkovsky refused to comply with Carlsen’s dictatorial command

""Your honor, my client was so fucking awesome at chess that he drove his opponent to madness""

It should go without saying that Khodarkovsky has confirmed that Magnus made no such request.

>After Carlsen succeeded in laying the groundwork against Niemann with his initial defamatory accusations of cheating, he unleashed the full force of his newly-broadened media empire to publicly bolster those allegations and drown out any legitimate sources of opposition that demonstrated why Carlsen’s allegations were untrue

What media empire? The man owns a chess app and has a Twitter account.

>To bolster this unprecedented joint ban, which effectively blacklisted Niemann from professional chess, Nakamura leveraged his platform as Chess.com’s top streamer and credibility as a top chess player to engage in an all-out blitz of defamatory accusations

Well, this is just ridiculous. As we all know, an all out chess blitz can last a *maximum* of ten minutes (as per FIDE regulations), and Hikaru streamed for far longer than that. Honestly, how can a supposed professional know so little about blitz chess?

j7j4hmq,t3_10tin5t,"Great writeup! I'd like to read two more pieces of evidence into the record, if I may.

First, a lot of people speculated that Hans' rating would fall off a cliff after this accusation. The reasoning being that if he was unfairly gaining an edge by cheating, and then was suddenly placed under increased scrutiny that would stop him from continuing to cheat, then his performances would revert back to whatever his true playing strength was.

That hasn't happened. He's had some up and downs, like any player, but in the last few months his average performance rating is pretty much exactly in line with the 2700-rated, top-40-in-the-world level that he was at before the accusation.

Second, in Magnus' most recent tournament, he got off to an uncharacteristically rocky start by his standards. This included his first two-game losing streak since 2015, the second game of which he lost, with the white pieces, to Nodirbek Abdusattorov, another prodigy even younger than Hans with almost exactly the same rating.

Magnus then rebounded and finished in a strong second place. But the picture this paints is of a player who is extremely strong, and still comfortably the best in the world, but who isn't unbeatable to nearly the same degree that he was a few years ago. And the idea that a 2700-rated teenager might just happen to play better than that guy on a given day is actually not that hard to believe.",Quintaton_16,,36,36,2023-02-07 03:56:05

As someone who was only aware of Magnus as ""that young prodigy"", the narrative after everyone muddied the water, feels picture perfect like what we're taught fictional media (and other e-sport) as the way an entitled top player would response in anger when he lost to a less-favored opponent. It's really a complicated drama with a lot of underlying tension in it, but it's lost in translation because it took so long for everyone to be direct about it.

I think chess as a sport hadn't realized that over-night they became an e-sport and should probably conduct more like an established e-sport does. Particularly with PR, because it's really not a good look when the story takes a life on its own until it gets boiled down to ""top chess player lost to a trash player -- gets angry and accuses him of cheating using buttplug."" Which is wrong, but it really should have never gotten to that point.",FengLengshun,,13,13,2023-02-05 13:54:00
j775j2z,t3_10tin5t,"Really good write up and you hit all the twists and turns as the saga dragged on in real life.

(Apologies if I'm restating things you wrote, I read thru over multiple sittings)

One possible avenue of cheating I saw speculated was via a (potentially purposeful) leak in Magnus's camp. Magnus let's it be known within in camp or just to the suspected leaker(s) that he's going with an unusual opening. When Hans is magically prepped for it, that's a sign he is cheating. It's a little cloak and dagger-y and doesn't jive with the sense given by Hikaru that Magnus has long suspected Hans, but would explain the confidence and steadfastness that Magnus has in the allegation of Hans as a cheater.

One other thing to note (this is what I think OP could have already covered), is that cheating at this level doesn't have to be play Rook to A5. It could be as simple as the computer engine sees this as a pivotal turning point in the match, so I'm signalling you to tell you to look harder for a premium move and this juncture.",OhTheGrandeur,,66,66,2023-02-04 16:25:19

>Hikaru became a *very* significant figure in all this. He had never hesitated to criticize Hans before, and he made his thoughts very clear

He has also said that Hans has been a suspected cheater for a long time and that another competitor (I think Nepo?) has raised questions to the tournament organisers regarding his validity. Plus there are 2 year old stream clips about multiple high-level players being suspicious of him.

Like no one was thinking Hans is actually a better player or about to steal Magnus’ title. But the ‘it’s him or me’ basically torpedoed this guy’s career, and at that point it wasn’t a sure thing that he had cheated. 

Idk, taking this kind of approach means that if Hans had been innocent his reputation would never have recovered anyway. Meanwhile Magnus can’t lose because he’s the best player, so even if he was wrong people would brush it off and forget about it. And Magnus can just pull these stunts again if he doesn’t like another player because it clearly works to get them banned from the chess world even before there’s proof.",pastelkawaiibunny,,10,10,2023-02-07 15:29:06

j7706nc,t3_10tin5t,">(especially since Magnus played white, a major advantage)

This is what's crazy to me about chess. Generally, when you've got some incredibly high level of skill involved in a game like this, where people obsess over it for their entire lives and have careers centered around the game, you can be pretty sure that the game is completely 100% fair for both players. I mean, to pick a similar example in video games, look at Super Smash Bros Melee, a game with nowhere near the history or longevity or in-depth obsessiveness of chess, and all the changes they've made to the way it's played at a competitive level over the last twenty years in order to make sure it is *absolutely perfectly balanced*. Removing items. Limiting the stages to only a tiny fraction of those available. Placing limits on the number of times you're allowed to grab the edge of the stage. And those limitations only continue to get stricter over time to make sure nobody ever has an unfair advantage, no matter how slight.

But chess--the absolute granddaddy of all competitive board games--isn't balanced. This has been known since the 1800s, and all the statistics support it: white will win more often than not. And it's not like this is only a thing at low-level play, either. It actually becomes *more* of an issue when the players are at a higher level, and even more so when computers play against each other. It's genuinely bizarre to me that chess, of all things, is so noticeably unfair for one player.",IHad360K_KarmaDammit,,80,80,2023-02-04 15:48:37

j779ij7,t3_10tin5t,"As someone who reads legal complaints all day to decide on MSJ, MJP, preliminary objections, and other legal nonsense, the Complaint really isn't that remarkable. If anything, the paragraphs should have been broken down further, but I don't work in Missouri, so it's possible that the standard form is just different in Missouri and wherever his attorneys are from (assuming somewhere in the northeast since Niemann is from Connecticut? Massachusetts? Somewhere around there).

What's more telling about the lawsuit is that it hasn't yet been dismissed. It was filed on October 20; preliminary objections or an answer would have needed to be filed by mid-November. Let's assume that POs were filed rather than an answer. A complaint can be thrown out on preliminary objections for a few reasons, the plaintiff can be ordered to amend the complaint, or the objections are denied and the defendants are ordered to answer. Clearly the complaint wasn't thrown out. 

If it was ordered to be amended, that means the amended complaint would have been due a few weeks ago (motion filed mid November, answer due early to mid December (again, unfamiliar with MO's rules, but my jurisdiction is 20 days to respond, so I'm assuming they're somewhere around 20-30, since that's pretty standard in the US), then amended complain due late December to early January (20-30 days again). Then the process repeats. 

If the POs were denied, then the defendants would be ordered to answer the complaint within 20-30 days, so early/mid December. We *have* to assume given public knowledge so far that there will be affirmative defenses/new matter raised in the answer. Niemann's response would be due 20-30 days later, effectively closing the pleadings stage. (If they filed an answer instead of preliminary objections (unlikely but possible), move all the dates forward about a month and a half.) At that point, the defendants' attorneys would be remiss to not file a motion for judgment on the pleadings, if the case is so slam dunk (without seeing exhibits attached to an answer, I'm not buying that it's slam dunk enough for MJP). Eventually, summary judgment motions will be filed, but those will come further down the line after discovery, including depositions like from Ken Regan. It may get tossed on MSJ based on further evidence, like what Regan has to say on the matter, but that's pretty far down the line.

Basically what I'm saying is that the lawsuit is not as much nonsense as you think it is. Is Niemann likely to win? Idk, probably not, but juries can be weird. I've seen cases where it's a slam dunk for one side or the other, and the jury just decides they don't like a lawyer, so they decide for the other side. The fact that Carlson was, as you put it, ""playing middle school games"" over the accusations may not sit right with the jury, especially because it was obvious what he was saying. Niemann's attitude may not sit right with them. The other thing to keep in mind is that it depends on whether the reports of cheating online will even be admissible as evidence, since it's definitely going to be a motion in limine if the case makes it to trial. It's not habit evidence, which is admissible under the federal rules of evidence, as it hasn't occurred frequently enough. It's prior bad acts, which typically aren't admissible evidence when they aren't analogous. Cheating online and cheating OTB are two very different things, and even the report acknowledged that. Only time will tell, but the lawsuit is going to be interesting regardless.",kcvngs76131,,30,30,2023-02-04 16:51:42

This is my takeaway as well, there was definitely enough speculation about Hans' suspicious playstyle that Magnus must've been thinking about this whilst playing. Magnus also has been brewing on cheating in chess for a while and after making some judgement errors OTB decided this was the time to save his own ass by accusing Hans.

Magnus definitely has a point about needing more countermeasures but tanked his reputation to prove a point.

Hans cheating online is a problem, but that was like the least of the issue here - everything regarding his tournaments spawned 95% of Magnus picking a fight and making a big stink of everything.

I believe Hans cheated - I also think Magnus was a giant fucking crybaby over it, and he's personally responsible for a lot of the shit that got slung at him.

And I think the whole Chess.com banning him thing ""oh we swear it's not in retribution"" is pretty colossal horseshit, since they conducted the investigation in response. If they had this info from years ago, then they would have banned him then. The fact that they didn't meant they either sat on it and sprung it now as retribution, or they did the investigation as retribution.

j7ajc4z,t3_10tin5t,"I think Hans is an ass, butt:

* The most damning thing was his interview right after the game, but he is known to be someone who doesn't like interviews, doesn't put any effort in them at all and is sarcastic as hell. So trusting anything he says or drawing conclusions from it I think was a mistake that a lot of people made.

* The chesscom report said more about chesscom than Hans. First off, why did they publish it? In it, they reveal that they coerce people into confessing cheating in order to unlock their account. They also included emails and phone call transcripts which were assured at the time to be confidential. Just really scummy stuff, and for what? All they needed to do was to leave it at ""We're certain he cheated online a lot more than he says he did and that's why he was banned before."" But to betray confidentiality and just decide to ban him again seemed really immature.

* I think most ppl would agree sport is much better off that this happened. Cheating prevention is taken more seriously now. That the guy to take the fall is an egotistical jerk I suppose is not the worst outcome.

\- Medvedev does to Zverev at 2022 USO what Zverev did to Novak to 2021 USO IRL(tires him out completely before final)

\- Medvedev if anything is even worse on clay in this timeline because winning this many Slams and getting multiple year end #1s on basically HC only makes him not even worry about his issues on the surface at all(he does get moderately/somewhat significantly better on grass over time as he did IRL) so we won't be seeing any career Slams lol

When they qualified it put a big, dumb smile on my face because I always remember them having good participations. In 2010 obviously... Things happened, and I totally understand why they might not like us, or at the very least why they surely despise Luis Suárez. A part of me wants to say that he'll start as a sort of decoy and as a mental tactic, but his knees are far too gone and he'll probably be rested and Darwin will be upfront with Cavani or alone. I do hope he gets to see the pitch that game, though. If we were in a World Cup with real atmosphere, I'd say something to the effect of 'I can't wait to hear the two fan sections chanting at each other, the whistles for Suárez"" so on and so forth. However, this World Cup is not gonna have the same party atmosphere, sadly. Still, I'm expecting a great match, a wonderful group stage, and hopefully Ghana can gel and make a push for the R16 (although preferably against Korea and Portugal pls)

It’s just like the same argument that was made around Infinite, just in comics form. “When you think about it, these characters are just functions, so X-Men and Mutants don’t need to be here for you to enjoy things, right!”

Except, no. Especially with characters as beloved and iconic to the entire Marvel universe as the X-Men, unless you had some absolutely brilliant story telling this was going to fall flat on its face. And as some of the comics output at the time shows, we ain’t talkin all time classic stories in this era. 

And then it’s an exercise rendered moot a few years later once the Fox acquisition happened, and Mutants were once again free to be pushed.

At least Ms. Marvel was good and Kamala managed to become a breakout hit. I just hope they don't do a reverse and turn her into a mutant in the comics like they did in the MCU.

The problem was that, IIRC, Marvel editorial *didn't know* what the Bad Thing in question was.

ij3arot,t3_wgvgob,"This is, both ironically and unironically, my favorite non-X-Men era of comics. It's so bad it's good(as long as you don't actually read any of the comics). Highlights include:

- Medusa pretending like she didn't already know the terrigen cloud killed mutants, even though it almost killed Quicksilver

- it never being mentioned that at one point terrigen killed humans too? Like with the mutants the retcon is that because of atmosphere mixing the cloud now kills mutants, but no mention of it changing to no longer kill mutants? My head canon? Black bolt didn't know it was gonna change it's effect on humans and was ok with killing us all to get some inhumans.

- Moon Girl trusting Medusa to do the right thing, even though there shouldn't be any debate. And if Medusa had said no, Moon Girl would have become an accomplice to genocide

- Inferno. They tried to make an audience stand in with fire powers. Do you know how many marvel characters control fire? A lot. Like a lot a lot. Inferno is the most boring protag I have ever seen.

- Iso. God I wish she was a mutant. Her design, her powers, even her backstory are more interesting than the inhumans deserve.

- reader. If this man explains how his powers work ONE MORE TIME-

- Synapse from Uncanny Avengers was actually pretty fun. Even if UA low-key made it seem like captain America was ok with genocide(I guess he was hydra cap at the time so he actually was?). Sidenote: Rogue is still the best part of that series, especially the scenes with her doing telepathic defense

- Fucking Medusa sleeping with Human Torch (there's a whole other Perlmutter arc with the FF). And then she dumps him for black bolt as soon as she can???

- speaking of, their relationship isn't terrible, but putting it front and center was a bad idea. They're low-key terrible to each other. Also the scene in IvX when everyone looks up at them and goes: ""Medusa... And Black Bolt... Together. That's beautiful."" Worst writing I have ever seen. Absolutely cringe.

ij2adgu,t3_wgvgob,"Thank you, that was a great read.

Marvel was really cutting their nose to spite their face. They messed with and sidelined one of their consistently best-selling lines because they were angry about having sold the movie rights. I doubt Fox would ever have tried to adapt new material; they were busy doing the Dark Phoenix Saga over and over again.

The Inhumans TV show was such a trainwreck (though I liked Anson Mount). 

I think the X-Men have been toying with setting up their mutant island for quite a few years but it never took before Hickman. Obviously, Magneto had Avalon and Asteroid M decades ago, but as early as after the destruction of Genosha I got the impression that they were trying to do something with a mutant nation. Didn't the actual X-Men also briefly live on Asteroid M/Utopia in the 2010s? Or was that the same thing as Cyclops in Alaska you mentioned?

I'm really late to Hickman's X-Men and don't think it's perfect, but I enjoy that after 50 years, they're trying to do something different with the X-Men, and I think it's an amazing sandbox for creative exploration.",ailathan,,51,51,2022-08-05 15:15:42
ij36ah9,t3_wgvgob,"The would add two things:

Inhumans predate the X-Men. Kirby took what he learned with the Inhumans when creating the X-men. As Stan Lee has said over the years, it was easier to explain why someone had super powers if they were simply born with them. The Inhumans template provided that solution. Making them mutants instead of Inhumans freed them from the continuity baggage of all Inhumans being subjects of the Inhuman kingdom. 

""Secret societies of super individuals were pretty much dime-a-dozen at Marvel"" is no joke. Kirby would do it again and again. The [New Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Evolutionary) were a secret group of Animal People created by the High Evolutionary who learned genetic manipulation form an Inhuman. The Eternals were cosmic Inhumans and their Deviants counter parts were cosmic Mutants. And The formula would be used by other Marvel creators for other groups but the connection is the most obvious between Kirby's Inhumans and X-Men.

Bonus:  
Kirby would take those ideas and do them again over at DC. The New Men became the Animal People in Kamandi and the Eternals were refined into the New Gods. Obviously they are not a 1 to 1 comparison but after how Kirby went from the Inhuman to the X-men you can begin to see how he iterated and improved ideas.",ToasterManDan,,41,41,2022-08-05 18:39:56
ij3evyj,t3_wgvgob,"> It was a baffling event, as both the Inhumans (the guys doing ethnic cleansing) and the X-Men (victims of ethnic cleansing but they’re mean about it) were both treated as having valid arguments. 

To my recollection, it was worse than that because the X-Men said ""I assume the only way to solve this problem is to kill every single Inhuman, and will make absolutely no effort to verify that""

while the Inhumans said ""I assume this development is perfect and good and causes no problems to anyone at all, and will make no effort to verify that, and that the mutants, many of whom I've known and called friend for years, are trying to kill us for absolutely no reason at all""

then every time they met up they just started attacking each other. It was the perfect example of ""A five minute conversation could have avoided all of this"" and relied, as most of these VS. books do, on 
 everyone acting completely out of character to make the conflict work.

And how did it end? Finally someone had that five minute conversation. One of the x-men said ""But the mists are killing mutants!"" and the Inhumans said ""Oh snap, really? Well let's work together to get rid of it"" and that was the end.",sonofaresiii,,43,43,2022-08-05 19:35:13

1. The FF series was declining anyway. Sales numbers have been steadily dropping for decades.  The movies being pretty bad probably didn’t help. 

2. They were never as popular as the X-Men. Wolverine alone was more popular. Hell, even Cyclops, Professor X, or Magneto probably have more brand recognition.

Also says a lot that Marvel's idea to really make this stick was to have the Inhumans be complicit in a genocide of the Mutants (Y'know, that thing that half the X-Men *villains* have been trying to do since the X-Men were created), and then try to portray Cyclops as ""worse than Hitler"" for attempting to *stop the genocide of his people.*",ToaArcan,,29,29,2022-08-05 19:31:20

I’m probably one of the two people in existence who liked the Inhumans push, and in an ironic twist of fate I’ve grown to resent the X-Men for stealing their shtick and somehow being infinitely more problematic about it (because unlike Inhuman society, we were just supposed to accept all the awful, morally heinous things Krakoa had been doing as right and good and deserved).",DuelaDent52,,9,9,2022-08-05 21:12:37

That's basically Asgard, Guardians, Kree, etc etc. A secretive, isolated world with a lot of lore that we only ever see hints of in the main storylines but who have their own shit going on so they don't care about us and we have limited reason to care about them? Basically Atlantis.

I liked how Agents of SHIELD did it, and not gonna lie, I definitely got the impression that they basically just used the Inhumans as a way to have ""people randomly start sprouting superpowers"" without infringing on X-Men copyright and background. A lot of the story in Agents of SHIELD really tied into X-Men and non-Inhuman Marvel stuff (i.e. government registering Inhumans/superhumans only for someone to use that as a hit list, bigotry against super-powered people, etc.) And their version of terrigenesis (the terrigenic substance/Applied Phlebotinum being likened to irl oceanic plastics pollution to proliferate slowly through the (sea)food chain, not just that random fucking cloud) made *so* much more sense.",Nyxelestia,,8,8,2022-08-05 23:41:51

I'd have Kulcha playing together for most games. I believe they perform better when they're playing together. Might give Jadeja a go in the last few games just to see how he goes.

>Should Dhoni bat at 4?

If we lose two wickets inside 10 overs, then I'd trust Dhoni to be the firefighter and pull the team towards recovery more than any other player. A case can be made for Shankar as well, since he's great at rotating the strike and is comfortable against both spinners and pacers. He can be a very effective batsman in the middle overs.

>Choosing one from KL Rahul/Vijay Shankar/Dinesh Karthik

I don't think Rahul should play in the middle order. He gets bogged down a lot in the absence of fielding restrictions and fails to rotate the strike. He can definitely be played as an opener in a couple of games. 

Now it's a toss up between Karthik and Shankar, and honestly I'm content with either of them. Karthik brings in experience and he found some form in later stage of the IPL but, I don't think his game suits the number 4 position. He's good at playing quick cameos in the last 10-15 overs so if he plays, I'd have Dhoni at 4 and Karthik at 5 or even 6.",,,13,13,2019-05-13 14:01:35
enbvr0j,t3_bo33a3,"1. Kulcha have been our biggest strength in the last couple of years, and I wouldn't break them up for whatever little Jadeja provides with the bat.
Bhuvi offers just about the same with the bat if not more, so only play Jadeja in case India want to play Shami and Bumrah.

2. I can't believe people still believe that KL Rahul can 
play in the middle order, he should only get a place in the 11, incase of an injury to either one of Dhawan/Rohit.
So I believe India's starting number 4 is going to be VJ Shankar, in case he shits the bed, India can put Karthik at 4, incase that doesn't work out either, you put Dhoni the crisis man at 4 with Karthik at 6. Karthik has done very well as the finisher.
So that's what I'd do with the middle order in that exact order if nothing works out.

3. I think it's very important that India goes into the WC with a clear plan to utilise Hardik. He can be the difference between 320-odd totals and 370 totals. He's come of age at the right time as well, and has proved he's not just a 26(12)* kind of player anymore.

enbpst3,t3_bo33a3,"> Choosing two out of Ravindra Jadeja/Kuldeep Yadav/Yuzuvendra Chahal.

My XI would be the same as yours to start with. Jadeja should not start, the extra batsman does not seem to be required in a team where Bhuvi plays too (and can perform approximately whatever role Jadeja can with the bat). DK comes in if Shankar proves to be a dud, but DK comes in at 6 or 7 with everyone moving a step ahead.

I hope we do not experiment with the top 3 if there's a tough start. I know Shastri said something a couple months ago, but I hope that's that. We could have experimented in the past but now is not the time.

> Should Dhoni bat at 4?

Not at the start, not unless we absolutely need him to do that because both DK and Shankar fail. Dhoni is a nervy starter and Kohli needs someone who is more confident with him, take singles, etc. If there's a collapse, sure.

I **really** wish we took Pant because with him and Pandya in the team, we had the luxury of sending one of them up the order to take on spin if needed. Pandya will likely be under-utilised because if we punt him at the top of the order and he goes out early, we don't have enough firepower at the end.

> Choosing one from KL Rahul/Vijay Shankar/Dinesh Karthik.

Shankar to start with since they have backed him. DK after him if Shankar isn't able to do much. Rahul last because he hasn't really played too much in the middle order.

Overall, I think our team is pretty well balanced. We have absolutely botched our #4 search though, so now a lot depends on how smartly we utilise our middle order. Each of them has a strength but none of them is a really reliable all-situation player either, so we need to manage that well. Our bowling is top notch, so I'd hope we stop other teams at 320-330 and chase that down.",aazzbb,,16,16,2019-05-13 13:06:01

I don't get this criticism. Our middle-order by no means is as bad as we make it out to be. How many teams can boast of a player averaging 43+ with 103 SR? And if Dhoni can carry over his IPL form, he'd be as good a finisher as any, except Buttler. And how many seam-bowling all-rounders are there who can strike at 117? Pandya is not *that* far behind Stokes overall. If you put it all into context, this middle order definitely isn't that bad.

enfo9c8,t3_bo33a3,"In the initial few games kulcha will play. India would try and not use them to often as other teams will get used to it. Surely they will play against SA and perhaps Aus too. Kedar (if fit - anybody knows his condition) and Hardik are key to this line up. 

Tho Shami is in good form i think initially bhuvi and Bhumrah will play. 

I have a feeling that KL would be played more than we think and wont be warming the bench so much. If kedar is injured then he comes in Vijay moves to 5.

Having said i am still on the fence with Pant and Karthik though Karthik is already in the team.   
If indian team handle the crunch situation they are quite formidable as they can play both kind of games likes attacking or defensive if needed. Eng at the moment is only playing 1 dimension and we saw what happened with their bowling that day. 

This world cup a good bowling side will win the WC and for that reason i feel Aus given recent form and India have good chance. England too due to their batting but we will see. :)",Nam3less79,,1,1,2019-05-14 07:33:53

&#x200B;

This WC being so long that I am sure team will evolve based on opposition and ground. Plus the fast bowlers will be rotated to keep them fresh for knock outs. 

&#x200B;

I am sure few players will be left out if they don’t do well. I am putting a question on Dhawan and Kuldeep(had awful IPL). There could be grounds where india might play 3 fast bowlers.",shawman123,,1,1,2019-05-14 20:31:37
eo3shrh,t3_bo33a3,"Considering the rumors about kedar out cox of injury. Feel bad for the kedar jadhav, but he has been injury prone lately. Missed entire season of IPL after first season. 

I think this helps KL secure a place at #4 as long as he delivers there. If kedar was present MS may bat at 4, Kedar at 5 or 6. But that flexibility is gone. I don't think that is bad. Top Heavy batters will know their responsibilities to bat long. Any one of top 4 plays 35 - 40 overs, it could help with the batting.
​
But bowling wise, they would not have the luxury of 6th batsman, unless at risk of weakening the batting depth.
​
​
My playing combinations for critical games :
1-2 : Brohit, Dhavan,
3 : Kohli
4 : KL
5 : MSD
6 : Pant/DK
7 : Hardik
8 : Kuldeep
9 : Shami/Bhuvi
10 : Chahal
11 : Bumrah
​
V. Shanker floating replacement for #4, 6 or 7
Jaddu replacement for Chahal.


At this point, the generic squad has two spots that are not solid. #4 and #6. This is a  great opportunity to seal it.",poorminion,,1,1,2019-05-19 09:03:49
enc0c23,t3_bo33a3,"Nice post OP. Congrats.

I think you have picked a good XI, but to me it seems like it's missing a specialist batsman. I would pick KL at #4 and tell him that he will get the entire WC at #4 .
Also I would pick jaddu against teams which have crazy good fast bowling ( Aus in particular) ahead of Kuldeep to bolster the batting.

Ideally this would be my team


Dhawan

Rohit

Kohli

KL

Dhenier

Shankar

Pandya

Jadeja

Chahal

Shami

Bumrah




DK ain't making my side unless dhenier gets severely injured. DK can't play at 4 or 6 because he can't seem to build an innings(can only slog) . If both DK and dhenier are picked in the same XI, DK should come in at #7 or #8",VoyagerPaleBlueDot,,2,2,2019-05-13 14:42:22
enbz3tm,t3_bo33a3,"I think we need to give a try to kl rahul at no.4

That man is an exceptional talent, he has been Indias best batsman in ipl for two consecutive seasons, scoring almost 600 in both. He has anchored this season, completed atleast three chases, and even gone berserk at the start, and berserk at the end! He has scored ipl century too in both seasons, and to top it off, he has an intl t20 century at no.4! 

We need to give him a try and stick to him for some games. We have played a liability no.4 since ct2017, and have won on the bulk of our top 3, sometimes dhoni and our bowling

As a fielder, kl rahul> shankar

As a batsman, kl rahul>>> shankar

As a bowler, shankar=kl rahul, because literaly both havent bowled a single ball in ipl. 

Shankar only made sense when we didnt have pandya in playing XI. Now we have him in amazing finishing form, and a good option for fourth, who can sync with jadhavs bowling

We want a proper batsman at no.4 who can defend, anchor and finish at the end. No better candidate that kl rahul. If he comes good, he can single handedly win us matches

Shankar should be a replacement for jadhav, incase of his injury, because they are similar kind of players",turtlemons,,1,1,2019-05-13 14:31:54

eneasoa,t3_bo33a3,"From an outside perspective I think India are too reliant on a few big name players in each role and they lack a certain depth following on from these guys. One injury to a top player could mean absolute disaster for them whereas it'd be only a major hit for other teams. The batting outside of Kohli is massively inconsistent, Rohit is enormous but inconsistent, that's not what you want in semi/finals. Bumrah is unbelievable but beyond that I don't think the English grounds will offer to much to Bhuvi and the spinners.

I think India may be a fraction over-hyped for this tournament, they'll be very tested against stronger bowling lineups that have a plan for Kohli, and considering the slow decline of Kuldeep's effectiveness, they could be looking at 300+ scores consistently, that is if Bumrah doesn't run through the opposition first. 

In saying all of this, if someone else stands up and has a big tournament, I think they stand a good chance. If two or three players can go with Kohli and Bumrah, then they win honestly.",cuttlefish10,,0,0,2019-05-14 01:18:54

Sadly, I wasn’t shocked at all about the costumes, poor judgment and worse reaction to criticism. I can offer some context but please don’t mistake it for excuses. Russia, despite being home to dozens if not hundreds of ethnic groups, remains at its general foundations rather homogenous, where people of color in particular (thinking here of my Angolan friends who studied at Lumumba uni) were “othered” and treated as exotic demon aliens at best and inferior subhumans at worst. 

Unfortunately, even if things may have improved in major cities with advent of travel and internet, a lot of the ignorant attitudes remain, particularly in older generation. There is also just plain ignorance and indifference at play too, as with the pseudo(?) Native American hand over mouth gesture (I remember it used a but when I was a kid in somewhat mocking, somewhat playful way), and the Māori rubbing of noses greeting (my dad used to do it playfully to me when I was little, as a goofy sign of affection - but he was a merchant marine who’s been around and always talked about these incredible strange places).   In Russian, “абориген” may have a broader geographic meaning than what would be culturally accepted by the native people, and is often used in pop culture as such (as an example, a very famous Vysotksi song goes “ну почему аборигены съели Кука” - “why did the aboriginals ate Captain Cook” - and I assure you not one of us would know if the native people of the Cook Islands would refer to themselves as aboriginal).

x6i2cl,,Should President Biden attend the 2022 FIFA World Cup?,alittledanger,,18,0.88,2022-09-05 14:51:13
in6umtx,t3_x6i2cl,"The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.

For context to all the non-footy fans here. The 2022 FIFA World Cup will be held in Qatar from November 22nd to December 18th. 

The US qualified after disastrously missing the 2018 World Cup in Russia and will be in Group B with Wales, England, and Iran. There are seven other groups for a total of 32 teams. Each team plays the other teams in their group once and the top two teams in each group advance to the knockout rounds. The U.S. has advanced to the knockout rounds in three of the last five World Cups. 

Just to start off, the **TL;DR version** is that there are many pros and cons to visiting as it is a very controversial tournament. 

I personally, am against the President visiting as it is an absurdity that they were even able to host. 

**Arguments in favor:** 

* The U.S., together with Mexico and Canada, is hosting the next World Cup in 2026. Usually, the heads of state for the following World Cup host country at least attend the final, if not matches involving their country. 
* The U.S. team is actually really talented. This is probably the most talented team the U.S. has ever had with many players playing at the top professional levels in Europe. Plus, with a very manageable group, a run to the quarter-finals is not out of the question. Winning the whole thing is very unlikely though. 
* The World Cup is probably the biggest sporting event on the planet. The Olympics get similar eyeballs, but countries don't get brought to a standstill over someone winning the Gold Medal in fencing. They do when their national team is playing in the World Cup though. 
* Biden recently designated Qatar a [major non-NATO ally](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-designates-qatar-major-non-nato-ally-us-2022-03-10/). Not attending might be seen as a snub, especially if the U.S. gets far into the knockout rounds. 
* Qatar also has one of the largest U.S. military bases overseas. It's always nice to visit the troops. 
* They have a lot of oil and gas, something the west needs now because of the Ukraine crisis. 
* We are playing not one, but *two* British teams, England and Wales (the four U.K. nations compete separately in soccer). It would be a good time to meet with the new U.K. PM Liz Truss. 
* Iran is also in our group. It might be a good opportunity to meet with them to revive an Iran Nuclear Deal. 
* It's after the midterms. 

**Arguments Against:**

* Qatar almost certainly bribed FIFA officials to get the bid. A World Cup, it should be noted, the U.S., along with Australia, Japan, and South Korea, was also bidding for. 
* FIFA is an incredibly corrupt organization that the DOJ launched a massive anti-corruption probe against in 2015. It has improved a little bit under their current President Gianni Infantino, but not much in my opinion. He has also been repeatedly singing Qatar's praises lately. 
* There is a possibility that Iran will engage in all sorts of absurd political shenanigans around our match with them.
* Qatar has been accused of [massive labor exploitation](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/23/revealed-migrant-worker-deaths-qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022) to build new stadiums for the tournament. At least 6,500 workers, most of whom were expat workers from South Asian countries, have died. The ones who live are subject to substandard living conditions, often have their passports taken away, and are not always paid like they were promised. In addition to having to work long hours in scorching Arabian heat. 
* Qatar has also been accused of [funding terrorist organizations](https://apnews.com/article/islamic-state-group-religion-syria-lawsuits-middle-east-75e15fcfc4b2c0dcdd18ff16e2556a20) or at least looking the other way when it comes to funding terrorism. It's alleged that the half-brother of the Emir may have sent money to ISIS, including to the ISIS ""judge"" who ordered the murder of two American journalists. 
* Qatar is a country where homosexuality is illegal and subject to harsh penalties. 
* Qatar is not a democracy but an authoritarian regime where basic human rights are not upheld. 
* It has a bit of a Fyre-festival vibe. They don't have enough hotel rooms and the size of the country means that there will be fans everywhere, as opposed to being spread out as they would be in other countries. 
* Like all major events, there is always a risk of a terrorist attack. 
* It is also during Thanksgiving. Our match against England will be on Black Friday.

Lots of rate statistics are capped the way that NFL passer rating is. FICO is the best example.

> Whether or artificial game 7 moments should exist will be debated till the end of time but its not like the best team wins all the time in stick and ball sports either.

The Big 4 sports in America all have unbalanced schedules. It's not like the Premier League (or most other major soccer leagues) where every team plays every team the same amount of times. I assume you're using W-L record for ""best team"" but that's just not how those sports work. Playoffs make sense from a game perspective because teams can have lopsided strength of schedule, especially the NFL. Often a team will walk into the playoffs on a cupcake schedule and promptly get annihilated by a team with a worse record that had run into better teams in the regular season. That's what happened to the Cowboys last season, and the Cowboys in 2022. That's also why a decent amount of media, fans, etc. picked the Cowboys to lose.

Strength of schedule is not a thing in NASCAR because it's not a 1v1 sport. You're going against everybody every week for a whole season. There's no reason to have playoffs.

That's the whole reason why complaints and discussion about the format have not gone away in 20 years, and this specific format for 10 years, that Big 4 fans don't complain about. Ravens fans weren't telling people to throw out the format last year - they looked unbeatable, but they also never played a defense like the Chiefs, and that's what fan disappointment was concentrated on.

Meanwhile, in NASCAR, we see Larson, Byron, Hamlin, Reddick, etc. outperforming Logano most weeks. There's no comparison.",thejjjordan,,12,12,2024-10-21 16:02:12

lt0qn5y,t3_1g8ru5n,"The only way to include DNF's and not have it screw up the results is to sift out DNF's for a driver or team screwup vs. the 'I got collected in the big one' DNF's.  And obviously some of those instances are bound to be subjective instead of objective.

I've never thought that particular variable needed to be included when comparing driver performance.  Also, none of that base data is linked in your analysis either (but I take your word for it lol)",PantherChicken,,11,11,2024-10-21 15:37:56
lt0vxmr,t3_1g8ru5n,"I understand what you mean, but I find your methodology to be pretty useless in regards to comparing years and generations of cars. As you noted, your formula kind of gets trampled when you don't have the same drivers running up front every weekend, and with the unprecedented amount of parity so far this season, you could honestly spin this post as ""More parity in the cup series than ever!"" and make it a positive.

This is a cool way to compare drivers over the course of one season, but is a terrible way to make an assumption that Logano is worse than any other driver from any other season. For example, you don't note that by your data, Ryan Newman (ranked 10th) in 2014, MTJ (ranked 11th) in 2015, and Carl Edwards (ranked 10th) in 2016 are all as bad, if not worse, than Logano when compared to their competition.

It's also maybe not a great idea to include Round of 8 drivers in this methodology when comparing them to *just* Championship 4 drivers over the years. I would assume that Ryan Blaney, for example, probably clears other Round of 8 drivers from the past ten years such as 2022 Chase Briscoe, 2018 Aric Almirola, or even 2023 Chris Buescher after his run of great results.

Not to go full baseball but we need to consider adjusting for eras in regards to things like this. Gen 7 racing is way too different in performance level than at any point in the history of this sport.

lt1ximg,t3_1g8ru5n,"1 - As soon as the championship changed to ""win and you are in"" teams changed how they raced.  The reason NASCAR had to add in a bonus for winning the ""regular"" season was because otherwise there was no real advantage to winning after the first one.  MTJ proved this when he maximized stage wins over actual wins and built a huge lead in playoff points.....and won the championship.

2 - For the last few years there has been a consistent trend of Ford teams starting VERY slowly.  They put a ton of effort into Daytona and then basically suck for 8-12 weeks before winning in the second half of the year.  First for win for a Ford this year was race 13.  After that Ford won 7 of 13, 8 of 14 if you include the all star race.  Ford has won 3 of 7 playoff races with Chevy winning the others.  Toyota won 5 of the first 13 and 2 of the last 13 in the regular season.  Zero playoff wins.  Ford correctly deduced that winning in the playoffs had a higher payoff.  

3 - The comparison to stick and ball is inappropriate because in stick and ball a loss is forever.  In NASCAR only a win is forever.  College football is 12 games in the regular season.  If you go 0-11 in the first 11 games and then win the last one it doesnt matter one single bit, you are not getting into the playoffs.  Not so in NASCAR.  See Harrison Burton.  We can argue if that is right or wrong but it is the way the playoffs are structured right now.  Therefore, any metric using stick and ball statistics is useless.  You could win every one of the first 26 races and not even make it to the round of 12.  Look at Harvick in 2020 - clearly the dominate driver all year he missed the Championship 4 because of wrecking and finishing 16th and 17th in the last two races before the final.  Alternately, he missed the final because he finished second in the first race of the round of 4.  Who did he lose to?  Joey Logano.  Who won the Championship? Joey Logano.  If Harvick beats Joey in the first race, wrecking in the next two doesnt matter.  But just that ONE position was the difference between in and out.  Oh and it was the difference TWICE because Harvick missed the cut by...one point.  


Trying to jam the NASCAR championship system into stick and ball statistics is futile.

lt0xbet,t3_1g8ru5n,"Crazy that you put hours of work into this just to mostly receive meme replies (maybe because it’s repetitive for some idk). 

I’ll start this by saying I think Reddick is the driver that most deserves the championship this year. Watched Larson wreck way too many times for it to be anyone else but Reddick. 

I’ll bring up one point I haven’t seen mentioned yet, stage racing. I can’t back it up with numbers (don’t have quick access) but I imagine the only reason logano is still in is due to stage points accumulated throughout the season. *One could argue that Logano would have a higher average finish if he was not chasing stage points on mediocre days.* 

I despise stage racing and stage points. A car that runs 16th-20th all day can sacrifice their finishing position for points that *absolutely make a difference in the playoffs.* I would argue this format heavily favors the top 3 teams, as they are more likely to already be “locked in” to the playoffs and have the leeway to go for stage points. Compared to a team like front row where they need to try to position themselves for a win because the points won’t matter. 

I don’t know why mediocre cars have the chance to gain such a high amount of points through stage racing, it feels disingenuous to the sake of competition. Not really even trying to position yourselves to win the race, just be in x position 60% through the race.

Which is true, but in almost every major sport there’s a best of series between 2 teams to determine the champion. In football, you have 4 quarters to put a team away or make a come back. In NASCAR, you can cut a tire, get wrecked, or blow up and your entire season is over 5 laps into the championship race. Or you can have a 10 second lead and a car not in contention can have an issue or stop on track to cause a caution (looking at you Sammy Smith) and your entire lead is wiped out.

lt22p2v,t3_1g8ru5n,"Well NASCAR is a lot more than just a *driver* sport, isn’t it?

Where are the metrics talking about crew chief ability? Pit call success rate? Pit crew average stop time? Pit crew error percentage?

I think a lot of us would prefer a system different than what we have. Hell I’d even settle for this system if they added a 3 race championship round, rather than one race. But they haven’t. So this post just comes off as childish and immature. “Whining” for lack of a better term. 

There’s plenty of seasons in the “old era” where you could argue the best driver didn’t win the championship. 1996 comes to mind when Gordon got beat out by Labonte. Gordon won a ton of races but also DNF’d a lot in the races he didn’t win. Labonte scores more points. 

The point is, the system is the same for everyone. The drivers and teams all play by the same rules. 

Las Vegas, in my opinion, is THE perfect example of why this system IS so great. That was a team win. Joey Logano didn’t win that race. Paul Wolfe won that race. And that’s EXACTLY why you can never count out the 22 team. Joey is a great driver who just rises to the occasion. And Paul is a crew chief who does the same. The moment I heard that Joey was back in, I said he was making it to the Champ 4. They’re too good in these situations. And I knew they would win Vegas. I wasn’t surprised at all. That’s what they do. And that’s what’s great about this system. You come on when it counts and you get rewarded for it. All of the teams have the same ability to do it. 

Remember, Larson was on track to finish what 3rd in points in 2021 until a late caution? His team won him that championship.

lt1uruk,t3_1g8ru5n,"This is a really great post, and thank you for putting so much time and effort into it. 

If you’re interested in refining the process to more accurately determine driver performance, I think you shouldn’t ignore driver rating. It’s true that finishing position is a big factor in driver rating, but it also accounts for average running position, passes, fast laps, etc. I think it’s a better descriptor of driver performance than results alone. 

DNF stats are really tough. A single season is just not that long (in terms of sample size), and DNFs are highly random. For example, how many races was Logano running well in and either didn’t finish or had a poor finish due to a random occurrence that had nothing to do with his own performance? I don’t know the answer outright, but that would be another way to refine driver performance stats. 

If you have a hypothetical driver who leads every lap and absolutely dominates the field but gets wrecked by lapped cars battling in the last quarter of the race and finishes 35th, that will greatly skew your measure of driver performance in a deceptive way. 

Another very important thing to consider is the weight used in calculating QBR. Blindly applying the same weights won’t necessarily give you usable data, because NASCAR is very different than NFL. 

For example, you’re using T10/starts with the same weights as completions/attempts, and points with yards. Do elite drivers have a T10:start rate that compares with elite QBs and completion:attempts? And a QB might throw for 300 yards. Rarely will they only throw for 50 yards. So yards and points are very much not interchangeable. To create a truly usable metric, you would need to establish weights that are NASCAR-specific, not NFL-specific.

To me, the legitimate champion is the one who played by the rules and came out on top, overall performance compared to the field be damned. No amount of questioning the legitimacy of any champion’s championship will remove the trophy from their record.

lt3gt8i,t3_1g8ru5n,"u/HistoricalHeight9670 Good work, I highly appreciate the amount of work you put into this, and agree with many of your points, especially about how often the best team doesn’t win the title in stick & ball sports, which doesn’t get talked about I suppose because playoffs have always existed in them and so people take it as a slight to “tradition” to criticize them.

I do however want to say that these ratings can sometimes not be truly representative of performance, because racing has such an element of chance in it that can make a driver’s results not nearly as good as their performance (For instance, Chase’s 2020 is highly underrated because he was incredibly unlucky for much of the year), and that’s why there is no such thing as a perfect championship system, because unless you have a ridiculously large sample size, there’s always going to be results that aren’t representative, even in a full-season system. 

Nevertheless, this system is a joke that doesn’t even begin to try to get the right result, making literally only one race matter. Imagine if David Starr doesn’t bring out that late caution in 2021. No offense to Truex, but that’s an outcome that would have put 1985, 1996, & 2003 to shame. The only years where I’d say the “right” champion has happened unambiguously in the playoff format was ‘14, ‘17, & ‘21 (I think it was right in ‘19 & ‘20 too, but those can certainly be argued). ",AnemicRoyalty10,,1,1,2024-10-22 00:21:23

lt2teqc,t3_1g8ru5n,"Respect the effort put into this. Given we have a playoff format, I don't think it's fair to say an underdog going in statically can't win or an underdog winning is bad for the sport. Other sports have upsets from low seeds in the playoffs and its usually well received.

My feelings are the drivers championship and owners championship should follow two different formats.

Drivers championship should be awarded to the driver with the most points at the end of the full season. Plain and simple. Winston Cup style if you want to think of it that way.

The playoffs should be marketed as just the Team championship (owners championship as we know it now). 16 best teams after 26 races, head-to-head for a 10-week playoff stretch. If you want to continue to give playoff bonus points during the season, I'm ok with some advantage to the top seeds.

If you want to go deeper, read on...

I have mixed feelings if win and your in should stay or go for qualification. I'm totally fine if a team wants to run multiple drivers in their car during the playoffs since it's a team championship. It's like an NFL team switching out the quarterback. Doesn't matter who the quarterback was as long as the team wins.

I think back to when Chase Elliott was injured. He didn't make the drivers playoffs but his team was in the owners championship. Seemed like TV ignored this fact. Probably cause they didn't want to confuse the casual fan with the two different concurrent playoff races. The interesting part is the owners championship is the one that pays out the big money but all we talk about is the drivers championship. The emphasis should be on where the money is.

I think this dual format also helps solve the waiver situation... Just get rid of it. Since the playoffs are based on team, it doesn't matter which driver is in the car and how many races they ran during the regular season. If a driver misses a race or more, all it does is decrease their full season championship odds. It still doesn't eliminate them though. Using Larson as the example, he missed a race and still has a great shot at the championship when the points are totaled over the full season. Which I'm fine with. If you run 35 of 36 races and still cover the field, you still deserve to be champion IMO.

Looking back, should Kyle have been drivers champion the year he missed substantial time due to a leg injury? IMO no. This format solves that. He could still come back and help the team win the team championship, but the drivers' championship would go to the driver with the most points at the end of the season. Which wouldn't have been him under this proposed format. I think that is fair.

I could do with or without the elimination every 3 races and limiting to a final 4 eligible for the championship. For simplicity, my vote would be do without elimination. Make it the most points after 10 races like the original Sprint Cup playoff format was. After a few races, a few teams will probably be mathematically eliminated and that's fine. They don't deserve to be in the conversation. A team with bad luck early could go on a streak to win the championship. Odds of 15 cars being mathematically out of contention before the final race due to the dominance of one team is probably pretty low. But if that were to happen, that team sounds more than deserving of the championship.

Depending on how the points play out, you could be able to market both the drivers and team championships in the final race if both are not mathematically clinched.

During the playoffs, because it is a team format, highlight the crews and their part in a championship run. It isn't just the driver that wins or loses a championship. The pressure is on the whole team for those 10 weeks. I like on some broadcasts they highlight the crew members of a given team. Always interesting to hear their backgrounds. I also like to see the performance compared with detailed analytics. Does the best team stay hot on pit road? Does an underdog team win the latest battle on pit road? Who has been the best all year (average) or best in the last few races to watch to remain hot? Who has been best on the given day?



Unrelated rants, I'm OK with no caution for the end of stages at any track if you still want to award performance at points during a race. I'm also for no overtime or restricting it to a single overtime attempt. I hate the long delays just to get the race concluded from multiple overtime attempts. If you didn't have overtime, rightfully as the best car at that point in the race, Austin Dillon wins under caution at Richmond and we don't have the controversy that played out. I'm pretty sure IndyCar is this way and I don't hear complaints. If there is a caution late in the race with enough time to restart and you basically have an aggressive restart at the end, that's fine, but let's no encourage it with the unlimited overtime restarts. I think it's also dumb when the unlimited overtime restarts go so long that cars start running out of fuel when no crew chief would realistically plan to run 30 laps beyond scheduled distance as a winning strategy.

TV will also finish within their window and not have to switch networks (unless there is a rain delay which can't be avoided). This leaves plenty of time for post-race analysis and driver interviews. Nice to hear the raw emotions after the race from many drivers. I hate to see the driver interview on the front stretch and TV signs off due to being over time. Might also consistently afford TV the time to go back to interviewing the driver once they get out of the car in victory lane with the team.",aj333888,,0,0,2024-10-21 22:01:29

gvvhg5f,t3_myfooq,"I'll always remember 2007 for the Orange Box. Even though I didn't even play it till well into 2008 lol. It was right before I really got into PC gaming, and I bought the Orange Box not realizing my computer was too weak to play it at the time, and having no knowledge of how to upgrade. But the next year I finally did and that's when I went back and played a bunch of these famous games that came out this year.

not to mention that the Orange Box blew my mind over a fairly long period of time. Again, being new to PC gaming I literally had never heard of Team Fortress or Half Life before. I only bought the thing because I saw a trailer for Portal somewhere and it blew my mind, (I was really into like 4th dimensional shenanigans and such at the time) and I really wanted it. So I bought and installed all the games on the package just to play portal. And after doing so I felt satisfied with my purchase and I didn't touch the other games for a while. Eventually I tried TF2 and I was surprised how much I loved it and ended up getting way into that for a few hundred hours worth of gameplay. And then after another year or two I finally was like, ""so what's with this half life business then"" and ended up getting obsessed with those games as well. And that's what got me to try out a bunch of other shooters like Bioshock and Mass Effect and so on down the line. 

So like the Orange box wasn't just a one-time ""oh man this is a great deal"" thing for me, it was a fairly extensive part of my introduction to an entire other genre of gaming over the course of several years thanks to how slowly I ended up trying out each of the games on it.",BlazeDrag,,105,105,2021-04-25 23:57:37

gvvc1cn,t3_myfooq,"2007 was the year I really got into videogames. I had played plenty of games prior to that, but mostly just as a thing to pass the time or do when my friends couldn't get together to play (I was born in 1994, so only just turned 13 at the end of that September) or the weather was bad. I had also never really been exposed to PC gaming beyond games like Age of Mythology, Stronghold, the Tycoon games, etc. and had virtually no experience with online multiplayer outside of some Halo 2 stuff while Xbox Live subscription lasted. 

But then 2007 hit and I had games like CoD 4 and Halo 3 for my Xbox which were not only fun to play by myself, but really felt like the turning point for and rise of online console multiplayer. All my friends were playing those games and it was the first time I really got into gaming as a group/communal thing and not just something I did on my own. And my mom also happened to pick up a job at Hollywood Video for some extra money right around this time, so I was able to take advantage of the free game rentals to suddenly start playing games like Bioshock, Assassin's Creed, Mass Effect, and even Rock Band.

And one of the most important ""games"" I got around that time was The Orange Box which introduced me to Valve and really made me more aware of PC gaming and served as my gateway to that side of gaming, aided by Steam which allowed me to explore a nice sized back catalog of PC games I had never been exposed to prior. 

Was quite honestly the best gateway year for video gaming you could have hoped for.

gvw6kko,t3_myfooq,"I don’t think there’s ever going to be another year that stands up to 2007, at least for me. It wasn’t even about the games I personally played—I had a PS3 and a Wii, so I didn’t play any of the 360 exclusives until a bit later—but more about the sheer volume of excitement surrounding all these releases. Gaming hasn’t really felt as momentous since.

This was back when G4 was still a thing, so between Attack of the show, X-Play, and their E3 coverage—as well as websites like GameSpot and IGN—I feel like I was being constantly inundated with coverage of all these super exciting new games. The Halo 3 launch was such an insanely huge deal that I even felt the hype despite not being able to play it. Ratchet & Clank Future was a massive graphical leap for probably my favorite franchise at the time, and Uncharted blew my mind with its realistic graphics. I also have fond memories of Crysis: watching the glowing reviews coming in and then getting a physical copy of the game for my birthday. My mom yelled at me because I was so focused on installing the game that I ignored my family.

And Assassin’s Creed? Jesus. People always dunk on the first game—and it definitely doesn’t hold up—but that game absolutely blew my mind. I think it was the first truly open-world game I’d ever played, and it might also have been the first true stealth game I’d ever played. I was just enthralled by the world, and as a 13 year-old kid I thought Altair was the coolest character ever.

And finally, Super Mario Galaxy. What a magical game. To this day I’m not sure any gaming experience has matched the sheer joy of launching that thing for the first time.

Maybe what I really miss is a time in my life where I was so carefree that video games felt like the most important things in it. But still, when I think of my happiest gaming memories, most of them are from 2007.",Pants_for_Bears,,12,12,2021-04-26 03:58:11

The Burning Crusade took everything about WoW and made it better, IMO.

It's when gaming became a culture rather than an escape. More DLCs, more patch fixes, and that year saw an explosion of video game players through Call of Duty. It's the year developers realized the potential in releasing mostly-finished games and saw the rise of microtransactions in abundance, and the year that games started to trend toward more cinematic experiences with flashy eye candy, longer tutorial sections, less player agency, and all that. It was the year that ushered in the sequel-on-sequel formulaic releases, where AAA titles would become very one note because taking risks was too big a concern and became too costly. The year of franchises, where we still see games under the same name that are developed, produced, and released to the public even today.

An excellent year for games, but also the start of a homogenized direction for video games, gaming culture became more important than actual gaming, and gave rise to raw corporatism in the gaming sphere.",icounternonsense,,2,2,2021-04-26 03:52:54

It is at least somewhat good to hear this from someone. It shows (at least for me) that there is some sort of comprehensive changes/reforms happening.


For example, Japan understands that its geography in case of an invasion is extremely difficult to defend, because an incursion would be from the sea, from west to east or vice versa, not from south to North. Being all in all 300km in width. So they have opted for small and “toylike” military weapons, that are light enough to retreat, small enough to blend in mountains and hide, and can maneuver on old bridges/canyons/mountains… 




So if someone has already somewhat prepared a defense strategy for situations like this, we can as well. And it’s good that there is a military objective that surrounds it.",lmsoa941,,6,6,2024-06-07 13:18:28

I am an American who went to Paris 2024, and I had an incredible time. Every game I attended felt well organized. Crowd control in and out felt mostly well handled except for football. We stayed in a hotel a block away from the main Metro line for the venues so it was easy to get around. The frequency of trains departing after each game made it so we never felt crowd crushed.

Compared to my other trips to Paris, I was surprised how not crowded it was in the city. Sure, there were bottlenecks from Olympic traffic, but the usual city attractions like the Louvre felt empty. My understanding is a lot of locals skipped town and a lot of usual tourists also avoided coming to Paris due to the hiked up prices on hotel and travel.

I’m not going to pretend everything is hunky dory at the Olympics because I had a nice time. I know there a lot of problems that come with hosting the games, and I appreciated your insight as a local. I still left feeling very inspired by the comradely shared between nations and the collective spirit that you could really feel at each game. I am from Los Angeles, and I am hopeful my city will succeed at hosting in 2028. I am also prepared for all the drama that will come with it.

Paulina Paszek was very promising sprint canoeist, but in 2018 at 21 year old she suffered an injury and got written off. Soon after she left to work in Germany and was convinced there to return to sport. With the support she obtained she managed to overcome her injury and return to high performance in 2021, representing Germany since then. In Paris she won a bronze in K-2 500 m sprint and silver medal in K-4 500 m (canoe sprint of 2 and 4 women team). Polish team got fourth place in K-4 500 m and didn't qualify for finals of K-2 500 m.

There was also another drama in fencing. In dramatic finish with winning point in last 4 seconds (and subsequent vigorous celebration which went viral) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTlxVpUbHuo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTlxVpUbHuo) Polish women team won bronze medal in fencing (team épée). Afterwards in public interview they discussed nepotism and poor organization ot polish fencing association, which resulted in huge fallout in media.

Daria Pikulik won silver medal in omnium event (track cycling). Two days before, in an interview she complained about notorious polish cycling association (they are a drama on their own, or rather a trainwreck), a body (ir)responsible for her preparation. She said that cyclists did not receive any support and had to basically self-finance, that they got bicycles only 4 months before olympics and clothing the day before the event.

Overall, polish women won 8 medals (1 gold, 3 silver, 4 bronze), while men only 2 (1 silver, 1 bronze). This led to many snarky comments on supremacy of polish sportswomen over polish sportsmen.",megasepulator4096,,12,12,2025-01-15 03:11:39

m83di1c,t3_1i183zw,"Great write up. One missed controversy was the boxers who thought they were female, but unreleased, unspecified tests may have shown them to have male dna. And the one boxer was only tested after beating their opponent who happened to be from the same country as the governing federation.",bardmusic,,2,2,2025-01-20 02:10:53

ma2a7sf,t3_1i183zw,Any write up that starts with a reference to Fatal Bazooka is automatically a contender for best of 2025 as far as I'm concerned. ,opinionated_sloth,,1,1,2025-01-30 19:29:34

vlcckz,,Most iconic game from each world cup?,GauntletTakeshi,,68,0.97,2022-06-26 19:26:59
idussh4,t3_vlcckz,"I think you could make a case for 2018 to be France 4-3 Argentina. It had the goal of the tournament in Pavard and it had Mbappe coming of age as France announced themselves on the world stage and lived up to their tag of favourites to win. Also had a worldie goal from Angel Di Maria and Messi being sent home early at yet another world cup. To top it all off, this was the first knockout stage game of 2018 and set the tone for the dramatic remainder of the tournament",dead_trim_mcgee1,,24,24,2022-06-26 21:46:05
idw5ll9,t3_vlcckz,That 2014 game... I could not believe what I was watching,PSUHiker31,,21,21,2022-06-27 04:32:42
idvkaqt,t3_vlcckz,great list. however my preference for the 2018 wc would be the 4-3 france-argentina game but agree with everything else,nighthawkz_2002,,14,14,2022-06-27 01:26:58
iduuesd,t3_vlcckz,A very personal preference: for me 2006 Argentina x Mexico. The sheer beauty of play left me in tears. I couldn't bear to see either team go out.,TekaLynn212,,13,13,2022-06-26 21:58:22
