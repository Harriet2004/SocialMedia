lf75tqs,t3_1edhvde,"Nagayama and Garrigos were in a chokehold position when the referee made a ‚ÄúMate‚Äù call.

In judo, a ‚ÄúMate‚Äù (Wait) is a call for temporary stop or ‚Äúreset‚Äù of a match; contestants are supposed to release a hold, then the referee gives the ‚ÄúHajime‚Äù (Start) call and the match is resumed.

In this particular moment, while Nagayama already relaxed his strength, Garrigos continued to hold his choke for 3-4 seconds more after the ‚ÄúMate‚Äù call, which deemed a foul play and a dangerous act in judo. 

Eventually Garrigos let go. Nagayama got up, straightened his clothes and was ready to resume his match. However, since Nagayama relaxed his defense then appeared to pass out for a few seconds, instead of resuming the match, the referee instantly awarded Garrigos an ‚Äúippon‚Äù, essentially made him the winner of the match and ended Nagayama‚Äôs run for gold medal in Paris 2024.


.



*Edit: There were opinions that attempted to justify Garrigos‚Äô decision to maintain his choke. However, the majority of r/judo agreed with the above explanation of a ‚Äúmate‚Äù call and that Garrigos was in the wrong for not releasing. Later, Garrigos also came out, not to defend his right to hold the choke, but to claim that he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt hear the mate call due to noisy audience‚Äù.*

*Also, some trolls such as u/ShakaUVM are trying to tell me it‚Äôs ‚Äúmatte/ ÂæÖ„Å£„Å¶‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmate/ ÂæÖ„Å¶‚Äù, since ‚Äúmate‚Äù is ‚Äúincorrect Japanese‚Äù??!

I am very confident that the Spaniard  - if there was a Matte call - he did not hear it. I've competed 15 years in judo, wrestling and BJJ and I tell you that a small crowd yelling make things very complicated, especially when you are in the ground with all your reserve tank invested in a choke. It's all in, tunnel vision. 

There are two tatamis in the stadium, it was packed and judo referees are known for not getting too close and not putting themselves in the middle to stop like BJJ or other contact sports do. They are not used to chokes.

Just to be clear, a choke in judo if the referee interpretates that it is well secured, irrespective of the opponent tapping or passing out, they can and normally call an ippon. It sucks, an armbar is different but chokes, judo don't want people passing out in their tatamis, especially an international event.

I recall a wrestling competition where my opponent stopped because the tatami next to me the ref called something, he stopped and I took him down. He complained and the realised of the mistake.

Rule number one, don't stop until you clearly see with your eyes the ref action. If you are choking someone, you are not looking at the ref. If there is a call and you are the one being submitted, make it clear that you are releasing. It's basic.

This is not BJJ or UFC. Judo have been amending rules multiple times to differentiate from other sports such as wrestling. It's anal, I stop practicing competitive judo for that reason, it became an absolutely pain in the ass to practice and compete. The moment that they stopped legs primary attack because wrestlers were dominating, it killed the sport.

I am very confident that I'll get a lot of hate here, but this is judo and the Japanese was too naive, or too confident that he would get his way. You defend until the opponent stop, even if you hear a call.",Confident_Tomato16,,16,16,2024-07-27 20:12:39

Ah French 18th and 19th century was really wild.

Here it's about the birth of democracy and people find it distasteful. Don't get me wrong, it was extremely awkward for the French public too, but the whole show was balancing around the issues in our cultures. It wasn't a neutral choice, just like the opening bit in the metro that stops working, the grim catacomb segment right after, or even the retrospective of the history of the Olympics while the mechanic horse ran on the Seine river (which was pretty tense). Same thing for the ""threesome"", the drag show, etc...

So yes, the English opening was classy and proper, humourous and family friendly. The French one decided to be honest about culture. Christians crying over the Last Supper don't want to see that some people have to conquer their right to have a spiritual life. They can only think it's a mockery that targets *them*, and they don't want those artists to share their history. The period of the Enlightenment was full of Castras who ported religious chants to their higher point, and this poses no problem today. Royals enjoyed the company of dwarfs and all kinds of ""odd"" persons. John the Apostle leaned on the torso of Jesus, and what should we think about the history of Saint Sebastian? All of that is not secret, this is very well known and it adorns Saint Peters in Rome, alongside many provocative artworks. And if I'm even more honest, the English we see here aren't the last one to be offensive in the open, but that's a problem between France and England I guess...",Intelligent_Pie_9102,,2,2,2024-07-27 10:45:15

ldx1ys9,t3_1e6ujga,"[Team USA](https://imgur.com/a/FNCgYTP), 2024, will be wearing a blazer - blue with red/white trim on lapels and wrists - with blue & white striped dress shirt. Fine. .

 And faded blue jeans, not fine. 

The top half says ""I respect this ceremony"".  The bottom half says ""psyche!""

I wouldn't be so hard on it if the tone was the same up and down.  If the top half is formal, the bottom half should also be formal.  

Granted that's my opinion and I'm not a fashion guru.  

Looking at the past opening ceremony outfits, I'm fine with the formal blazer and white pants/skirts.  Kind of boring but acceptable.  The track suits are fine.  Hard to tell from any other nation with red, white and blue flag colors. 

For the 1980 winter Olympics, USA went with the [cowboy look](https://imgur.com/a/gzCRUtm). Not many may know this but Calgary is the ""cowboy capitol"" of Canada and has a famous rodeo.  The USA team uniform was a nice nod to that.   

The USA's [2014 winter Olympic ceremony outfit](https://imgur.com/a/6UxAUGo) was awesome. It's playful, but well made and there's unity in style from top to bottom.  No one would look at it and think ""I wonder what country is that one?""",Pablois4,,2,2,2024-07-19 12:10:01

I have one issue with this.

Nike, ok, so this is a big year for them with their athletic gear because of the Olympics. So if you are looking to outfit your hometown ""league"" with Nike apparel, you are getting whatever it is they are producing this year which is primarily cut like the Olympic kits. 

Here's the problem. My daughter is a competitive state level swimmer in high school. Her team opted for the Nike suits this season in part because they're kids and they wanna be like the Olympians. So we get the suits in and hand them out to everyone. Everyone goes home and obviously they all wanna try them on. My daughter puts hers on and screams. I come running up to her room and she shows me the suit and what it looks like on. Jesus Christ! The back was going right up her crack and the sides were pretty revealing. This wasn't a fit issue, this was done on purpose and it felt really dirty. Couple that with the fact that most Olympians are teenagers or barely in their 20s.  

The next day it was a unanimous opinion of the entire team and we had to quickly scramble to get a new set of suits. We learned a week or two later that this was an issue in several sports including gymnastics, water polo, track and field etc. Surprise surprise, those are the sports that typically produce the ""model"" types in the Olympics. 

As a dad with teenage daughters, I think it's gross making kids look sexy in their uniforms, especially on a world stage like the Olympics.",fullspeed8989,,1,1,2024-07-19 16:42:01

Respect now.

I‚Äôve been to Europe past couple of years from Paris, Rome, London, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Prague, Venice, Florence, Munich.

In terms of aesthetics I will probably give you Prague and Edinburgh, but Paris with still having architectural beauty and  history was arguably the best out of the big cities like Rome and London and arguably might be my favorite European city.

I feel people out too much expectations about the whole cringe ‚Äúromance‚Äù stereotype, but if you just enjoy the city, go the Lourve, treaty of Versailles, around Eiffel Towerz, various museums and walk the streets it literally like the European version of New York and tbh even bigger.

I know a lot of architecture maybe isn‚Äôt as original as mid evil times but you really feel it‚Äôs history when you walk the main parts of the cities.

It‚Äôs a nice city that is old and also new and it blends well for my opinion.

I guess I can argue Prague because I think it has best architecture and had great food for me, but it is more touristy.

And Rome was also a great experience with the Vatican alone which probably is greatest man made church and thing I‚Äôve seen with it‚Äôs scale and I like the more gritty feel but it‚Äôs just doesn‚Äôt feel as grand as Paris.

Paris is just huge and it‚Äôs history and culture seems to blend well. I know it‚Äôs prett my touristy still, but for me it felt like what I feel when I go to NY many times living near there.

Paris is a world class city and one thing I realize is how much shot it got for not being perfect, but even with its imperfections it‚Äôs arguably one of the greatest cities in the world.",FarTangelo9276,,5,5,2024-08-13 04:02:29

2. Get a bedbug cover for your mattress (pricey but worth it). Bedbugs often live in your mattress but they can't penetrate this cover.

I hadn't seen a bedbug before, but when I googled it, I realized I had some work ahead of me. 

When I told my landlord (lived in an apartment and apparently they came from the people upstairs as their infestation was the worst), she at first tried to play them down as carpet beetles. When I assured her they were in fact bedbugs, she called the exterminator, and they were dealt with. I, of course, washed everything I had and picked apart my bed.

They often use liberalism as a pretext to generalize and ridicule people of faith. Yet, they have the audacity to police language and opinions to ensure it suits their narrative. What happened to the principles of equality and equity that you claim to champion, yet so readily abandon when dealing with those you disagree with?

Many of you have defended what is clearly a parody of Jesus and his apostles through imitations of 'The Last Supper,' offending millions of people worldwide. It seems you do not regard those with religious values as deserving of respect. However, you resort to hyperbole and further generalizations, claiming that billions of religious people globally are out to oppress and kill gay individuals, portraying them as a relentless mob. These sensationalized, outdated views are used to justify your exclusive morality, which you reserve only for those who share your mindset. Isn't this hypocritical, considering others evil for being selective with their morality, while you justify your own selectivity?

What happened to mutual respect and acceptance? I have not seen any major global events like the Olympic opening ceremony parodying gay and trans people through analogies like 'The Death of Hyacinth.' If that were to happen, I would be among the first to denounce it as offensive and disrespectful towards those identifying as LGBTQ+. Yet, can we expect the same sensitivity from you?

I am not Christian myself, but I felt that it simply wasn't right. The Olympics are meant to unify, not divide or make political statements about any group. Although I did not resonate with the heavy LGBTQ+ undertones of the ceremony, I would have looked back on it with contentment had it not included the offensive display of what many consider holy.

There is no justifiable reason or excuse for such an act. The creative directors were undoubtedly aware of their actions and how they might be perceived, even if insulting Christianity was not their intent. Yet, they chose to proceed, aiming to burn bridges rather than build them.

Why not depict a scene showing people from all walks of life ‚Äî old, young, disabled, of color, white, LGBTQ+, straight, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and others ‚Äî walking the catwalk in their representative attire and cultures? This would demonstrate coexistence and inspire acceptance. Instead, why alienate a significant portion of the global population, which extends beyond the Western world, while also beautifully showcasing French culture and its diversity?

Why defend ridiculing one group to uplift another? Why not strive to uplift everyone, thus paving the way for greater acceptance worldwide? Or do some of you believe that mocking what half the world considers sacred is a quicker route to gaining acceptance?

Do not become a mouthpiece for the extreme left or right. Both extremes benefit from keeping people divided and claiming exclusive righteousness. True righteousness exists quietly among those who choose not to consciously offend any group based on race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, or religion, regardless of their personal beliefs.

But I found this depiction insulting. I am not offended personally, I like many books and art, which criticise Christianity and writers who were almost excommunicated. For example there is a great book (and others) by the greek author Kazantzakis, the last temptation, in which the author depicts Jesus as a human falling in love, being afraid, lying etc. This is art and liberty.


The Olympic opening ceremony is an athletic celebration with artistic events to welcome everyone. How could we claim to be inclusive when we discriminate a religion? No ones religion should be a caricature, unless others are too, or else this is a discrimination for those that believe.¬†

My main issue is that with young children I think it‚Äôs important and difficult to navigate all of this with them in a way that they understand. No one can tell me which way is right or wrong on how to approach sexuality with my child, and the way things have progressed so quickly in the last 10-15 years we have no evidence that there is a good way to explain it to them. 

It is my job as a parent to make sure they understand sexuality in a way that is best for them, and I don‚Äôt need a major event like this shoving it down my child‚Äôs throat and force the issue when either they are not mature or developed enough to understand sexuality.

I don‚Äôt let them watch heterosexuality-driven promiscuity or sexuality edgy things, and I turn on the Olympics with them to watch a nice, once every 2-4 year event as something fun and I can‚Äôt even do that because of the degree things were taken to. I mean for Christ sakes a man‚Äôs testicle was popping out of his shorts.

To think na it only took us 3 years to get another Olympic gold means everything pagdating sa sports landscape natin outside of basketball and volleyball. We need our sports governing bodies to provide all the support possible sa mga atleta natin as well as growing the sport's reach in terms of equipment, coaching, media exposure, etc.

I've seen a lot of people shitting upon puro basketball at volleyball ang iniinvest, but that's mainly MVP providing Gilas and Alas the resources. Kung hindi man tutulong ang PSC/POC, I hope this puts private firms at notice to put more faith in athletes from smaller sports by sponsoring them.

A former teammate of mine is competing this week, and from what he said about the olympic village and the treatment athletes get there is abysmal to the point that many have expressed they desires to leave. That is in comparison to previous summer games. Furthermore, apparently, the IOC liked so much the rules the Japanese implemented in 2021 that they kept most of them for this year, which made the stay in the village akin to a children's summer camp. 

The reality is that unless you have enough money to stay with your coaches outside of the village or are a high-profile athlete and the organisers care about your opinion, you are not having fun at this Olympic village.",cynical_Rad359,,2,2,2024-08-06 13:41:38

It‚Äôs harder if your body isn‚Äôt rested properly or fed properly. 

Hot summer heat in the middle of Paris leaves athletes in olympic village feeling overheated and hot. As a US citizen, this is a common complaint, however, I have even seen tweets and tiktoks of those from Europe also complaining of the lack of ac. Some are fine ofc, but I saw someone sleeping outside on a bench in one photo. 

Netherlands Men‚Äôs Beach Volleyball team decided to enter in a convicted child attacker (potentially three children) to represent them. The country is aware, the olympic committee is aware, and the other athletes are too. He is banned from the village and from the press, however, their performance has allowed them be aired on tv constantly despite this disgusting act! It‚Äôs the worst part of this whole thing. 

As for the Italian and Algerian boxer controversy, it DOES have to do with Paris lol. They have been quiet about the incident and barely shed light on all the hate and false information people have put all over the internet. Why haven‚Äôt they stood up for her? Why haven‚Äôt they addressed people‚Äôs concerns? Whichever way you feel about the situation - Paris still has done little about it. Let me be clear tho - she is a woman and she is a an incredible boxer.

lhb5b86,t3_1enzdcb,"Even as an Indian, I can understand why her disqualification makes sense. The rule exists to prevent wrestlers from artificially inflating their weight with fluids and high-calorie diets after the initial weigh-in.

Let's consider what would happen if this rule were abolished.

Before the first day of the Olympics, athletes might dangerously dehydrate themselves, similar to patients with kidney failure. After the weigh-in, they could then replenish fluids and consume food to significantly increase their weight‚Äîpotentially by more than 5 kg, effectively putting them in a different weight category. This would undermine the purpose of competing in a lower weight category, as it would allow athletes to circumvent the fundamental criteria for participation in that specific category.

In fact, I would even argue that all athletes should be weighed just 10 minutes before their matches to prevent this kind of manipulation after weigh-ins, and to avoid athletes trying to quickly lose weight again the next day.

Her disqualification wasn‚Äôt due to discrimination or some special rule. Another Italian wrestler was disqualified for the same reason. If she were allowed to keep her medal, everyone who was disqualified would likely appeal to the Court of Arbitration.

If there were situations like Chinese swimmers being tested seven times a day while others are tested just once or twice throughout the Olympics, we could argue in her defense. But in this case, the rules were applied fairly.

People need to understand when to support and when to show empathy. Yes I feel bad for her that she lost her medal but I won't support her actions because it's simply not fair for other competitors and the spirit of the game.",Hashira_Oden,,4,4,2024-08-09 17:42:43

If this is overturned it will set a precedent for wrestlers to bulk up significantly after weigh in to gain an advantage and then just fail to make weigh in on Day 2 to guarantee a silver. Secondly, the people she beat also had to make weight on Day 2 for repechage and they all did. This suggests that they probably bulked up less and had less of a weight advantage on Day 1. 

In other words, by failing to make weight on Day 2, Vinesh may have had a very high weight advantage on Day 1 so the DQ might be reasonable.",antipoopsuperstar,,12,12,2024-08-09 14:25:06

Now the rule is same for everyone so that Cuban might also have been overweight during/after/before the match but she made sure that next day morning during weigh in her weight doesn't cross 50 kg so she must not have been too much overweight than Vinesh who must have been more overweight than her in order to go for finals so in this way Vinesh did have unfair advantage over her rival Cuban and she doesn't even deserve silver.,,,1,1,2024-08-09 21:22:55

She beat Susaki, the Ukrainian wrestler and then the Cuban wrestler in the SF, all on the same day. Next day morning she failed the weigh-in by 100 grams and was placed last. 

How did the Cuban wrestler get into the finals? If Phogat was disqualified for all her previous wins then isn't this unfair to Susaki and the Ukrainian wrestler? Can the Olympics committee point out when exactly Phogat gained weight? No. So why would they take in her first two wins, while not considering the SF win, and letting the Cuban wrestler automatically qualify for the final?

It doesn't matter whether Vinesh was in the right or wrong. We are anyways winning the appeal.

With a country with 1/4th the population of the entire planet, and a matter which doesn't have a clear ethical answer, the justice will always favour the majority. If the committee had a clear answer, it wouldn't have accepted the appeal in the first place, or would have given a decision by now.

It is too late now to rule against a billion people who have already made a decision in their minds. A silver would probably be a good trade against outrage of a major chunk of the population.

1. Straight to the point. What if the roles are reversed and we found out that the Japanese wrestler was overweight on day 2 by 50 grams, after securing into finals beating Vinesh while maintaining her record, Do we think the same for her.

We(The Indians ) would have bashed her, trolled her country, run the same long comment sections how the 50 grams should be considered as overweight and sack her from the tournament. 

If IOC says that the silver medal will not be awarded (just like it's now) to anyone other than gold and bronze, Indians would have shown their true colour criticising and shaming Japanese athelete that it's only because of her we will not get any silver(for the matter blaming her for no silver to anyone). 

  
2. Just because we have to defend, doesn't mean we have to defend our people at everytime. Think a little better, Would we be giving excuses if Vinesh was lost to someone who will be caught later to be overweight by 50 grams and strips the chance of a silver medal not to be given to anyone.

They decided to retest in 2023 to be sure. Once that test came back they DQd both fighters and notified the IOC of the situation.

lgdbu8c,t3_1ejfb54,"A well written piece IMO that describes all the various possible aspects of this controversy, and more importantly, the lunacy that's allowing this to be a controversy in the first place.

When rules are not clearly established based on scientific rigor, and exceptions are made in the name of inclusion, then people will not only begin to doubt the legitimacy of the sporting body but also the authority of the organizations that provide information pertaining to the issue. 

In other words, more and more people wont trust the IOC to establish a fair game and more and more people wont trust the news sources that are playing mental gymnastics at the Olympic gold medalist level to report in such a way that adheres to their ideological narratives.

What I personally find amusing is that if you polled most countries, or even people globally, a vast majority of respondents would say that women should have a protected category to their own. Whether a person is trans and identifies into the female category, or whether a person has a disorder of sexual development that imparts on them the physiological benefits of being male, both should be excluded. 

We see this time and time again with polling in the US, for instance, where the issue is highly divided on political lines. It's the one issue where lifelong Democrat voters are most likely to deviate from the official Democrat narrative.

Despite all this, the governing bodies are sticking to their ideological guns and telling the rest of the world that their disagreements and concerns are instead bigoted reactions to not properly understanding ""The Science"" (irreparably damaging trust in scientific institutions because they are no less guilty in being able to police the radical few in their camps as well). 

In closing, one commenter at the end of the article raises an interesting point. If there aren't clearly defined methodologies for determining men and women, and the IOC is instead relying solely on passport info provided by the parent countries, then there aren't clearly defined categories. Several countries are allowing trans individuals to formally change the sex on their passports. 

The resulting clown show is what happens when you prioritize not hurting specific ""underprivileged peoples"" feelings over everything else. Social Marxism, identity politics, and progressive denial of fundamental basics of reality ala Post-Modernism, all converging into a situation where an elite cabal tells the rest of the world not to believe their lying eyes.

It's just usually the presence of the Y chromosome (which typically carries the SRY gene) does indicate that one is biologically male.

In his final report, Professor Richard McLaren detailed decades of financial mismanagement and deception, rule breaking in the ring, and inadequate training and education programmes for referees, judges and officials.

>*Any sports in particular that you're looking forward to watching?*

I always watch the wrestling and weightlifting. They're both great sports to watch, especially wrestling. I just wish it was more popular over here.

>*Favourite Olympics memory?*

Back in 2014, I went to watch the wrestling at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and there was a wrestler who really caught my eye and I supported her throughout the games and she managed to go all the way and win the gold medal.

Here name was Erica Wiebe and after the Commonwealth Games, I followed her on social media (back when I used it) and her journey to the Olympics in Rio in 2016.

I watched her matches at Rio that were available to watch (the BBC only chooses one mat to broadcast) and she made it all the way to the final where she won the gold medal.

My heart was in my mouth the whole time during that final and I was so happy for her when she won that I actually almost cried.",-FangMcFrost-,,2,2,2024-07-26 11:52:12

A bit of canoe slalom on Tuesday, Wednesday we'll try and see the women's triathlon in the morning before going to beach volleyball in the Champs de Mars stadium (next to the Eifel Tower) and then Thursday we have tickets to see the hockey, which includes a GB game.

Anyway answering the questions.

* It will be interesting to see how the ceremony is different from being on a river rather than in a stadium. It presents different challenges and opportunities. The bit I would be most interested in is how they're going to do the rings. Making a prediction, I reckon we're in for a good light and/or drone show.
* Other than those I'm seeing live, I love the chaos of the mixed relays. I think triathlon started it, and then athletics did the 4x400m and swimming has the mixed medley relay. I've just seen there's a mixed relay race walk this year, maybe I'm not too excited about that one. One new event is the kayak cross, which is a bit like boardercross in the winter olympics, but in kayaks. It's not on the day that we're going, so it will be a TV watch.
* It's far too easy to say the [2012 opening ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4As0e4de-rI). So I'll try and mention a couple of left field ones. At Sydney 2000 when the unofficial mascot Fatso the Fat Arsed Wombat took over, a particular highlight being [the bombing contest against the other mascots](https://youtu.be/dJZS6DdS9xI?si=eXq7whykF45QGGvu&t=251). Although at a winter olympics, the [Steven Bradbury gold medal](https://youtu.be/WUi4-H6hfw8?si=uTkxWcLUC1nr9jZu).

Cycling is my #1 sport. Olympic Road Race is always chaotic compared to other races because of small teams and no radios - in Tokyo, the Dutch women thought they'd won, only to discover there was another woman up the road that had already won by the time they got there. Track cycling is awesome, even if we're not as dominant as we used to be. In MTB CC, we've got the very talented Evie Richards and reigning champion Tom Pidcock. Apart from cycling, I like to watch some of most sports, stuff I'd never normally watch, and celebrate all the GB athletes.

Not a single rider at upper levels (hell, even lower levels) between the ages of 15 and 100+ years old has gotten to where they are without learning something that we know is not okay. Longing hunters into the ground. Tie downs or draw reins on upper level horse. Too much whip developing piaffe or passage. It's what we learned. But we don't do it anymore because we know better.

This is opinion on my part, but I also think there is a double standard for female athletes and their behavior and male athletes and their behavior. You cannot tell me that riders known for shady practices like Edward Gal/Patrick Kittel/etc haven't had worse offenses over the years that are just kind of accepted as part of the sport.  

This is especially shocking because unlike the aforementioned riders Dujardin does not have a reputation for this type of behavior. 

I also think the timing is suspect. Someone has been sitting on this footage for 4 years, and it is only revealed right before the Olympics?

For transparency‚Äôs sake, I really hope the video is publicly released (or leaked‚Ä¶), so we can all see it for ourselves. 

While of course it‚Äôs not unusual for someone on the ground to tap with a whip when training the piaffe‚Ä¶ the fact that she said it was ‚Äúout of character and doesn‚Äôt reflect how she trains her horses or coach her pupils‚Äù makes me feel like it must‚Äôve been extreme‚Ä¶ or at least obviously over the line. If it wasn‚Äôt, surely she would at least insinuate that in the statement? 

We all know the video will inevitably get out. She must feel like that the wider Dressage world would and/or the general public would be shocked to see it‚Ä¶? 

I do agree with the commenters saying that the timing of giving the FEI a 4 year old video just days before the Olympics does seem a little bit sus. Ideally, you would hand over that video ASAP‚Ä¶ But if it is abuse - it‚Äôs absolutely better late than never. And if more people/clients feel like they are able to come forward, we‚Äôll know if it truly was an ‚Äúout of character‚Äù moment. 

Wild. Charlotte is one of the last pro riders I would‚Äôve ever expected this from. I do applaud her (or her team/federation, whatever) for withdrawing anyways. 


On that note, I do want to reiterate what the top comment said about nuance and learning over time... 

When I was a teenager, I had to ride in the indoor on a rainy day after school. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt realize that a group jumping lesson started just after I finished my warm up. Usually I would wait to ride until they finished or ride in the other arena‚Ä¶ but whatever. Lessons take precedence, so I would just do my best stay out of their way. But they were practicing full courses one at a time that day and our indoor was only a little larger than a 60x20‚Ä¶ so I ended up having to mostly sitting in the corner with the other students or doing a little bit of walk where I could for the duration of the 1hr lesson. 

I had planned to focus on our lateral work that day and the long side (in between a combination) was pretty much the only space I could do that‚Ä¶ So once the lesson was over, I warmed up again and then trained what I had planned for like 20 mins and did my cool down. 

The jumping coach came in, saw that I was still on and YELLED at me that I should never ride for that long and how unfair I was being to my horse. I was really upset - I would never normally be on my horse for so long, but since I had only just warmed up and then stood around/walked a tiny bit for the whole hour‚Ä¶ I thought it would be okay. Maybe I should‚Äôve just adapted to the circumstances that day - gotten off and chalked it up as a ‚Äústretch your legs/hack day.‚Äù But I was teenager‚Ä¶ and kind of obsessed with sticking to the ‚Äútraining plan‚Äù I had come up with. 

The jumping coach told my coach (the barn‚Äôs Dressage trainer) about what I did. My trainer discussed it with me the next day. After explaining what happened, my coach said that I was okay - it wasn‚Äôt mistreatment. But obviously in the perspective of the jumping coach, it was. It was a good lesson for me to learn - there is clearly right and wrong in terms of welfare‚Ä¶ but like most teens who think very in black and white, it can be difficult to comprehend that there‚Äôs a grey area in between. Something that felt totally okay for me to do might be perceived as maltreatment by someone else - and vice versa. There is nuance to these things. 

If I could do it again now‚Ä¶ was that 20 mins of subpar lateral work around jumps worth being on for so long? Probably not, lol.",regalshield,,10,10,2024-07-23 19:03:14

Also, they asked around and were warned against speaking against her. The now 19yr old saw the more recent suspensions and actions taken against similar abuse like what allegedly occurred in the video and decided to step forward.

I don't know if it's cruel or effective.  I do know that I seldom strike my horse with a whip or use a spur to get my horse to move forward.  I don't even use a flashband on my horse.

There‚Äôs absolutely no excuse for this and there‚Äôs nothing else that should be investigated here. They absolutely made the right decision. It makes me wonder how she‚Äôs treated her past horses. It doesn‚Äôt seem to me like she is lashing out in a brief moment of bad judgment. She clearly is just going through the same action over and over again in the video, as if she‚Äôs done it before.

lh25mix,t3_1elgn9b,"I've been following this issue since it's all over my news feed on Facebook. I truly believe that the only reason why his Mom is PUBLICLY apologizing is because Carlo won. Can you imagine what she would've done if he lost and didn't bring home medals? I bet the mother would've blasted him on socmed and blame all of it on the girlfriend as well. It literally was only a few days ago when she was posting nasty things on Facebook, disowning her son, and literally said that she do not want to support him for being ""disrespectful"". I guess the older toxic generation still has this mindset that when a younger person sets boundaries, they are being disrespectful. No, we are just done being doormats. Respect is earned, not given. I cannot see any ounce of sincerity from that evil mother. Like, really? Holding a fucking presscon just to say ""sorry""? Why can't you do that in private if you really mean it? She just wants to save face, and probably don't wanna miss out on Carlo's earnings. üôÑ 

 The amount of people saying ""she's still your mother so you have to forgive"" are insane. These people may have not been on the receiving end of toxicity and abuse. I am so happy that Carlo at least have a support network outside of his family. Though people say that his girlfriend is ""palengkera"" and disrespectful, I very much commend her for defending her man. I know I would do the same in her situation. I've been raised by great parents, luckily. But I wouldn't tolerate this same shit if they did it to me. Us younger generation need to stop this cycle of ""family is family"" bs.

lgldz2b,t3_1ekbd4n,"just bit of trivia as an aside it's actually possible for a legit biological woman to have an XY chromosome set.  it's extremely rare, and thus not well understood.  while the X chromosome on its own contains the necessary information to build a viable human female, the Y chromosome alone does not do the same and make a male from scratch, (a Y0 or YY zygote will not turn into an embryo), what it seems to do is to modify a female into becoming male this is why a like a clit looks like a tiny cockhead and there is actually a shaft behind it like a penis embedded under the pubic mound, this structure starts forming before it ""decides"" to be a boy or a girl.  and it would seem that this process can fail to activate, but it's not understood why or how, mostly because it's so rare. 

it's one of the rare ways that you can get set of male/female identical twins, and that's how it was discovered, just curiously gene testing a set of strikingly similar presumably fraternal twins. and it's the only known way that they're actually genetically identical.  

it is just trivia though, it's extremely rare. and such an XY female wouldn't be ""mannish"" or like a transwoman, the secondary sex characteristics would be just as inactivated as the primary sex characteristics.  if the girl had a prominent jawline, it'd be like meryl streep's not like ron perlman's.  so if an XY girl did become an athlete, it wouldn't help her in any way she'd be just as likely as any random highschool girl making it to the olympics.",Novogobo,,9,9,2024-08-05 11:49:58

So essentially fuck what the passport says and ignore what her family said she was born a girl and raised like one.

Apparently sex is determined by how you look and not Genitals how you were born with? I mean that is one of the arguments of the transgender right but I doubt that this how the alt right is seeing.

I would push back on this slightly if only because there has been many stories floating around about how they 'rewrote' Gomez's character to be American living in Mexico, to deal with the language hurdle, instead of her being from Mexico originally (like the parallel character in the novel *Ecoute* that Emilia Perez is loosely based on), which says to me they were prioritizing celebrity name over acting ability.

As for the rest, being a non-Spanish speaker myself, I'll link to[ this comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/1iofq6f/comment/mck221l/)from u/FocaSateluca which I think does a great job at summing up the overall failings of casting someone who had to learn the language in six months over an actress who could fluently speak the language, even with adjusting her character's background so she wasn't supposed to be a native Spanish speaker.",theagonyaunt,,142,142,2025-03-30 19:56:19

As a Spanish speaker, I can tell you that we didn't need Audiard to express his contempt and dismissal of our language when he made an entire movie about it. It's incredible how dismissive he was to an entire continent and it's culture. Not only Mexicans felt offended. We felt offended because this is very much normal coming from certain corners of Europe: the sepia-toned, poverty-striken savages. We are so much more than that. 

Also, a fun fact is that he has lost the best foreign film Oscar twice to a LATAM movie (the first time to *El Secreto de sus ojos* and now to *Ainda estou Aqui*) so his contempt might be slightly justified.",wolfierolf,,77,77,2025-03-30 22:07:26

mkmbppt,t3_1jnj4sk,"This is a pretty good recap, but I do want to add the perspective of someone following its awards chances at r/oscarrace, because it was one crazy ride. After winning awards at film festivals where pretty much everyone loved it, it seemed like it had a great chance not just at getting nominated, but winning Best Picture. There started to be a gradual trickle of backlash articles, but not enough that it was clearly something to take seriously. Then it finally released on Netflix and the controversy blew up as the audience scores dropped like a rock. The Letterboxd rating was a 3.8 after the festivals (this is a pretty great score) and had soon plummeted an entire point. A lot of people were totally unsure whether to take it off their predictions entirely or leave it in.

At precursor awards, it got nomination after nomination even as the internet screamed about it. The industry obviously loved it despite the backlash. There was a hilarious clip of one actor (don‚Äôt remember who) being genuinely shocked in an interview when he was told the internet hated his favorite move of the year.

And then at the Golden Globes, the first precursor ceremony of the season, it won Best Musical or Comedy over Anora, which most people had predicted to win. It was briefly the Best Picture frontrunner‚Ä¶and then the Gascon tweets came out. r/oscarrace basically exploded and focused on nothing else for a few days. And by the time the ashes cleared, Emilia P√©rez won nothing else all season except Best Supporting Actress, Best Original Song, and Best International Film awards, with Anora going on to take Best Picture and I‚Äôm Still Here even winning International Film in an upset at the Oscars.

Did the Gascon tweets kill it? There‚Äôs no way to know for sure, a couple of its precursor losses had been voted on before the tweets were widely known. Maybe it was always too divisive to win big awards. But that was how it felt watching its chances plummet from such high heights, and it was one of the most entertaining things I‚Äôve seen in my five years of following the Oscar race.

EDIT: Oh, and this post didn‚Äôt even include another part of the story. I‚Äôm Still Here had a lot of incredibly passionate patriotic Brazilian fans, and its lead actress Fernanda Torres was also nominated for Best Actress. The Torres stans went after Gascon more than anyone else once the tweets came out, and Gascon started implying in interviews that this was some sort of coordinated attack from Torres and her campaign. This is arguably against Academy rules about campaigning (no criticism of fellow nominees is allowed), and some were talking about whether Gascon would get her nomination rescinded. It never happened, but the Brazilians did get their revenge by winning International Film in an upset.",Idk_Very_Much,,50,50,2025-03-31 02:00:27

li2aau1,t3_1erxkbv,"Setting aside the misogynistic portion for the moment let‚Äôs talk about whether the hate, regardless of motivation, is justified or reasonable. 

First of all, my stance is that it‚Äôs shitty no matter how you slice it.  I watched all of the women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs breaking and qualifying.  Did I think her performances had silly moments? Yes.  Did I feel bad for her that the judges gave all their votes to her opponents? No, that was the correct judging decision. 

However, the level of vitriol and disingenuous posturing about how she ‚Äúmade a mockery of the sport and/or the Olympics‚Äù is just not founded in reality.  Here‚Äôs some key points I‚Äôve seen and my refutation:

> the Olympics are about the best of the best. How could there be such a big skill gap between her and the other performers? 

Achieving parity in sport competition is neigh impossible even on the national level let alone the global level.  There will always be skill gaps caused by the popularity of and access to the sport in different regions of the world. 

Compare the Pistons last NBA season to the Celtics.  They might as well have been in two different leagues.  ‚ÄúOkay, so that‚Äôs just taking the worst in the league [of the best players in the country/world] and comparing it to the best‚Äù. Fair, so let‚Äôs look at the history of men‚Äôs basketball in the Olympics.  There was quite a long period of time where the US taking the gold was a forgone conclusion and watching them play other teams was like watching the Harlem globetrotters play a middle school team.  No one was asking of the other men‚Äôs team ‚Äúhow could they possibly be there? How is the skill gap so big?‚Äù  Over time as the sport became more popular globally and access to more opportunities, better facilities, better coaching, etc lead to it being a much more competitive sport (I mean the us men‚Äôs team this year was disgusting with historic basketball talent and still barely took the gold from France) 

Breaking is in the Olympics for the first time and its competitive format that was used was only recently developed.   The places where breaking is the most popular (Japan, China, the Netherlands) all had some of the best results in both men and woman‚Äôs.  There were MULTIPLE other dancers who lost matches without getting a single vote. 

(NOTE: regarding votes. I see a lot of people saying ‚Äúshe got 0 points!‚Äù As though it was like a diving or gymnastic scoring system where judges assign numerical values to individual moves.  The scoring system was not based on ‚Äúpoints‚Äù but was comparative based on votes. They vote for who they think won the round.  So getting zero votes does not mean the judges think what you did had no value or took no skill. It just means they believe you competitor did better.  As I mentioned, this happened to multiple other competitors and NO ONE is mentioning them or giving them shit about it. Just like no one is giving anyone who came last in a track race or swim meet shit just because everyone else did better than them) 

> She damaged the reputation and image of the sport and the people who ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù to be there

Did she though? In my experience, the people who are making this claim are not themselves breakers, did not watch or follow it before, and do not seem to be actually interested in the rest of the competition.  I haven‚Äôt seen a single person making this argument mention a single other competitor by name. 

Like I mentioned above, I watched all of the breakdancing.  It was absolutely sick.  Both the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs medalists were incredible and I enjoyed watching the whole experience (even Raygun‚Äôs qualifiers).   Was seeing Raygun do her silly Kangaroo move enough to put you off of the sport? Did you even watch the rest of the competition to support the other competitors that she supposedly disrespected?  Have you done anything to further the sport or image of breaking? If not, it‚Äôs hard for me to take your posturing about the sanctity of the sport seriously because all indications would show you don‚Äôt actually care about it in the first place. You just care about making this woman feel bad. 

She is obviously passionate about the sport/artform. She has been active in her country in creating spaces where it is practiced and competitions happen.  She‚Äôs actively been an ambassador of it.  She might not be the best, but there could be a young person picking up breaking in Australia who might be and would never have known about it or had opportunities to compete in their country without her.  

So ask yourself, as someone who has done literally nothing to spread or support the sport (I am assuming this due to you not saying so when it would be incredibly relevant info) feel you have the authority to declare how much her silly dance harmed and respected the sport?  Because to me it seems like you care a lot more about justifying disparaging this poor woman than you do about the integrity of the sport she very clearly cares about.  

As far as the misogynistic argument,  I have a suspicion a lot of people will make the claim that ‚Äúif a man had done the same performance, I would react in the same way!‚Äù And unfortunately without the ability to explore alternate timelines there‚Äôs no way of rejecting that hypothesis.  However, in my opinion it does seem like one of the many cases where women get put under more scrutiny and held to a higher standard than men.   There were a couple of breakers in the men‚Äôs section that clearly were not on the level of the rest of the field and did some silly/unconventional looking moves.  No one is talking about that.  

At the end of the day, a woman who qualified for the Olympics, went and performed at a sport that she is passionate about,  looked silly, and has invited news networks, online commenters, stand up comedians, etc.  all to pile on to the meme of the moment to get a laugh at her expense while pretending they actually give a shit about the sport and don‚Äôt just revel in the opportunity to me mean for no good reason.",Gullible_Elephant_38,,15,15,2024-08-14 12:27:09

If you are finding yourself very passionate about this issue when you had very little interest in it before, it suggests that you are really just hating without much of a basis. To me that would make one a keyboard warrior. 

She had a poor performance in a new Olympic sport. It‚Äôs really not a big problem but she is getting hate from all over the internet. Why? I don‚Äôt know, but it isn‚Äôt really fair on her.

li2qw0w,t3_1erxkbv,">CMV: Raygun hate is not misogynistic

>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnS7TpvMRpI

The linked source is a great example of what you're asking for. It's not a clean video of Meares' comments, it's playing over looped clips of the competition in a way that's pretty clearly meant to demonstrate that Raygun deserves the hate. But why is it comparing her performance to a guy's? And specifically, why is the part of the guy's performance being compared a *power move*?

You may not read the misogyny in this, but it's there in two ways. First, it's not like there weren't plenty of clips from the b-girl competition that could have demonstrated the same point, but **for some reason** the person putting the video together thought it was best demonstrated by a guy. Which leads into the second: b-boys , for physiological reasons, have an easier time with flashy power moves than b-girls, so when the video is saying ""Raygun sucks at breaking because her performance didn't look like a b-boy's power move"" it's specifically calling out a gendered difference in the scene in a way that implies women aren't as good at breaking in general.

To be fair, most people making that comparison of Raygun probably aren't thinking of, or necessarily aware of, the gendered differences in the scene. That doesn't mean it's not there, it doesn't mean it doesn't have any misogynistic roots, and it doesn't mean misogyny isn't playing into their assessment of Raygun's performance or the way and confidence with which they're criticising her, a consistently high-performing veteran of the Australian competitive scene and Olympic qualifier. As suggestive of this, consider that there are no criticisms of Raygun's selection or score that wouldn't also apply to J-Attack, but no-one's saying *he* shouldn't have turned up at all, that he disrespected breaking or that he was only selected because his mum was a judge.

li2w40o,t3_1erxkbv,"I think what has happened is Raygun has ended up between two extremes.

One the one hand, if anyone of us had somehow found ourselves there we would have been much worse than Raygun. But we'd have given it the good ol college try. We'd have been terrible, but we would have tried to recreate the patterns and styles of others, and tried to flow with the music, to the best of our non-abilities. 

We probably wouldn't have done the sprinkler, or done shapes that appeared to be mocking of the event. 

That's where the other hand comes in though: We'd have done what we did because we know nothing. Raygun doesn't know nothing, she knows a lot. She certainly knows that she - nor any Australian currently - can compete at breaking on a world level when it comes to power, style and strength. But she is informed enough to know that creativity and innovation have a major part to play in breaking. And so she leaned into that and used popular imagery that people will have been associating with the Olympics and with Australia to make something that was recognisable and fun. 

Unfortunately that 'popular imagery...recognisable and fun' read much more as her mocking the event than it read as her legitimately trying to break seriously and treat it as a competition. And even more unfortunately she was unable to convincingly look like she was competent enough to be making informed choices. Even though she probably is if she were to have done her standard routine.

I think right now as much of the performative hatred of Raygun is rooted in anti-Academia and feigned ""anti-elitism"" as it is misogyny. It is being used as a bludgeon against universities, social sciences and the worth of studying things. She hits a button that makes her an equally easy target for both the left trying to score easy points (appropriating culture and elitism by hegemonic power of her contacts) and the right (""proving the uselessness"" of liberal arts, being ""anti-excellence"", and elitism by using the socialist power of universities).

The only people the left and right would agree are easy to bag on are middle class, white millennial women who works in a public institution focusing on the liberal arts and studying a minority cultural element. It's like a Full House.

li2wr2x,t3_1erxkbv,"Just on this one point.

>Does lack of female representation cause lack of female participation?

Yes but not always. Any situation where there is a lack of representation will cause members (not all) of the underrepresented group to feel deterred from being involved. Either because they feel they ""can't"" or it's ""not for them"" etc. Again, not for all or even necessarily the majority, but what we see will always influence what we feel is accessible.

It is not unreasonable to say that unfair criticism that leads to a reduction of representation can and does influence a lack of future participation. If you don't see people like you doing something, and the few that are seem to get an unfair treatment, it doesn't really inspire and likely deters you. It frames whatever ""it"" is as a hostile and/or potentially unsafe environment/activity/etc to be a part of and it's pretty reasonable to therefore not want to participate/be discouraged from doing so.",kwamzilla,,1,1,2024-08-14 14:41:40

Watching Raygun dance, honestly if you were to give me a day to practice, I could probably pull off something similar.
There was nothing in there that really required a lot of dexterity, flexibility, or coordination, and even as a person who is not particularly physically active I didn't see anything that was remotely impressive.

On a broader scale, if what you‚Äôre looking for is someone to try and show that all criticism of Raygun is misogynistic, that‚Äôs simply impossible. There are certainly legitimate criticisms, and people can criticize Raygun without being misogynistic.

li71xpj,t3_1erxkbv,"I'll be honest, Raygun's performance was *not good* but I do want to push you to challenge your thinking. There's a part of your argument that you should investigate.

Specifically, when you're talking about female atheletes facing criticism.

There's a lot of contributing factors as to why women, particularly in physical athletic competitions, under perform when compared to men. This should be broadly eliminated in a digital competition. 

You might argue that men still have an advantage because of reaction speed but...While some studies suggest men have a faster reaction speed, other studies have found the opposite. On the whole, it seems there isn't a general difference based on sex.

So then, investigate why women may not be as good on average as men in eSports. 

Primarily, I'd point to culture.

Video games are often gendered for boys, reducing the number of girls that play them.

Video games that have competitive elements are often almost exclusively gendered toward a male audience

Video game communities are often insular and creepy. Imagine being a woman and seeing gamers lose their mind over Lara Croft's ""man face."" Icons within the gaming sphere promote a misogynistic ideology as well, with huge figures like Ninja refusing to play with girls. 

Imagine trying to get good at a game, but if your team mate finds out you're a girl, they're going to harass you and throw and there's so much content of that you can make a [33 episode video series.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEDsO12Ccv9ES1Qlnwu_Gi72udJyhVXyZ&si=7WmPx7mrx6YgvSrz)

Women don't just face criticism when they choose to pursue these careers. Its framed that way to keep it polite. Its harassment.

Almost every major, successful female athelete you know has been accused of being a man. Serena Williams. Katie Ledecky. Britney Griner.

You can argue that men face harassment, too. I'll say its not to the same degree.

I'd also ask if you think that harassment even should be there in the first place.

Male dominated industries sound like they're horrible places to be in for women? Well, you havent seen how they treat men in them. Ever heard of railroad work culture? Failures and poor performers get treated like absolute horrible shit. Hell, even the good workers get treated like shit, so long as you're new. And you're supposed to man up and take all of that in stride to fit into the group and be treated like one of them. I mean, think about it. I'm gonna cite one very blatant example that's been around all throughout human history: war. Traditionally, men are the ones that are conscripted for armies to be sent off to wars. And throughout history, the training regimen that recruits go through are extremely brutal and difficult, which were only relaxed recently when women started joining the armed forces in the name of diversity. So what does that tell me? For tens of thousands of years going back to the dawn of human civilization, from the age of Gilgamesh, its okay to abuse men to turn them into warriors only to send them off to die, but 20 years of women trying to get into the armed forces and we need to relax standards because women wouldnt be able to get into the armed forces otherwise? And this is just armed forces in peacetime. We havent seen what happens if WW3 starts and people actually get sent to die in Normandy style meat grinders again. 

  
Also. Man, why'd you gotta bring up Vaevictus? That whole mess was a goddamn disgrace. It really reminded me of the old days of Dota played on WC3, where the winning team could drag a match out for literal hours if the opposing team was too weak or unskilled to play. It wasnt just that the all female team was bad at the game, but also that their opponents were dragging out the game to the point that it became unbearable to watch. Now I'm not gonna claim any motive here, because being in the esports for almost two decades by now I can see two reasons why they did it: first one is they wanted to drag it out and torment the female players, and second one is they didint want to finish the game too quickly and give the female players a chance to farm up and fight them on equal grounds, because ultimately the game has a hard cap on how far you can upgrade your characters, so theoretically if the losing team can hold out long enough, they would gear up to the same level as the winning team and it will all come down to rock scissors paper matchups to beat them. Some heroes in these games after all, are hard carries which are designed to be extremely difficult to play early game and even mid game, but if they can gear up, they're pretty much unstoppable. Either way this goes, it does not change that those girls were not meant to be playing there, and trying to make way for them only resulted in one of the most (if not the most) humiliating matches in esports ever.",CN8YLW,,1,1,2024-08-15 08:22:44

li9b1xv,t3_1erxkbv,"Some countries have sports that just don‚Äôt have much in the way of infrastructure. One example I think of is of the person from I believe Equiatorial Guinea who won a swimming event heat without actually knowing how to swim. They learned how to float and survive from local fishermen, but when they got to the Olympics, they asked as many coaches for pointers that they could. They performed about as well as you can imagine, yet because their home country lacked the proper infrastructure for teaching people how to swim, they won only because of a false start by their 2 fellow swimmers. 

I think that if I viewed that instance through the lens of Raygun and how people have handled her performance, I would say that that swimmer from EG (Equiatorial Guinea) was disrespecting the sport by coming with a less than mediocre performance. I think the biggest difference between the two circumstances is that this example was specifically for developing countries, but even then, one could say that it‚Äôs disrespectful to send an athlete that is outright incapable of truly competing at an event to the Olympics as people are saying with Raygun. Another big difference to that example I mentioned is that the swimmer from EG was a man and Raygun is a woman. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs untoward to say that that has nothing to do with the widespread criticism she has received. On lie commonly purported about her is that she essentially slept onto the team with her husbands influence giving her the push to Paris. This has been debunked by those in the actual scene of the sport, and the reality is much less exciting than that. She won the competitions‚Äô requirements to actually qualify on paper for the Olympics. Many in the scene are now wanting a skill floor of sorts in place so you have to score enough points to meet a threshold. But it was always a one time Olympic event. Diverting a ton more resources to a sport isn‚Äôt guaranteed just because you‚Äôre considered a developed country. 

I think that League of Legends is an interesting analog, and I think it‚Äôs a good example of how when it comes to gender diversity in either esports or more physical sports, women are going to be defined by the worst talent that has the biggest spotlight on them in industries that offer little in terms of a safe space for people to explore their passions in a meaningful way. Lack of precedent in a given scene has provably been shown to decrease participation in a sport from certain demographics. Basically, it‚Äôs like pointing out how few people of color are in swimming events and then saying that the ones who attempt and do so poorly have the weight of their entire race or gender on their back. Caitlyn Clark has the entire goddamn WNBA on her back atm publicity-wise for example. 

All of that to say about Raygun criticisms:

Did she perform poorly in comparison to the rest of the talent? Yes, absolutely. Even taking the point that some have made of ‚ÄúIf she was just a bit faster, she‚Äôd be considered a good contender,‚Äù into account, the same can be said of a rally driver vs an F1 driver. Speed is crucial in many sports, and if you don‚Äôt have it when you need it, you need to get a lot more creative in learning how to excel well enough to be considered Olympic caliber. 

Is some or perhaps even a non-negligible amount of the hate misogynistic? Probably. We aren‚Äôt so removed from sexism that it‚Äôs not still part of the common worldview and cultural understandings we have to not be at least a little of that. 

Does that mean that you as an individual have sexist or misogynistic mal-intent because you think qualifiers should weed out that caliber of performance? No.

But for either side of this debate to find common ground, the people criticizing her need to admit that perhaps some in their crowd aren‚Äôt doing so with the best of intentions. And the people defending her need to admit that her skill level is not where it should be for someone on the world stage and expect to be taken seriously. 

And people using this as an excuse to share debunked and polemic accusations need to be more careful. Women at this Olympics have been through the fucking ringer like the boxer from Algeria who was falsely accused of being a man in a women‚Äôs event, Raygun who performed poorly, some of Simone Biles‚Äô teammates being called lazy by a former US Olympic gymnast, and I‚Äôm sure many other have only made it out unscathed because they were lucky enough to not be targeted by this mob that goes Cntl Z on women‚Äôs crotches on Tv as if that isn‚Äôt an insane thing to do. 

So comprehensively, you can‚Äôt say that some of the criticism the AOC is talking about isn‚Äôt fueled by misogyny. But maybe not at that angle from you specifically.

If a country's best athlete in a sport qualifies to compete in the Olympics but they come in last or know they'll come in last, should the country just not send anyone?

If the real issue is that the standard of competition allows unacceptably poor performances that are (allegedly) so bad they devalue the sport's brand, why are we mad at the athlete for not being good enough?

If you have experts in a sport decide someone is the best at a sport and you are trying to select someone to compete before experts, who is the better choice? The athlete selected by the experts who watch the full competition, know the sport, and understand the scoring? Or the athlete that social media finds less silly?

It is annoying to exist as a woman, knowing that basically at all times you are seen as a representative of women. Seeing a woman fail and then thinking that this will minimise the achievements of other women is misogynistic. I don't want to represent all women, I don't want all my failures to be representative of my whole gender. That's what minimises women's achievements and what discourages women from even trying.

If ballet were an Olympic sport, would you allow someone to get out there without pointe shoes or know how to do a basic Pirouette?

Dearest Gentle Reader, 

I‚Äôm about to step on some toes in regard to the Opening Ceremony at the Paris Olympics. 

The headless woman was Marie Antoinette. She ruled over France and was found guilty of treason, conspiracy, and stealing from the country. 

Sound familiar?

Also, it was not the Last Supper. It was a depiction of an ancient Greek Bacchanal‚Ä¶ because, you know, the Olympics are ancient and Greek. Surprise!

And if you didn‚Äôt know, a Bacchanalia is an uncontrollably promiscuous, extravagant, and loud party. The parties often spanned several days which honored the god of wine, Bacchus (the blue guy covered in grape vine). He is also known as Dionysus, the Greek god of fertility, later known as the god of wine and pleasure.

And finally, it was not Death on a pale horse. It was Sequana, Goddess of the Seine, the River in which the boat precession took place. She was meant to be the representation of the Olympic spirit and of Sequana.

If some of you weren‚Äôt so busy trying to end the Dept. of Education, you might know this.

Loosen the clutch on your pearls.

Sure if it comes out that the coach did it, he will face the appropriate consequences like any criminal charges from his/her home country and maybe even getting charged in the country where the spiking occured, but the athlete is responsible for being within the rules of the sport.",ThrowRA_SA123,,1,1,2024-08-12 11:55:09

lg2vws2,t3_1ehxj3a,"I took a course in media studies in university and learned just how biased any media source is. They all have their own agenda. The first headline that I saw almost made it seem like the Italian boxer had refused to fight and made it seem like this was some noble thing... taking a stand. Then the narrative was that they had been hit so hard by a male that they could not continue. And trotted out the fact the International Boxing Association disqualified her for failing the gender testing. First the claim was too much testosterone but articles say that testosterone testing was not done. Then it was that they have XY chromosomes. And they were only disqualified after they beat a Russian athlete. So it could very well have been a case of corruption. And they competed at the last Olympics as a woman. And it wasn't an issue then.

But people are quick to jump on the bandwagon and just post it because that's what they want to believe. And that's what the media is spinning.... because division and hate drives clicks. Seems like people don't want to take the time to do their due diligence and fact check before posting anything. 

One thing that is known is that they are not transgender... despite what people are claiming. There is speculation (I won't say reports because I have already seen how shaky some of the evidence is) that they are DSD (possibly intersex) but that has not been confirmed. Or maybe they are a cis female with terrific knockout power.

It's also interesting because they aren't even #1 ranked... They are like #5. So if they have this supposed advantage over everyone else in the field you would think that they would be #1.

ldb019t,t3_1e3vf7k,"A few things there are not true, but irrelevant given most are. 

As a Brazilian the Brazil concert shitshow is terrible. Mostly US and European fans don't give a shit either, they weren't even paying attention to those concerts. 
But let me tell you, the death of a young fan is the most tragic thing but it's not the only thing that happened.
Brazilian Swifties won't tell the whole story because 1) they want to protect Taylor 2) for good reason because US and Europeans Swifties are xenophobic assholes and they take the whole story as ""a tale on how Brazil is a crap 3rd world fucked up country"" when in reality Rio is a major event city having hosted Olympics and Football World Cup (including the final) and all major artists come here and the events have absolutely no problem.... Except Taylor's.

Here's what happened, and I know because I was there: a major heat wave was hitting Rio that weekend. Ok, that's not Taylor's faulty someone might say.... Except, well Brazil is a country known for big heat waves, originally the Lover tour Brazil dates were July, and that make sense (it's our winter) so she scheduled for late November this time, well so that's a risk someone such a pro like Taylor like to make people believe she is shouldn't take.

The first Rio date, Friday: it was HOT but there were some clouds during the day so it was not that terrible... But fans were in the line since the day before. Rio concert didn't have seats so people wanted to get the close to the stage. There was no support from the Concert (neither the firm promoting it, the stadium administration or Taylor's team) for them. No organization, no food, no water. Just the people that live around the stadium to sell stuff and some to help a bit. Most of them didn't have a lot of money, many got debts just to be there. Brazil is a poor country and many of those fans couldn't buy food or water for the prices that the informal people were charging (A LOT). That was the day the girl died. I was there. When I got into the stadium I knew I wasn't going to be near the stage so I was a bit behind, for me the concert was fine because it seemed empty because EVERYONE in the premium area was glued to stage fences. They couldn't move, it was terrible. The girl died, Taylor stoped the show many times to request water for people COLLAPSING, it was not just Ana, there were MORE THAN 1000 people that requested medical assistance that day. More than 500 fainted. That concert shouldn't have happened. Not with fans dehydrated and without food and crowding in the fences. All that I saw because I was there.
Another thing that I don't have proof, so believe if you want, but multiple people said it happened: the medical staff were giving Clonazepam to the girls saying it was anxiety and not dehydration. That made things a lot worse to the girls. 

Day 2, Saturday, cancelled: the heat was WORSE than Friday because there were no clouds all day. I had tickets but I simply give up around noon. I told my girlfriend ""we're not going, we are going to die there."", so I never left my house. That show was obviously cancelled but NOT BEFORE everyone was already inside the stadium and got though the 12h line again. The metal fences and barriers were so hot a lot of people got severe burns. The chaos around the stadium was intense, there were a lot of problems with rumors of people dying, roberry and gunshots that didn't happened, most of the fans were not from Rio and were scared and hysterical. Many had transfers from hotels set with vans and buses private services and nobody knew how to contact them. It was chaos. Well the stadium DON'T HAVE PHONE AND INTERNET CONNECTION DURING THE EVENTS. That's how crap that Stadium is. 

So who was responsible for all that? Legally, I don't know. Nothing happened as far as I know. But morally? First Taylor shouldn't have chosen a crap Organization firm for the event, just crap, terrible. Second, Engenhao is not Rio's best stadium, there are a lot of concerts there like Coldplay and others but most are not like Taylor's with a lot of foreigner fans and people camping in lines for days. She should have chosen Maracan√£, the World Cup Final stadium. Paul McCartney pick that one. He's not getting the cheap one, but the best one. Why didn't she choose Maracan√£? Maybe because it's more expensive maybe it was not available because of football matches, so in the end she didn't plan the best dates for Brazil's concerts risking heat waves and getting the crap stadium. 

This is the first time I'm writing all this. This sub is the only place I can do it. I like Taylor and I don't agree with everything is written here. I think this sub loses perspective too easily, focus in irrelevant or false stuff and not paying attention to the real important things. But anyway.

- Speaking of Scott, the whole drama with Taylor not being able to own her masters was a moot point because not only did she profit from the masters, her dad did as well because he had ownership rights in them.
- She didn‚Äôt just block Sabrina Carpenter from getting a top chart spot, she‚Äôs done that to so many female artists, most recently Charli XCX by releasing region- and time- locked versions of TTPD to drown out Charli‚Äôs new album ‚Äòbrat‚Äô, which was projected to be #1 in the UK.

   * forcing fans to buy multiple variants in order to get all tracks - no single variant includes everything
   * promotes them as ""limited edition"" or ""only available for next ***X*** hours"" to incentivise swifties to rush to buy them, only for more to be available later
   * promotes them with phrasing such as ""collect them all"" (sure collectors can collect if they so desire, but if you build up your fanbase to believe they will be ""rewarded"" for buying multiple copies then this is shady)
* intentionally releases variants in an attempt to block other artists from reaching #1 in the charts (Billie Eilish, Charlie XCX, etc)

There is this one now too. I presume ""significant policy modifications"" quoted on their homepage were was required by the Trump Administration specifically with the goal of shuttering the [Center for Human Identification](https://www.untchi.org/) without having to actually come out and say we are pulling the plug.

From their homepage
""Due to funding limitations and significant program modifications directed by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), beginning January 1, 2021, the UNT Center for Human Identification (UNTCHI) management and operation of the National Missing and Unidentified Person System (NamUs) will cease. UNTCHI will no longer be able to support NamUs stakeholders with any analytical or case support; victim services; system development; or new forensic services. The forensic services include: DNA typing (currently suspended), fingerprint examination, forensic odontology, and forensic anthropology (currently suspended). Effective immediately, NamUs will also be unable to support states that have passed legislation mandating the use of NamUs, including bulk data import needs.
UNTCHI at the University of North Texas Health Science Center has been proud to manage NamUs through a cooperative agreement with NIJ since October 1, 2011. However, despite our best efforts over the past several months to reach a sustainable solution, the sweeping program changes being mandated by NIJ at this time make it untenable for UNTCHI to continue management of NamUs.

We deeply regret the negative impact this situation will have on the thousands of NamUs criminal justice and public customers and stakeholders across the country. NamUs is the only program of its kind in existence, and we hope the program can continue its important work for agencies and families nationwide.

We will provide more information as it becomes available.""",notswasson,,3,3,2020-12-04 02:32:14

And it is rather odd, because as a general rule, our vacation time is meager when compared to what workers in most European countries receive. 

Many Americans consider themselves lucky if their jobs allow them three weeks of vacation per year. To spend several precious days of that time just traveling seems absolutely bonkers.

Driving allows you a measure of freedom that train travel can't. If you see something interesting from your window, you can simply pull over to get a better look as opposed to zooming right past it.

I spent a week in Scotland on holiday, and she was really underestimating how vast Scotland is. When I was there last year, I rented a car in Inverness and drove around to Culloden and Urquhart Castle, but I wouldn't drive in Edinburgh or Glasgow. No needs as they have good public transportation and are walkable. This year, I stayed in Edinburgh and traveled out from there. Did a day trip to Glasgow and it was easy and quick. Did go up to Fort William and spent a night, and that was a long train ride.

As an American, I love trains. I love the scenery and being able to read or sleep while travelling. I flew into London then took a train to Edinburgh. My day trips out of Edinburgh were on trains. Train to Fort William. Then overnight sleeper train from Fort William to London. Train from London to Oxford and back. When I went over to the continent, I took the Nightjet sleeper train from Vienna to Amsterdam, then the Eurostar to Brussels, then again from Brussels back to London. It was so much more convenient than flying and going through airports.

I laid it all out for her - 6 cities around Great Britain in a little under a month, how/why we chose the cities, how we got around, what we loved, what we'd do differently, but stressed that over all, we'd had a really excellent trip, warts and all. (The less said about South Western Rail, the better!)

Her response was generally the same.  That she loved the Americans that planned so thoroughly because we usually asked good questions, left ourselves plenty of time to get from Point A to Point B, rolled with the punches and just figured out how to move forward, and if we had extra time, we'd fill it one way or the other. ü§£",Chasmosaur,,9,9,2024-03-24 04:33:08

I left every morning at daybreak to watch the sunrise over the ocean. I think the only people I had any real conversation with were the other people on the beach. Afterwards, I did whatever occured to me. 

Took the train for day trips. Did the same hop on/hop off bus tour in London and spent most of the day in museums. (I adore museums.)

The two things that were surprising for me were the food and the shopping. I expected food that was at least sorta familiar, but it was just weird. Like, I went into a sandwich shop and ordered a ham and cheese sandwich, right off the menu. The clerk looked at me like I had two heads. ""You want *cheese* on your sandwich??"" When she brought it to me, I had a single slice of luncheon meat between two slices of dry bread with **grated** cheese sprinkled inside.

Ideology means nothing in the face of reality. If you put an individual with a male karyotype who has been through male puberty and has testosterone in the normal male range in a combat sport to compete against a woman, you are putting that woman at risk.

The IOC let them down by 1/ stopping sex-testing 2/ transferring the responsibility to the official governing federation for each sport 3/ cancelling the rules previously held by the IBA.

Individual athletes have no responsibility in the outcome of this policy once they've been officially allowed to compete.

It‚Äôs how it is in animal world therefore I applied it to humans too. The condition of being intersex was always confusing to me because I wasn‚Äôt sure if people with XY chromosomes are able to produce eggs and able to give birth generally. It seems to be the case that in majority of cases they don‚Äôt have a uterus developed for it even if being born with a vagina. But again it‚Äôs a very uncovered area as it seems to me and I wish more studies would‚Äôve been done in this area to make it clear, in the world where sex became so blurry and doesn‚Äôt matter to many, we surely need clarity and as a sex that‚Äôs been oppressed throughout history based solely on our biological difference and ‚Äúweaknesses‚Äù to males, women surely deserve this clarity and protection from further being taken advantage of based on our biological difference.",Cubone101,,36,36,2024-08-11 06:30:53

m3q2u7w,t3_1ep6ydk,"Thank you so much for this post. The inclusion of athletes who have undergone male puberty or who have biological characteristics with male-level physical advantages (e.g., XY chromosomes) in women‚Äôs sports fundamentally undermines the purpose of a sex-based category in competition. Women‚Äôs sports exist specifically to counteract the biological disadvantages that female athletes face compared to male athletes. Allowing individuals with male-level advantages to compete in these categories, regardless of identity or hormonal interventions, creates a playing field that is not level and disadvantages the athletes these categories were designed to protect.

Hormone suppression, while mitigating some aspects of male physiology, does not reverse the structural and muscular advantages gained from male puberty. Even with testosterone suppression, advantages in bone density, muscle mass, and oxygen-carrying capacity still remain significant. These are not superficial differences; they translate directly to measurable advantages in speed, strength, and endurance, particularly in physically demanding or contact sports.

The argument for inclusion often frames the issue as one of fairness and representation for trans and intersex athletes (which I will touch on in due course), but fairness should not come at the expense of excluding or disadvantaging women. When women are forced to compete against athletes with male physical advantages it devalues the integrity of women‚Äôs sports and discourages participation. This is especially egregious in combat sports, where disparities in strength are a direct threat safety.

The handling of these cases by governing bodies like the IOC has been inconsistent and overly politicised. The reluctance to clearly define and enforce boundaries (no doubt out of fear of backlash or accusations of discrimination) has resulted in rules that are vague, unfair, and unsustainable. Science and biology are being disregarded in favor of ideological narratives, which harms the credibility of sports and leaves female athletes in an impossible position.

If fairness and safety are truly the priorities, eligibility for women‚Äôs sports should be determined by biological sex, not gender identity or hormonal levels. This doesn‚Äôt mean they shouldn‚Äôt find alternative solutions, such as open or mixed categories, for athletes who don‚Äôt fit neatly into classifications. But the current approach sacrifices the rights and opportunities of one group (women) for the sake of inclusion, and that is neither fair nor justifiable.

The inclusion of intersex people in arguments about transgender participation in sports is so often manipulative and disingenuous. Intersex people have distinct biological and realities that are completely separate from the self-identification debates surrounding transgender athletes and conflating the two blurs important boundaries.

Intersex people are frequently reduced to convenient examples used to deflect or obscure valid concerns about fairness in women‚Äôs sports. We‚Äôve all seen people bring up intersex conditions as a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù to suggest that biological sex is inherently ambiguous or irrelevant. This tactic is intellectually dishonest because while intersex variations do exist, they represent extremely rare exceptions that do not invalidate the reality of the male/female sex binary as it applies to 99.98% of the population.

It also overshadows the genuine medical and social issues they face. Intersex conditions are not a political talking point; they are real, often medically complex, and deserve to be addressed respectfully and separately from the ideological battles surrounding transgender rights or women‚Äôs sports. Not used as a red herring designed to distract from difficult truths about physical advantage. It ultimately harms both intersex individuals and the integrity of the discussion. These are different issues that should be treated as such.",goddamitletmesleep,,7,7,2024-12-25 11:42:52

You're not dealing with the fairness aspect at all in this post, which is kinda important when claiming to have ""the final answer"". Your own quote highlights that the setters were shocked by her poor dyno abilities, a skill that is very trainable (demonstrated  perfectly by Brooke Raboutou, who used to struggle *a lot* on dynos).

We wouldn't be having this discussion of the move was instead a really burly power move or a heinous crimpy campus section. Here people recognize that its trainable and dont blame it on height, build, hand size, etc., even though there absolutely is an advantage in being shorter when it comes to raw finger strength.

ltt19cx,t3_1gc00m2,"As I interpret this it doesn't matter how skilled the competitors were in any respect, they actually failed to set the start to the requested standards. 

Ai is obviously bad at jumping from the mats and this had been a problem multiple times before, they absolutely should have known - but more importantly reconsidered the start - the starting holds were both far apart and high up - both of which demand a higher jump or reward a taller climber, and difficulty in jumping off the mats increases rapidly as height decreases - the common 'Raboutou is one inch taller' response just bugs me - one inch is actually a lot in this sort of scenario, but also what's the difference from toes to outstretched hands (the measurement that would actually matter) and more importantly who were the only 2 competitors who didn't get the start first try? Being shorter obviously disadvantaged Raboutou as well, and yes she could compensate with more power, but the start obviously wasn't expected or supposed to be difficult and to me that obviously means the setters screwed up.

Comp bouldering is more and more about dynamic movements and less and less suited to climbers like Ai, and it's going that way because people like to see dynamic moves - which although it isn't my thing is fine - but people also don't like seeing someone struggle on the mats for 4 minutes. I don't care that real boulders sometimes have starts like that, nothing about comp bouldering is realistic any more, so if Ai was going to struggle, and she was regardless of the start, just let the start be lower and let her struggle on the wall, not off it. It wouldn't change the integrity of the comp at all, but it would have made the event so much better to watch.",VariousHorses,,12,12,2024-10-26 05:13:37

ltpu8ms,t3_1gc00m2,"Backup of the post's body: In the Paris 2024 olympics bouldering competition, a controversy arose when competitor Ai Mori, known for her short height and below average jumping skills, failed to even reach the starting holds of boulder number 1 of the final round. The internet split into two camps: people claiming Ai should just be better at jumping, and people claiming route setters should do a better job at setting for all competitors.

But now, thanks to a recently released [interview with Pierre Broyer](https://www.grimper.com/news-interview-froid-pierre-broyer-ouvreur-jo-temoigne), one of the eight setters, we finally have an official answer.

Here's the relevant excerpt from the interview (translated):

> **Can we talk about Ai Mori's boulder ? Is this important ?**
>
> According to [the IFSC's] guidelines, every climber was excepted to reach the first zone. Therefore the start was not supposed to be restrictive. In that regard, we made a mistake.
> [...] We never imagined that the start would be an issue for her. Ai Mori excels in certain styles, but is also lacking in others, which we underestimated.

So there it is, there you have it:
- The setters were explicitly asked by the IFSC to set boulders where *every* climber should be able to reach the first zone
- The setters knew Ai Mori's weaknesses, but underestimated them when setting that specific boulder
- Therefore, and from their own words: the mistake was theirs.

ltwebji,t3_1gc00m2,"It seems kinda silly to blame setters for bot being able to start a boulder, no? If I walk up to the hardest boulder at a comp and fail to start it, does that mean the setting is bad, or does that mean I'm just not strong/coordinated/flexible enough? I hate dynamic moves, so I have no interest in training them. But you won't find me complaining that a set is bad because I can't do a move that I consciously neglect to train.

I just find it silly that a set is considered bad just because someone can't start it. I mean, if you watched her attempts, I was genuinely surprised at how weak her jumps were for a professional climber. You can tell it's within her reach if she just had a stronger jump.",Electronic-Tea6249,,1,1,2024-10-26 19:49:07

Ai is quite capable of that move. She simply failed to do so on the day.

And secondly... Ai has been astoundingly poor at any kind of jumping for a long time. She has admitted to not prioritising any training to improve in what is a glaring weakness.

That start was achievable for both Ai and anyone that height who put in a reasonable effort to a dynamic move.

I would suggest that Ai's failure to achieve the start was 100% a psychological issue on her part",vyralmonkey,,0,0,2024-10-25 23:19:16

I did notice (unless it was in a blocked link) that you avoided mentioning the Raygun/Australia breakdance drama and, waaaaaaaaaaaaay more importantly, the Netherlands Volleyball convicted pedophile, Steven van de Velde.

I appreciate that you gave an excellent overview of the French Gymnastics abuse and bullshit, which led the French-born gymnast Kaylia Nemour to claim paternal heritage and win Uneven Bars gold under the Algerian flag.

Sports at this level has got to be filled with so much abuse, cheating, poor sportsmanship. Except that's nothing new, either. I invite you to read the Wikipedia entry regarding the Men‚Äôs Marathon in the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis:

m79tmjz,t3_1i183zw,"Your writing style is very fun and cheeky. It reminds me of the late Anthony Bourdain.

I am an American who went to Paris 2024, and I had an incredible time. Every game I attended felt well organized. Crowd control in and out felt mostly well handled except for football. We stayed in a hotel a block away from the main Metro line for the venues so it was easy to get around. The frequency of trains departing after each game made it so we never felt crowd crushed.

Compared to my other trips to Paris, I was surprised how not crowded it was in the city. Sure, there were bottlenecks from Olympic traffic, but the usual city attractions like the Louvre felt empty. My understanding is a lot of locals skipped town and a lot of usual tourists also avoided coming to Paris due to the hiked up prices on hotel and travel.

I‚Äôm not going to pretend everything is hunky dory at the Olympics because I had a nice time. I know there a lot of problems that come with hosting the games, and I appreciated your insight as a local. I still left feeling very inspired by the comradely shared between nations and the collective spirit that you could really feel at each game. I am from Los Angeles, and I am hopeful my city will succeed at hosting in 2028. I am also prepared for all the drama that will come with it. Lord knows we have a lot of work to do with our infrastructure, and I hope we‚Äôre up for the challenge.

m77p5n3,t3_1i183zw,"In Poland there's been a handful of dramas at this year Olympics.

Paulina Paszek was very promising sprint canoeist, but in 2018 at 21 year old she suffered an injury and got written off. Soon after she left to work in Germany and was convinced there to return to sport. With the support she obtained she managed to overcome her injury and return to high performance in 2021, representing Germany since then. In Paris she won a bronze in K-2 500 m sprint and silver medal in K-4 500 m (canoe sprint of 2 and 4 women team). Polish team got fourth place in K-4 500 m and didn't qualify for finals of K-2 500 m.

There was also another drama in fencing. In dramatic finish with winning point in last 4 seconds (and subsequent vigorous celebration which went viral) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTlxVpUbHuo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTlxVpUbHuo) Polish women team won bronze medal in fencing (team √©p√©e). Afterwards in public interview they discussed nepotism and poor organization ot polish fencing association, which resulted in huge fallout in media.

Daria Pikulik won silver medal in omnium event (track cycling). Two days before, in an interview she complained about notorious polish cycling association (they are a drama on their own, or rather a trainwreck), a body (ir)responsible for her preparation. She said that cyclists did not receive any support and had to basically self-finance, that they got bicycles only 4 months before olympics and clothing the day before the event.

Overall, polish women won 8 medals (1 gold, 3 silver, 4 bronze), while men only 2 (1 silver, 1 bronze). This led to many snarky comments on supremacy of polish sportswomen over polish sportsmen.",megasepulator4096,,10,10,2025-01-15 03:11:39

Oh, and the woman in charge of the glass windows replacement? Got into a long argument with the ones in charge of rebuilding.

Ant is a good addition too because even if he doesn't have scoring responsibilities, he can contribute with POA defense. In the Spain exhibition game he wasn't really involved in the offense but was the primary POA defender.

Theres not a single player in the world like him and hes a mismatch nightmare for every single country. Hes a pick and roll/ lob threat every possession hes on the court. Just having his presence in the paint would give every shooter on team USA the freedom to let it fly because of his gravity and that is sorely missed on this roster.

jz52klh,t3_169wdnm,"Steph will probably play, even if he wins a championship next year. This is his last realistic shot to add the only missing component from his otherwise ridiculous award shelf - Olympic gold. Even if it means playing 18-20 minutes max, this is too good of a chance to pass up. Also, he knows Kerr too well to ignore the call.

Because Steph will play - if he is healthy -, Draymond is a lock-in as well... if he is healthy and doesn't drop off substantially in 2023-2024. Last season, he proved his value and defensive chops once again with the Warriors, being the only reliable frontcourt member besides Loongod. Also, Draymond is a Team USA vet with TWO gold medals already - a third gold will only solidify his already strong case for Basketball HOF.

Klay won't play. If anything, he will play for the Bahamas. Although I'm not sure if the Bahamas can afford to replace Gordon with Thompson, considering the fact that Gordon is much more suited for FIBA basketball.

KD will play if he is healthy and the Suns won't make the Finals. This is his shot to cement himself as the greatest Team USA player of all time. Olympic Melo will be a shadow of Olympic KD if Durant leads Team USA to their consecutive 5th gold, with him being the leader of at least two, if not THREE Olympic teams. And if KD plays, you might as well book Book. Tbf, he would deserve it anyway.

Davis will probably play if he is healthy. This is too good of a chance to be The Savior of American Bigs. Edwards and Tatum will make it, although Tatum might actually turn down the offer if the Celtics make it to the Finals or win the league. He has played A LOT of games in the summer already and he has the gold from Tokyo. Edwards is a safer bet.

I'd say Haliburton has proven his worth and need with this WC and Banchero is just a ""smart"" addition due to his youth and unique skillset with his frame.

So, I have - Curry, Edwards, Booker, KD, and Davis starting... with Banchero, Draymond, and Haliburton also locked in. Tatum is a 50/50. I'm gonna say that this is the spot where the roster completion gets more exciting.

I have a feeling that Zion and Bam can both make it, depending on their health and in Bam's case, the duration of the season. I am a believer in Cunningham and I think he has a good chance to get in as this team lacks great playmakers outside of Haliburton and Draymond (with some Curry sprinkled in). He has the FIBA body. Also, if Bam isn't making the team, I'd be surprised if JJJ is preferred before Mobley or Mitchell Robinson. Heck, I can see an interesting case for Holmgren before JJJ, if Holmgren holds up during the season and performs relatively well, especially with shooting the ball. He already has better defensive instincts than Mr I-Block-Everything-And-Foul-Out-In-15-Minutes.

I'm gonna say that one or two of Bridges, Brown, Fox, Mitchell, Reaves, Garland, Maxey, Vassell, and Holiday have a good-to-average chance to make it in as well, depending on how their next season goes... And Embiid can make it anytime if he decides to represent the USA after the lackluster showing from our bigs in WC, especially if Team USA feels that Davis might skip the Olympics.

It's a crowded field. I do not anticipate Trae Young making it, due to his public debacles. I have serious doubts about LeBron, Kawhi, Dame, and Harden. I consider George an iffy candidate, although not impossible. I do not know what to think of Butler and his willingness to commit to Team USA, but I think he is also rather iffy. Irving's shiny moments with Team USA are probably over at this point.

From this WC roster, only Edwards and Haliburton have actually proved themselves in a FIBA setting. Bridges, Brunson, Banchero, and Reaves have had their moments, but only Banchero stands out due to his youth and body and is more suitable for FIBA than what Bridges, Reaves, and Brunson are offering. I am really monitoring the development of Kessler, Duren, and Mark Williams - the three young bigs who are definitely on the radar if one or both of Davis and Bam decide not to commit. Kessler, Duren, and Williams have the body type and rebounding ability that Team USA desperately needs. Even if Draymond is playing crunch minutes, like he did in Tokyo.",StevenAdamsT800,,4,4,2023-09-04 20:16:03

It almost sounds like he is either more than a single individual somehow or that it's like changing the channel of his one body. 

Forget about connecting him to the Harliquin he sounds more like Mr.HH the 2nd. He's documented as an inciting antagonistic organizing presence at every labor strike. Mr. HH assisted various splinter groups in inciting resistance against the US government during the colonial expansion. The only real difference being that he is opposed to corporations instead of the government. If he  is the personification of mass consciousness of the US population perhaps HH was the same but for the people who already lived in the areas that were claimed (cough cough stolen cough) during the colonial expansion? 

Was Christoph the splinterman? Or was it just a coincidence  they called the splinterman the company man? I ask because he mentioned being attacked at homestead but he was captured during the 67 riot. If it was Christoph why didn't he take him into custody then?

lfdd52u,t3_1eeaomz,"It's really a noncontroversy being made into a big deal for nothing. Various media have depicted their own interpretations of The Last Supper and no one bat an eye - The Sopranos, The Simpsons, etc. 

Furthermore, you see a blue guy covered in grapes with a cup of wine and no one thinks ""oh hey that's Dionysus!""? That's the most obvious tip off that it wasn't about The Last Supper and it was an homage to the Feast of Dyonisus; cuz, you know, the Olympics are Greek and Dyonisus is the god of drama, wine and revelry? And the central figure with the ""halo"" which isn't a halo but the crown - Corona Borealis - that Dyonisus (oh look there he is again!) gave to Ariadne. 

If anything, it was a creative way to express the fusion of the origins of the Olympics (Greek) with the religion of the host country (Christianity). And if anyone knows France (hell, Europe) they don't have the same sensibility about being comically subversive about things they still respect.

lfe10g8,t3_1eeaomz,"This is even more hypocritical than you think.  They have invented something out of thin air to be offended about. It was never ""The Last Supper"". 

* *The performance in question was not mocking Christianity. It was a re-creation of ""The Feast of Dionysus,"" an artwork inspired by Dionysus, also known as Bacchus, the Greek god of wine, fertility, and revelry. To understand this piece, it's essential to research Dionysus and his cultural significance. Dionysus was celebrated through festivals like the Dionysia, which included dramatic performances similar to the one at the Olympics opening ceremony.*
* *...The Last Supper is just one of many artworks from that era depicting people gathered around a table, a popular artistic motif of the time.*
* *The ""blue guy"" in the performance represents the statue of Dionysus, and his microphone and lack of clothing are symbolic elements that should not be overlooked. Understanding these details requires looking beyond initial reactions and delving into the cultural and artistic context of the piece.*
* *In conclusion, before jumping to conclusions or feeling offended, it's important to educate ourselves about the cultural significance and historical background of the art we encounter.*

I saw a video comparing it to like the 2008 Olympics in China or something like that, they did this like drum performance thing with glow sticks, and the lights turned on and off and it was just an absolutely stunning visual spectacle.

lff0106,t3_1eeaomz,"‚ÄúMan will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest.‚Äù
- Denis Diderot. 

France has produced some of the towering giants in the fight against theocracy and in favour of the Enlightenment principles of equality and human rights which we now all enjoy. 

Something that will never disappear from French culture is the habit of reminding religion not to get too full of itself. To go to France to understand its culture, and the tremendous advances in human liberty which it has championed over the years, is to go to a place where it is possible to not take religion too seriously. And many will indulge in that freedom. And most will remind you that it is one of the freedoms to be treasured. 

It is the least surprising thing ever for France to stage a pageant that does nothing more than just make you think.  What if? And if that offends anyone, it offends all the right people. May the world continue to offend them. 

France begins with the religion it knows best, a religion which for a thousand years it let run amok unchallenged. Just a gentle ribbing. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt it make you think? What if?‚Äù  They start at home but in so doing it sets out a useful precedent for all the other religions and doctrines which so desperately need to be re-examined with a bit of irreverence. They‚Äôve set down a precedent: ‚ÄúIf we can do this with our own culture and history, so can anyone.‚Äù  It‚Äôs helpful in itself but it‚Äôs even more helpful in setting the stage for the next step which is to extend this precedent far more broadly across the world‚Äôs moribund and self-important pious heavy-handed meddlers which have been on the rise for sometimes. 

France looks at their own history and tells eveyone who thinks they have a direct phone line to some kind of magic divinity, ‚ÄúGet over yourselves. Put your feet back on the ground. Look, here‚Äôs how we did it!‚Äù And it‚Äôs a beautiful example of what French history has produced at its best.",slashcleverusername,,1,1,2024-07-29 00:20:39

For MAG, I have no idea. But while I want \*all\* the gymnasts to be at the Olympics, I don't know that this data actually shows that we're missing out significantly on medal contenders if we don't consider that they may just be incorporated into the team with a slightly larger team size.

h7axnr5,t3_oph2ls,"I think the 'disaster' and 'nightmare' assessments of our overall performance at these Games are unfair. The support shown for the Irish team has been very positive, but maybe we should slightly adjust our expectations. We had less than ten realistic medal hopefuls and it looks like we'll end up with four medals, which is quite reasonable in my opinion. The margins between success and failure in the Olympics are so tight that it's almost reductive to look solely at the medal table.

Kurt Walker won the third round of his bout last night on four of the judges' scorecards. If the fifth judge had also given it in his favour, he would have been into a semi final and guaranteed at least a bronze medal. 

Rory McIlroy came within inches of a bronze medal. Had he holed his birdie putt on the last, he would have ended up on his own in third. Instead, it slipped agonisingly by and he would go on to suffer a cruel lip out in the play-off for bronze when there was just three of them left in it.

As Rhys said in his interview, one misplaced finger was all it took to put him slightly out of sync which then caused him to slip up. On another day he nails the routine and picks up a medal, though it was always going to be a tough ask for him to pull it off in his first Olympic final.

Seems like Ireland is aiming to improve its medal haul over the next few Olympics. A new High Performance Strategy has been laid out inspired by New Zealand, a country with a similar population size which went from a string of mediocre Olympic showings to becoming a medal powerhouse and regular top 10-20 nation. The trick, it seems, was not just funding, training, and equipment, but prioritizing sports based on both Olympic and non-Olympic success record, and the number of possible medal events in a sport. For New Zealand, this meant pouring money into stuff like rowing, sailing, cycling, and athletics and giving targetted attention to other sports where there was potential, while leaving underperforming sports like archery and table tennis out in the cold (NZ had regularly qualified athletes in those sports prior to Beijing, but they never did particularly well, so most of their funding was redirected to the others).

The Cameroonian lad had absolutely no regard for the rules of the sport whatsoever - he punched Walsh in the back of the head like 15 times, below the belt like 5, ignored the ref repeatedly and I'm pretty sure he accidentally hit the ref at one stage too.

Russian judge would have even had Ayissi winning the fight but for the deductions and would have been 1 point in it with the Mongolian judge, which is absolutely laughable. Walsh was clearly the better fighter.",iiEviNii,,7,7,2021-07-27 07:51:27

mcydroc,t3_1iok4n3,"[I wrote this comment to explain the Fedez controversy in another place, but I thought it was too long, so I deleted most of it. I'm gonna post the full comment here just to keep all the Fedez discussion in a single spot XD. And because I thought that it wouldn't annoy anyone if it was here. Most of what I wrote, you alredy did in your post, so it'll be a bit of a repetition]


I'm not the best to talk about Fedez since I don't follow him, but...

To add to what has alredy been said: Fedez is one of those ""grey"" personalities that manages to be neither ""white"" (he's been involvend in many controversies and unflattering gossip) nor ""black"" (he still manages to appear quite human and vulnerable, especially when he's struggling, and in general he appears much more sympathetic than other controversial artists such as Morgan).

It's like Fedez has many contradictory sides. On one hand, it seems like he can't keep himself out of the gossip and the pubblic eye (he was judge at xFactor, active on socials, was accused of being overbearing and an ""attention w*ore"" in a podcast he had with one of his friends, he usually answers to provocations, he's vocal about his opinions on politics and such); but on the other hand, he seems very emotionally vulnerable to stress, which of course comes with too much exposure.

He has the reputation of someone who involves his friends in every aspect of his life including work; only for then argue and part ways with them in a very drastic way (is there even a friend he didn't split up with??).

He sorta gives an image of ""family man"" in some aspects (he has a very close relationship with his mother that also keeps in check some of his business, and he's playful with his kids), but he also cheated on his wife and it's unclear whether he ever loved her or it was just a physical and business relationship to him (he's lucky that his ex-wife Chiara Ferragni is currently involved in an even bigger scandal). Plus, many didn't like that he and Chiara chose to make the life of their children basically public domain (they were both influencers, so they shared a lot of their private life online, including their children. Now they stopped because of the divorce).

He did charity work and donations, but there's been at least one time where he used charity to cover up for something where he (or ""they"", since his wife was also involved) truly messed up: so, he was also accused of strumentalizing charity.

He wants to give the impression of a blunt person that doesn't shy away from recognizing his faults and that is open about both his good and bad sides, but you could also find arguments to claim that he's ""fake"". He's very good at discussing, reasoning out and communicating his point of view, but he's also pretty impulsive.

So, there's a big part of the public that is truly fed up with him and all the gossip that he always brings. When Fedez was announced as a partecipant, I myself kinda thought ""no, please not Fedez again!"". He's a singer, but he's definitely more talked about because of the gossip than because of his songs. But on the other hand, he still has a fanbase, and people that are ready to focus on the good sides of his person. The reason why he still has people that defend him is that, as far as I know... He never truly ""harmed"" anyone that much? I mean, he definitely wasn't good to his wife, and I think he's definitely able to be opportunistic and hide his most inconvenient behaviours. But he also seems way more self-sabotaging than damaging to others. The fact that he had health issues in recent years also adds to the picture.

But what I said is just what I casually saw discussed around, I never followed him and I'm not informed about the details. So, if someone wants to correct me on something that I said wrong, please do.

mi3j5iz,t3_1jcmlch,">Israeli lobbying group ‚ÄúAIPAC‚Äù gets special treatment in the United States by not having to register as a foreign agent; there are less than 200,000 Israeli Americans and yet AIPAC is one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington D.C.

What do you mean ""special treatment""?  Has CAIR registered as a foreign agent?  The Armenia Assembly of America?

>AIPAC has openly bought scores politicians on both sides of the aisle and paid over $100 million in 2024 to unseat American politicians critical of Israel

Okay - who?  And for the people you identify, are they also considered bought by every other group that donated to them?

The reason statements like this get called anti-semitic isn't because it is anti-Israel.  It is because you are looking at something AIPAC did and instead of judging it the same way you would judge almost anyone else making contributions to a politician, you jump to ""bought and paid for"".  Which *just so happens* to mirror the antisemitic conspiracy theory behind the protocols of the elder of zion and illuminati conspiracy theories that led to a lot of murder.

>There‚Äôs no Hamas in the West Bank but the United States supports Israel conducting operations there anyway

There is Hamas in the West Bank.  Even a quick google would show this wasn't a true statement.

>Even amid the ‚Äúculture war‚Äù and lack of common decency in politics, neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump released the unredacted Epstein files; this implies there is a significant, bipartisan inconvenience surrounding the unredacted release of the files

While not explicitly stated, the inclusion of this in a post about Israel strong suggests you believe that Epstein/the child rape was part of an Israeli plot.  Take a step back - where is the evidence?  Is there maybe another conspiracy theory about jews hurting children that this might seem strikingly similar to?

>The current Trump administration is the most aggressively pro-Israel administration in American history, and is catastrophically vulnerable to espionage/blackmail due to lack of vetting practices and mass dismissal/resignations of experienced, competent rank & file personnel

Why Israel?  Why not China?  Saudi Arabia?  Germany?  Really ask yourself why *Israel* is your focus on something that on the surface, has nothing to do with them.",Lorata,,14,14,2025-03-16 15:09:39
mi3yg6b,t3_1jcmlch,"Let me try to change your view on just one of these points: you wrote, ""There‚Äôs no Hamas in the West Bank...""

Hamas absolutely has military presence in the West Bank. It's not even a secret: it's just limited to certain areas, such as Jenin. [Here](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-hamas-commander.html) is an NYT article reporting on the Israeli military having killed one of the Hamas commanders in Jenin; Hamas did not deny the man's affiliation, and publicly mourned his death.",Thumatingra,,8,8,2025-03-16 16:28:04
mi3g7wg,t3_1jcmlch,"AIPAC is not as influential as you might think.   
They are outspent by various organizations, including guns, tech companies, accountant union and many others. IIRC they are somewhere in the middle-bottom of top50 political spending.  
Generally, you think they are more influential than they actually are because of an alignment of interests - AIPAC has the interest of showing how influential they are to appeal for donations as well as to politicians. Antisemites have the interest of promoting the conspiracy that Jews control the US. Opposition to Israel have the interest to promote the ""AIPAC is against me"" to gather votes this way. 

Moreover, they are purely American organization. First amendment and all, if you actually read the laws, they shouldn't register as a foreign entity, and other organizations promote similar things for other countries (India has a pretty large lobby I think). 

Lastly, I don't even think Epstein was Israeli... I don't think his influence went through AIPAC, just a rich person with a lot of dirty information on many people. What you say about Mossad was never proven, just another conspiracy. 

I can go on to the rest of the post if you want... just that I think you fell for an antisemitic conspiracy.

What is antisemitic, however, is saying that the state of Israel should be destroyed and that Jews do not have a right to safety and sovereignty within our ancestral homeland.

Don't think this is only right wing. There are plenty of feminists who are demonising Algerian boxer woman

This is another reminder on how labeling is often not sufficient

For many women, feminism is always capped by girlboss feminism. They want equality and upliftment but also believe in separation of feminine n masculine 

For some this is a way to impose racism, imperialism and western superiority. It's no suprise that this issue occured during a fight between Italian n Algerian boxer. These two countries have been historically close in culture. Both were parts of Roman empire n Mediterranean trade. The people look similar but are divided by modern artificial white vs non-white lens

What I do see is people questioning whether it is fair to women without biological abnormalities to make them compete against people with such abnormalities that give them an unfair advantage.

Nobody I have seen thinks that is Khalif‚Äôs fault, everyone recognizes the fault is with the governing bodies who have been unwilling to tackle the issue and a way that is fair to women.

Khalif suffers from a tragic biological condition. This is a case where the expression ‚Äúassigned female at birth‚Äú is actually appropriate.

Nobody checks babies‚Äô chromosomes, they rely on visible genitals. an incomplete way of identifying biological sex.

It isn‚Äôt an accident that intersex people with conditions that produce abnormally high testosterone levels end up world champions in the female category in sports where that is important.

They just take advantage of the rules as they are, why not? It is up to the adults in the room to change the rules to make them fair to normal women.

There‚Äôs nothing fair about making the ‚Äúwoman‚Äù category a residual one, where if someone isn‚Äôt absolutely male in all aspects, they must be female.

This paragraph by itself is enough to put me off. Her name is Barbie, and she looks like a Barbie doll. *Barbie* is her name, get it? Clever, huh?

The depictions of mental health and therapy are infuriating.

He does question at one point saying something along the lines of ‚Äúwhy is this happening to me?‚Äù And ‚Äúwhat is god punishing me for?‚Äù But its never brought to light how poorly he had treated his ex girlfriend during their breakup when he had spent the night with kathy. 
He broke up with his ex over a phone call and hung up abruptly never mentioning the cheating either. Isnt this exactly what kathy did? Never mentioned the cheating. Its very funny actually 
And as for kathy‚Äôs character- infidelity was not a surprise. This is what happened before and was bound to happen again.

I didn't see the twist coming partly because I stopped caring about Theo and felt like he was unbelievable because he was written so poorly and he kept acting out-of-character for the therapist he supposedly was. It seems like too much credit to call Theo an unreliable narrator when the author was just a bad writer.

lruq0fi,t3_1cn07pq,"Omg. I never comment stuff on reddit but I'm writing this as I'm reading this post in real time bc I agree with you so hard and I'm so mad about it. 

A) LITERALLY WHY DOES EVERYONE LOVE COLLEEN HOOVER SO MUCH. I WAS NEVER A HUGE READER BUT THEN GOT RLY INTO READING LAST YEAR AND I JUST COULDNT TELL IF I HAVE BAD TASTE OR IF EVERYONE ELSE JUST SUCKS. You're so right. This writing reminds me so much of it. I read Verity and thought I must be insane because why in the hell did everyone push that book on me so hard. If Colleen Hoover has no haters, guess I'll be seeing you in the afterlife bestie. 

B) I never even thought of this as being like a movie script, but you're totally right. I just thought he sucked at writing from different perspectives. I, too, hated Alicia's diary entries. I kept thinking that the author must not have ever written (or read, for that matter) a diary.

C) THEO'S HERO COMPLEXXXXXXXXX Oh my god, from the perspective of a Psychology degree-holder (hiiii), I found it absolutely unfathomable that he would ever be allowed within 20 feet of that patient. Even if he was, by some miracle, staffed by such out of touch, hundred-year-old clinicians as the ones described; no way he would have been allowed near that patient. I have so much more to say about the clinical stuff because believe me I could go on for hours. It was immediately crystal fucking clear to me that this book was not written by anyone with any formal education or experience in psychology or any adjacent field (as if the opening Freud quote wasn't clear enough!!!). We'll get there. 

(It deserves a post of its own, tbh. The depiction of Psychology in this book is so bad. So, so, so bad. Except Ruth, Ruth was was the only (ONLYYYY) character that seemed to have any legitimacy, and I suspect the dialogue from Ruth may have been taken from the author's personal experience with a good therapist. Everyone else, jail. ANYWAY moving on, I have so much more to say on this front.)

D) OH MY GOD THE YURI STUFF MADE ME SO MAD. WHAT DO YOU MEEEEEEAN HE'S A GOOD MAN?!? HE'S LITERALLY CREEPY AS HELL??? AND ALSO EVIDENTLY DEALING DRUGS TO THE PATIENTS???

E) I also noticed all the weird racist/xenophobic stuff. It kept giving me the ick too, especially that first comment about Yuri's ""perfect English"". I've noticed a similar seemingly subconscious appraisal for assimilation to whiteness from other UK writers, so I was wondering if that might have something to do with it. I'm American, so believe me when I say that I know Americans are in no place to talk, but it's just a very specific type of characterization that I've noticed a lot in books that take place in the UK. I've noticed that American microaggressions in literature tend to result in either A) the complete omission of any significant POC characters whatsoever, or B) very self-aware and actively, blatantly racist characterizations. I hate it here. 

F) The misogyny and sex-forward stuff goes HAND IN FRICKIN HAND BABY. Ohhhh my god I hate it, it's so cringey and so clearly man-writing-women. All the pointless mentions of sex. And when he first introduces Indira and describes her as ""attractive"", but describes Yuri as ""good-looking"". It's a slight change in word choice, but one that carries contextual weight. Just one of those little things that I always notice when people describe physical appearances.

I totally agree, I have no issue with sex. Just when it gets thrown in for no reason. I don't even mind smut if it's well done and makes sense for the book. But again, that has a purpose (even if self-indulgent). 

And shall we talk about the fact that sex was such a common occurrence, yet was never even MENTIONED from a psychoanalytic perspective? Hmmm?? Did someone say Freud???

G) YOU DID!!!! YOU SAID FREUD!!!!!! DEAR GOD THANK YOU. THIS IS THE MOMENT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. Hold on I'm gonna read through this whole medical malpractice section then collect my thoughts. Brb. 

H) I'm back, I made it to Risperidone before I felt the need to chime in again. You're correct, RIS is an atypical antipsychotic that is typically prescribed for schizophrenia, bipolar I, and autism. Unofficial uses (non-FDA approved, but allowed on a case-by-case basis as OP said) are abundant, but often involve violent or aggressive acute episodes of psychoses in borderline, dementia, delusional disorders, the list goes on. 
While it's true that it is not prescribed as a sedative, the ""sedative"" effects of RIS as described in Alicia, are actually relatively accurate depictions of the side effects of RIS at high doses (muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, hypersalivation, shuffling gait, tremors, fixed or ""mask-like"" stare). These effects would be referred to as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). There are tons of other serious adverse effects of RIS, but the Parkinsonian features are not uncommon in mismanaged patients. That whole unit should be shut down, but I digress.

Btw, one of the most common side effects of RIS is weight gain. Funny how that little omission fits in with the rest of our aforementioned grievances. 

I'm not even gonna get into the dosing. I don't remember the specifics off the top of my head, but I remember reading them and thinking it was all out of whack. Not to mention inconsistent with her behavioral responses. Long-term RIS treatment typically results in tardive dyskinesia (or late-onset EPS; TD is a movement disorder that causes involuntary muscle spasms and often writhing or jerky movements and postures), which was also not mentioned; and although it is possible to abruptly withdraw a patient from RIS, it would likely cause strong withdrawal symptoms, and the TD would likely persist. And it shouldn't have been prescribed in the first place.

Also. Final note before I shut up. This man has no idea what BPD is. Homie just heard someone mention ""borderline"" and ran with it. All of his depictions of psychological disorders are either inconsistent with DSM criteria, or really lazy, stereotypical and largely inaccurate behaviors of maybe a single criterion for the given disorder. And his portrayals of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists are even worse.

Please y'all. This book is so uninformed by any psychological or neurological basis it's not even funny. Some tidbits here and there, like infancy being constantly traumatic, are kinda true. And the stuff Ruth says to Theo is great. Very inline with good cognitive behavioral therapy. The rest of it is... whew. THE STUFF HE SAYS ABOUT ABUSE CYCLES, WHEW. Anyway. Thank you for this extremely in-depth rant. I just finished the book and needed to rant myself hahaha ü§ôüèª",Real-Owl4007,,7,7,2024-10-14 09:55:13
l35yfkc,t3_1cn07pq,"You mentioned Colleen Hoover, and I'm one of those who recently read Verity on a recommendation from a friend. What you say here about the (paraphrasing your review) ""every situation leads to sex"" was my big takeaway from Verity. It felt like I was just reading this woman's personal sex fantasy disguised as some sort of story with a massively predictable twist. This sounds a lot like the same.

Plenty of people enjoy that sort of thing, but I always feel like when authors beat you over the head with that same theme over and over it turns into a parody of itself and, at least for me, makes it totally unenjoyable.

The stuff just _sells_ though, which is why we keep getting more of it and why some of these otherwise unremarkable authors get continued book and movie deals. I feel like there is plenty of room for something in between that is well written, still sex-charged, has believable twist(s), and still doesn't feel bluntly written, but...ugh.

Somebody recently said to me that the best kind of plot twist in any medium is one that you don't see coming, but immediately kick yourself and say wow, that was obvious or makes total sense in hindsight. It's undoubtedly a difficult thing to pull off. Likewise, a powerful sex scene is one that is built up to, with characters that have some tension between them and aren't just banging in every other chapter.

l34fz4l,t3_1cn07pq,"I've read similar reviews on goodreads before reading the book and most of the people who are not satisfied with the book are the ones that have some knowledge about psychiatry. I guess it has mostly good notes on goodreads because most of the readers don't have psychiatry knowlede and they just go over the inaccuracies. 

Personally I liked the book, although I could spot some of the inaccuracies that you've mentioned. I didn't have high expectations and read it during a rainy weekend. It was fast to read and sometimes enjoyable. Also, the fact that it was written like a screenplay helped with the story twist.

I wouldn't say it's a waste of time. I've read worse books (since you mentioned Colleen Hoover, Verity felt like a real waste of time compared to this). In my opinion it's not a 5/5 but certainly is not a 1/5 book. I would put it somewhere between 3-4/5.

l346wph,t3_1cn07pq,"While I agree that the novel is not great in terms of prose and craft, I don't believe it is a 1-star book.

The Silent Patient commercially succeeds despite its flaws because it keeps the reader hooked, and the final twist catches a lot of entry-level thriller readers off guard. The characters were intriguing and a bit unlikeable; however, they could have benefitted from a bit more layering.

The writing and prose are definitely not something to talk about‚Äîit's very barebones and pedestrian, but that also has an advantage; it's accessible to all readers, native and non-native English speakers.

Although Michaelides didn't do a good job depicting the whole facets of psychology, he does have degrees in the field and has worked in therapy, so it's pretty much the opinion of an expert.

Your arguments about racism and misogyny are very thin‚ÄîI am Arabic, and if I meet a European who speaks perfect Arabic, I'd be VERY impressed much like Theo was impressed with a foreigner speaking perfect English. Nothing to be offended by.

Also, 

>**Alicia Berenson:**¬†Alicia is a walking contradiction.  
  
We are told that she is beautiful, charming, sophisticated, but she instead comes across as an anti-social, paranoid shut in with serious co-dependency issues.  
  
She has no friends, no relationships outside of her husband Gabriel, no hobbies, or interests outside of painting and having sex with her husband.  
  
All she does in her chapters is paint, have arguments with people, have sex, and walk around.

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a flaw in writing, in my opinion it is a very reasonable perception vs reality thing, like someone can be described to be something and not actually be that something, especially Alicia because she is a very infamous person and people project themselves onto her, they see what they want to see, and because she doesn‚Äôt talk, nobody really knows her except the image of her from before she killed her husband, which isn‚Äôt what it seems to be on the surface. Being a walking contradiction is very human, i find a lot of people are like that actually. 

I am also torn between whether it is because of Alicia‚Äôs co dependency issues and being attached to her favourite person Gabriel (im assuming she is borderline as she seems to be and it is also said a lot in the book) that she has nothing much going on about her other than gabriel and painting, or if this is a result of one-dimensional/flat writing, especially worse as a female character.

Now coming to the end of the book we find out that Kathy had completely let herself ho she was depressed and not working and had gained weight and eating crap just watching and lying in the sofa so all theo worked for just for Kathy¬† had been taken away from him he had lost her so hadn't he got the punishment for his sins I mean the one thing that he wanted was taken away from him¬†


The morally right that he should have left Kathy when he found out or confronted her and given time to her instead of acting crazy but the best thing would be to leave her and when he eventually got rid of Gabriel why didn't he give his best shot at Kathy when he had all the things cleared ( while managing treating Alicia I know its hard but still)¬†


You know one more thing about Kathy that he had initially cheated on her then partner with theo so there isn't much to trust if she could betray someone once of course she could do it again¬†
The same thing may not be applicable for theo (inspite of the same thing) because what he was longing for all his life was with him (Kathy) so there is no that he would betray her trust.

mnd1v3i,t3_1cn07pq,"I don't agree with your misogynistic opinion of the book. I think Alicia's journal entries were genuinely immersive and added to the plot. I didn't really care about the sex scenes, but it showed how her relationship with Gabriel relied on physical intimacy and every time those scenes did occur, Alicia always seemed to use it as a way to comfort herself and say, ""Yeah of course he still loves me, we still have sex."" But in reality he never did. I also found her admiration and love for Gabriel intense and made the plot twist meaningful. I remember her saying that she wanted to crawl into him. He was clearly her only source of comfort.


Also, it is really obvious that the mental health treatment and such is meant to be bad. Theo is meant to be a bad psychologist, he just considers himself a good one because he is a narcissist. The psychiatric facility was barely functioning due to its lack of funding, that means the psychiatrists will suck and call their patients bitches. And just because the psychiatrists referred to a few patients as bitches, that doesn't automatically make them misogynistic.¬†

mke294p,t3_1cn07pq,"Thanks for sharing this. I feel like there are a lot of over-hyped positive reviews out there for this book and I don‚Äôt really understand it.

Yes, this book was a quick and easy read, which is great if you need a break from a long series. The chapters are short and written with punchy sentences, so I was initially sucked in. However, I have to agree with OP on pretty much everything else‚Ä¶ the characters just exist to serve the plot and have very little depth, the psychology is awful, and I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the ending in the least. Everything just went flat when I made it to the punch line.

Spoiler Alert.

Theo is painted as this empath throughout the book that is obsessed with Alicia and has a strong survivor complex. I‚Äôm sure the purpose for this was solely to divert our attention away from Theo as the suspect. Within the last 30 pages, however, his character completely changes. This isn‚Äôt a plot twist, it‚Äôs a scam to make us think that we missed something important and weren‚Äôt intelligent enough to put the pieces together. There‚Äôs no trust in the reader.

At the end, Theo shows up at Alicia‚Äôs place, expecting to find Gabriel who he‚Äôs been stalking for a couple of weeks at this point. But Gabriel happens to be caught up at work and he just finds Alicia at home. He feels a sudden ‚Äúthrill‚Äù and then puts on gloves, a mask, and the next thing we know he has a knife to her throat and he‚Äôs ‚Äúliving it up‚Äù. Isn‚Äôt this supposed to be a crime of passion? He also ties her up and torments her for FOUR hours before Gabriel gets home; and merely hits him in the head with a gun when he arrives. Theo exposes Gabriel‚Äôs secret, unties them both, and leaves. This makes NO SENSE.

And what is with all of the characters?? I felt like there was an unnecessary amount of characters, which I‚Äôm sure existed just as a distraction. We don‚Äôt know any of them well enough to form any kind of bond. Except for maybe Theo and Alicia, but it‚Äôs a weak bond at that.

Alternate ending.

Alicia having a multiple personality disorder would have been much more interesting imo. The trauma from her childhood could have caused her to dissociate, forming one personality to express her anger / capable of murder, one personality to express her love and vulnerability, and a third that just completely shuts down and won‚Äôt speak. This would have been a much better interpretation of her ‚Äúvow of silence‚Äù as opposed to just not having anything to say for six years‚Ä¶ ummmm.

All-in-all I have to agree with OP. Don‚Äôt read this book. Had I enjoyed the ending, I may have recommended it for a short punchy read between series, but ugh not worth it.",Amazing-Roll-230,,1,1,2025-03-29 18:00:52

mr760ms,t3_1cn07pq,"Finished the book a couple of hours ago. Tbh, I would rate it 3.5. Not good but not bad either. Before starting the book, my intuition did tell me the plot twist already but while reading the story I was going back and forth on the characters. 

The book at times did feel a mess at places. At times I would close the book and rethink about what exactly was written. I felt like the story didn't dawn upon the characters' personality much. It would always start by describing their physical appearances. While it's not really uncommon in books, here it felt a bit out of place. 

The thing which bugged me the most was the ending.... It felt very anti-climatic. Well we all know that theo would be in jail after the inspector visited him but what did he feel/live in jail? What about kathy? What about Alicia now that Grove was closing down? Would she still be in psychiatric care or in jail with thoe now that the truth is out? I mean she did pull that trigger, it's still a murder. Does ruth visit him in jail? If she does, how would she talk to him, harshly or still has that motherly factor? 

I also hoped that the storyline would have bounced between the characters at the grove. We did dwell upon christian and touched yuri. But it would have been interesting to include the processor too (I forgot his name lol). 

The book also talked about how Alicia was 'unstable' or 'mentally ill'. You have to be in her position to understand it. And even if she was, it isn't appropriate to describe the patients so. A main quality of psychiatrist or psychologist is to have empathy. 

Overall, it would have been better but it's already better than some books in the market so I'll give it that point",LandscapeVisual7667,,1,1,2025-05-08 05:34:49

Which is all a long way of saying: what was their goal?

Specifically between the time they qualified and the start of the Tour de France?

They must have known that they were outclassed, and not even prepared, since most of the team dropped out.  

I‚Äôve had friendly race directors follow me, taking down the signs as I pass (when I am the last person). I think they are friendly because they know I am taking it seriously. I‚Äôm not misrepresenting myself (as is so common on the entertaining Marathon Investigation blog), just slow. 

I think that is what this team missed: they can lose- or come in last- with honor‚Ä¶ if they are honest about their abilities.

lg8hss4,t3_1eicytv,"I've seen the boxers being described as having 'previously failed gender testing'.

I've tried to figure out what they mean by this, and from what I can tell, the use of 'gender testing' is deliberately misleading and it seems the women boxers in question are both cisgender and simply had or have much higher than average female testosterone levels naturally. 

One sports commentator explained that there are cisgender women with T naturally in the male range. (Presumably at the lower end of this range?)

The use of this term has lead transphobes to assume these boxers are trans women exploiting physiological developmental advantages to beat up on women, and others to speculate that they were born with internal testes.

Whatever the case with them, I believe the term ""gender testing"" is deliberately transphobic. They could have described the issue perfectly well and more precisely without *[bringing] gender into it, since, it doesn't seem to be relevant at all. 

...If I have understood this properly, then it just goes to show that there is no perfect fairness in competitive sport, as elite winning athletes will always have some natural advantage -- be it height, reach, the ability to build muscle easily, a greater proportion of fast twitch muscles and neurological advantages, etc.",Super7Position7,,7,7,2024-08-03 01:34:00

lg9fkt7,t3_1eicytv,"This has been happening in women's sports for years. They like to blame transpeople for that, but gender testing has been going on for decades before transgender was even a thing.

It doesn't happen in mens sport and many women consider gender testing is actually linked to misogyny. A number of women has written books about sex testing and how women who were really good, but may not have looked feminine enough were targeted. Doesn't happen in mens sport for example Phelps who had numerous physical and biological advantages.

The media are losing their minds over this. Lisa Nandy is commenting and the un raccenteur is now involved. Lisa said it was an uncomfortable watch but then went on to say it was complex biological. All the boxers are now starting to say it's  unfair, it looks more like what happened in the witch trials. These 2 women  athletes  are dammed if they win or lose now. I think it's hysteria. A rumour that has now created a false narrative about them. 41 seconds was a short bout, but she did get a good punch in that broke her nose. I don't think that is necessarily itself remarkable, unless you stick the she's a man and it's unfair as a narrative. But let's look at facts. Women boxers have knocked out other women in a quicker time. The best woman boxer of recent times knocked one out in 7 seconds. The boxing records of all Olympic boxers are good. The 2 boxers in question are also good, but they lost a lot as well and also have placed low in the Olympics previously.  The other boxer won after going the distance but the controversy is still there.  The entire thing is a lose lose for women. It will bring back sex testing for women sport. Transgender women will be blamed even though it's nothing to do with them. Misogyny in sport will reign. But if the elite women  do bring it back it needs to be for all women in sport. At this point I feel women in elite sport are bringing this on themselves now. It's like the women MAGA republicans. They just don't see this is all an attack on women and they will have to live with the consequences for decades. Doesn't happen in male sport just saying.

One of the funniest (Easter egg?) moments for me this year was the end of *Scream VI*.  And like you, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was supposed to enjoy *Asteroid City* as an homage to a time period or a love letter to Anderson himself. 

Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt seem to agree with anyone on *Top Gun*. I thought the storyline was a forced nostalgic script with money shots (the glamour shot with the car was beyond ridiculous). Maybe I‚Äôd like to see Tom Cruise do something that isn‚Äôt action/sci-fi. But I‚Äôm also a weirdo who enjoyed his acting in *Eyes Wide Shut* (even though the movie was a solid 2/10).

kfpj225,t3_18v7k6g,"Incredible. I can never imagine watching this many movies. 

I myself have seen only 8 new releases this year üíÄ here's my ranking:-

08. Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantamania - Was expecting it to be the best Ant-Man movie but sadly it was the worst. Atleast Johnathan Majors' Kang was pretty good.

07. The Flash - Honestly, it wasn't as bad as people made it out to be but it wasn't very good either. Both Barry's had a pretty good story arc and as expected Michael Keaton still rocks as the Batman.

06. Extraction 2 - Thrilling action paired up with a badass lead and you got a banger of an action flick. The plot is nothing amazing tho which is fine.

05. Sisu - Finnish John Wick meets Indiana Jones. The lack of dialogue and exposition made the movie even better imo.

04. Asteroid City - I don't know if I fully grasped everything this movie had to offer but it was truly an unique experience. I have a feeling it's gonna get better with multiple viewings.

03. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 - This movie is the perfect example that you don't have to kill off characters to provide a closure to the journey. It's most definitely the best MCU movie since Endgame.

02. Oppenheimer - Christopher Nolan continues to prove that he's one of the best filmmakers of our generation. Brilliant script, immaculate pacing and great performances all in one. Not to mention Ludwig G√∂ransson's incredible soundtrack.

01. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse - This movie was truly an immersive experience from start to finish. Truly the most beautiful piece of animation I've ever seen in my life.

Well.... That's it for me. I'll try to watch more movies next year.

His reasoning is that 90/100 should represent the best movies of all time, and there shouldn't be a lot of them.  In any given year, if a movie hits low 70s, it's often in his top 10 list.  It's rare in any year to have any movies 8/10 or higher.

Your scale, by contrast, is for a specific year, so it can be harder to compare one year against another (which is why this guy is so harsh, so he can judge if a certain year is highly rated or not).  Also, he is very picky after watching so many movies.",cafezinho,,2,2,2023-12-31 21:25:19

To understand Miyazaki, his films are not straightforward. it's less about the story, and more about soaking up the visuals, moment to moment feelings. 

He does this by not having a script at all. He directs his films purely through visuals, not knowing how a story ends when he starts drawing it. His films are best appreciated by handing over the wheel, and just going for the ride with a receptive mind. The beautiful hand-drawn animation and score is what makes this possible for me.

Even a midnight screening experience with a rowdy crowd and Harmony Korine himself in attendance couldn‚Äôt save this disaster. People will try to convince you this is a future cult classic masterpiece or something. Do not listen. It's Neal Breen by the way of Gaspar Noe by the way of pain & suffering. Watch at your own risk. Only reason it‚Äôs not a 0 is because of a few unintentional laughs. Probably more effective if you're under the influence of drugs, or possessed by the devil.*

Well, thanks for the laugh. Here's my list, copied over from an r/boxoffice thread.

1. Titanic 3D rerelease. Just amazing to see on the big screen. 6/6.
2. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. It was fine enough. M.O.D.O.K. got a laugh out of the theater at the face reveal. 4/6.
3. The Whale. Heart wrenching third act. 5/6.
4. Renfield. 90 enjoyably dumb and gory minutes. 4/6.
5. The Flash. Fun time at the movies, and I got to see good old Michael Keaton Batman on the big screen. 4/6.
6. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. I get to yet another old hero on the big screen. The third act is so beyond batshit insanity it knocks it up to 5/6.
7. Barbenheimer. Barbie: Nearly 2 straight hours of wacky laughs. 5/6. Oppenheimer (IMAX 70mm): Christopher Nolan manages to make a pretty exactly 3 hour long movie about the man behind the atomic bomb be 95% people sitting or standing talking about that... and it's somehow engaging. 5/6
9. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Utterly gorgeous visually, gripping story, and a shocking ending. 6/6.
10. A Haunting in Venice. An enjoyable, spooky murder mystery that's a perfectly good treat leading up to Halloween. Saw it with Dolby Atmos, and holy shit was that sound amazing. 4/6.
11. Killers of the Flower Moon. (I was fucking ecstatic seeing this on my birthday.) It's a heavy movie in both subject and runtime, and absolutely gut wrenching with the two leads acting their heart and soul out. It's almost hard to belive it's stuff that actually happened 100 years ago. 6/6.
12. There's Something in the Barn. An delightfully wacky alternative Christmas movie. It is a blast. Definitely one for the future rewatches during Christmas. 5/6.",Comic_Book_Reader,,2,2,2023-12-31 17:57:03

Unfortunately there were three things that really annoyed me. 
1. Cuthberts injury. We really can not afford to lose her to a long-term injury. Such an important player for us. 
2. Really sloppy plays out from the back. We really could not handle any kind of pressure and if we gave away the ball as much against a better, more lethal team, we would be thrashed. Obviously this could be down to it being the first game, but still.
3. The inability to know the players names! How you can make ""Kaneryd"" into ""Canaird"" is beyond me. And when they didn't confuse Bernabe with Perisset, they called her some weird thing, so I didn't even know about whom they were talking. There were atleast one more name they got clearly wrong. 
I know it's ""just"" a preseason game, but surely we could expect some effort in learning the names?

lig9ol3,t3_1etq4ts,"BRILLIANT!!!! I‚Äôve been waiting for someone to put all of this together, thank you! Regardless of opinions on Matty, he definitely played a role in this. He‚Äôs been doing irony and performance art for yeeeears so he would be a perfect candidate. Much of The 1975‚Äôs music comments on celebrity idolization, relationship with fame, and parasocial relationships. I do wonder how many actors there really are in this. I believe there are MANY people in on it and playing a part in order to expose and change the industry, as well as pointing out the fact that we really don‚Äôt know celebrities‚Äô personal lives. It‚Äôs all manufactured. I also think she tried to do this before perhaps with Tom Hiddleston (I‚ù§Ô∏èTS) or Lover. I don‚Äôt think fans caught on to the tongue-in-cheek of it all, so she‚Äôs going even more over the top this time, really spelling it out for us (spelling is fun!). I also think this may be the purpose behind all the chart blocking. To point out the many flaws of the system. At least, this is what I hope her motive is. In preparation to blow up TS the brand, the facade. It‚Äôs absolutely fascinating and would love a documentary on it all. It‚Äôs cabaret, it‚Äôs a show within a show. Another lyric: she says ‚Äúwho‚Äôs gonna troll you?‚Äù at the end of TTPD track. The whole thing is fucking metal

lif3b93,t3_1etq4ts,"Thank you so much for posting this (and referencing [my performanceartlor post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1dn24ke/the_case_for_performanceartlor_are_you_not/) -- I worked hard on it!); there are so many theories flying around that I have been thinking recently that we really needed a performanceartlor masterpost pulling together everyone else's theories. And then, for your first post, you went ahead and collated one! It's really a tremendous achievement and you should be very proud.

I want to comment on one thing you said; my opinion here is because of Taylor; it's not a critique of anything you wrote. But this idea sparked something for me:

>And of course, Gaylors had an entire Pride Month Surprise Songs Special. She is not letting one narrative stay consistent, but convoluting it all just to troll us‚Äî it‚Äôs her way of saying she knows exactly what‚Äôs going on in this fandom.¬†

>We as fans and the general public are the audience¬†**and**¬†the actors, which makes this performance piece a little more complicated. If this is the case, then how would we know if we‚Äôre part of the performance if it is not revealed to us?¬†

I agree that she has to reveal that there is a performance going on for it to be real and to matter. But I often worry about what form it will take. She has all the control here. Because of how she has used queer history to express herself, she now has an outsized influence over how queer history, culture and flagging are consumed by the press and a new generation of queer people.  She could very easily, in an attempt to ""prove"" that we're all ""guilty,"" hurt LGBTQ culture and community in a time when we are still persecuted and in need of visibility.

So if/when she does reveal the man behind the curtain, I hope she does right by those of us whose symbols and history she's wrapped up into her billion dollar business. By casting us as ""shippers"" or ""invasive speculators"" in this reveal, she would perpetuate the oh-so-harmful ""don't speculate"" discourse in order to protect herself. She might think that's the right thing to do -- because of her class position or her race and gender or her political views -- but it would run countercurrent to what our society needs at this time.

I really hope she's thought about the consequences of this for people who are not her. I'm not entirely convinced she has. But maybe -- hopefully -- she'll prove me wrong. Great post again, OP, I hope we'll see more of you around here!!",MaterialTangelo9856,,33,33,2024-08-16 15:22:27

Speaking my truth? 

I hope she burns it all down and is able to live openly and freely outside of the performance art. I know that's easier said than done because who knows what would happen with the fandom if this were all true/revealed, and this is her career. 

I think about how my wife and I have a small business and how hard we've worked to build it to what it is and every time I post a piece of content I can't help but wonder- will they still love us if they don't agree? Will they hate us for being queer? Will we end up on a Reddit bash thread?

It‚Äôs about reconciling with an ex. And ‚Äúhe jokes that it‚Äôs heroin, but this time with an ‚Äòe‚Äô‚Äù. Healy was a heroin addict, now recovered.

But again, many of her songs often reference more than one relationship/situationship at a time, so who knows? 

She is a genius at keeping us guessing, that is for sure.

It might be helpful to find an integrative dr near you that deals with long Covid or ME.

mbnumd0,t3_1ij75ij,"Yep been going through this for 5 years, just found out it‚Äôs due to Covid wiping out are thiamine (b1) status. Here‚Äôs the explanation, I‚Äôm finally having massive relief from my lingering symptoms even though 2 yrs of carnivore diet with occasional citrus fruit got me 99% healed. Look into work by Dr. Derrick Lonsdale and his successor, Elliot Overton from EO Nutrition. https://youtu.be/K4iAPfAFcs0?si=yuPyXSfckVP-whAQ Elliot has many videos on yt explaining everything. Based on your specific symptoms (more neurological) you‚Äôd benefit more from TTFD form of thiamine, the product is called Thiamax. 

High-dose thiamine (vitamin B1) is being explored as a potential therapy for Long COVID due to its role in energy metabolism, nervous system function, and mitochondrial health. Here‚Äôs how it may help:

1. Restoring Energy Production (ATP)
	‚Ä¢	Thiamine is essential for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and Krebs cycle, which generate ATP (cellular energy).
	‚Ä¢	Long COVID has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to fatigue.
	‚Ä¢	High-dose thiamine bypasses deficiencies and supports ATP production, reducing fatigue.

2. Reducing Neurological Symptoms
	‚Ä¢	Thiamine is critical for nerve function and myelin production.
	‚Ä¢	Deficiency or functional deficiency can cause brain fog, numbness, dizziness, and autonomic dysfunction‚Äîsymptoms common in Long COVID.
	‚Ä¢	High doses improve neurotransmitter function and nerve conduction.

3. Counteracting Oxidative Stress & Inflammation
	‚Ä¢	Long COVID is associated with chronic inflammation and oxidative stress.
	‚Ä¢	Thiamine acts as an antioxidant, reducing glutamate excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation.

4. Supporting the Autonomic Nervous System (Dysautonomia & POTS)
	‚Ä¢	Many Long COVID patients develop dysautonomia (dysregulated heart rate, blood pressure, digestion).
	‚Ä¢	Thiamine improves vagus nerve function and blood flow regulation, helping with POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome).

5. Improving Blood Flow & Oxygenation
	‚Ä¢	Thiamine deficiency leads to lactic acidosis, impairing oxygen use.
	‚Ä¢	High doses restore oxygen metabolism, reducing symptoms like breathlessness and exercise intolerance.

6. Addressing Nutrient Deficiencies & Gut Dysfunction
	‚Ä¢	Long COVID may impair gut function and nutrient absorption.
	‚Ä¢	High-dose thiamine helps repair the gut-brain axis and supports gut motility (vagus nerve activation).

Dosing Considerations
	‚Ä¢	Standard doses (1-5 mg) may not be effective for functional thiamine deficiency.
	‚Ä¢	High doses (50-1500 mg) of thiamine HCl or TTFD (lipid-soluble thiamine) are often used in studies.
	‚Ä¢	Magnesium, B2, and other cofactors enhance absorption.

Some Long COVID patients report rapid improvements in fatigue, brain fog, and autonomic symptoms with high-dose thiamine, but responses vary. It‚Äôs best to start low and increase gradually to assess tolerance.

Also, read the comments on Elliot‚Äôs videos, it‚Äôs wild how many people he‚Äôs helped get over long covid. You‚Äôll literally feel yourself healing almost immediately when you begin taking the bio-available thiamine, traditional thiamine (thiamine hydrochloride) is not effective for this you need either the TTFD or benfotiamine. Take extra magnesium and potassium with it.",Puzzled_Draw4820,,1,1,2025-02-08 14:26:16

mbd1j1c,t3_1ij7dwn,"Yeah, a whole lot of pre-syncope episodes just like you're describing. Dysautonomia. Believe it. Took me probably 6 months before I actually accepted it. Biggest thing that helped in the early going with that was the electrolyte supplements (Vitassium) and Beta Blocker (Bisoprolol.) You really need to be careful with the pre-syncope thing - testing will be normal and the docs will tell you you're a OK and then you get in a car and drive 75 on the highway and almost black out and kill your whole family and some other poor family or two or three... 

The food thing is a huge trigger. That's because of the amount of blood that is drawn to the gut when you eat a large meal. You'll need to re-learn eating. That was hard for me, because I could eat like a horse from my very high activity lifestyle prior to infection. That blood being drawn there causes you to lose blood from your heart and brain which is why you feel dizzy and tired and winded. 

See if you can get a tilt-table test, which is what finally cracked the case for me, and caused the doctors to take me seriously and stop saying I was having panic attacks or anxiety. Electrophysiologist is the one most likely to know what that is and be able to do the test. A little hard to find, most likely a university hospital is your best bet. Try the vitassium (large doses daily) and maybe try a cardio who could get you the beta blocker. Sorry man. This is brutal. Been there over two years myself.",SpaceXCoyote,,5,5,2025-02-06 21:05:30

For most of the comparable stuff I had, H1 blocker seemed to be it for me (liquid Reactine - Cetirizine). 

The fainting, is it accompanied by a heart rate spike and mainly limited to just after standing, sometimes food and exertion? I needed Boswellia to help with the fainting feeling, seeing red, head burning and having to sit right back down.

I‚Äôve taken a single 500 mg dose of quercetin (said to block H1 also) so far and I seem to respond better to it than cetirizine so far outside of more tingling.
I had constant brain fog which I described as memory loss to the point of going out of the room several times, forgetting why, and at the end of the day realizing I hadn‚Äôt eaten yet. Eventually the brain fog for the most part became following exertion and cetirizine seemed to help with that along with a lot of other stuff.

mbh7x2p,t3_1ij7dwn,"2 years LC after severe COVID ICU admission

Here's a thought:  we know that other viruses such as EBV can trigger a ME/CFS state

Before the COVID pandemic, I suffered severe abdominal pain and CFS symptoms.  I was determined to beat it.  I found an expert in enterovirus who first recognized that this virus can drive CFS.  After multiple tests, colon surgery, and attempted medication treatment, it didn't improve.  The diagnosis was made after stomach biopsies came back positive for enterovirus RNA.

There is no treatment that works long term for enterococcus.  Most doctors have never heard of the gastrointestinal enterococcus infections, much less about CFS.

I was about 2 years into the enterococcus illness with CFS and then almost died from COVID pneumonia in an ICU..  When I finally got home after about a month in the hospital, the enterococcus symptoms were gone.  It was probably a huge cytokine storm that killed the enterovirus. 

My point:  we can think its Long COVID but it could be another virus.  A positive COVID test for the acute infection is needed to officially diagnose Long COVID.  But your symptoms sound like Long COVID to me.",Itchy-Contest5087,,1,1,2025-02-07 13:56:10
mbhlqxt,t3_1ij7dwn,"I can relate - a lot of you are experiencing I‚Äôve been going through my self. When do you suspect you got infected with Covid? You would have felt sick like a flu or cold? In Long covid typically symptoms start 2-3 months post the original infection.

I was pretty healthy, working full-time, 4 kids and family, managed it all well. Positive covid September 2021, recovered and then boom Feb/march 2022 it all started: low grade fevers joint and musks pain nausea near fainting episodes dizziness insane bed bound fatigue brain fog mental slowness memory issues.¬†

By now I‚Äôve done a ton of tests over 3 years and have seen a ton of specialists. Perhaps any of this would give you some ideas of what you can explore next.

PCP - ordered a bunch of tests ultrasounds X-rays and mri and ct scans for symptomatic body parts and all were normal.¬†

General neurology - had carpel tunnel test and and lumber puncture and some sort of epilepsy test - all normal - had a trial of Amantadine, modafinil, Zoloft - all failed.

Rheumatologist - got positive ana marker (suspicion for autoimmune) but all further tests are negative - continue to see this provider still for fibromyalgia/post covid mialgia - went thru a bunch of med trials Lyrica lexapro gapabentin savella - took Cymbalta for a long time for pain but helped with anxiety too, gained a lot of weight I believe due to it, stopped it, lost weight

Cardiologist - got referral from pcp for a tilt table test to diagnose POTS - the tester said my test boderline because I also had high blood pressure increase along a huge increase in heart rate like maybe I had a panic attack (right‚Ä¶rolling my eyes)¬†

Neurologist who specializes in autonomic dysfunctions - for disautonomia and long covid. She prescribed me fludrocortisone for POTS (I‚Äôd say it helped some)band celebrex for pain. Together with naltrexone pain is still there every day with flare ups and all but when I stop these meds it gets worse.

I had a sleep study overnight and daytime - daytime is where they check if you have excessive sleepiness (I have insomnias, or I can sleep for 12-14+ hr ¬†like even 20hr..it happens). They diagnosed idiopathic hypersomnia or narcolepsy if I have cataplexy - dropping things which sometimes happens too).¬†

I saw a doc specializing in chronic fatigue syndrome - she diagnosed me with it.

I had 2 neuropsychological testing done - to confirm Brian fog - ¬†low scores on attention and memory.

I went to pain management centers Shirley Ryan ability lab in Chicago - eval by a physiatrist MD, tempted PT and met with health psychologist for 3-4 months. Struggled gong to these and couldn‚Äôt tolerate PT. Got wheeled out from one of the sessions as I collapsed.¬†

I went to ‚Äúcognitive rehab‚Äù speech therapist at Shirley Ryan - didn't help as i just can‚Äôt tolerate activity and the therapist kept telling me - ‚Äúyou just need to build endurance‚Äù one step at a time. Well when you sleep long hours and still wake up tired and stay tired and any activity could give you a crash (post exertion malaise) not sure how to build endurance‚Ä¶

I tried Stella the ganglion block shots - had 2 so far didn‚Äôt work but can‚Äôt move my neck well now after the last one (I guess they messed up smth)

The latest development - I got reinfected with Covid September 2024 and new sympoms appeared or intensified. I started having allergic reactions lips and face ¬†would swell after I eat foods I used to eat before and had nothing like this.¬†

My disautonomia Neuro suspected mast cell activation syndrome - found in long covid patients. Referred me to allergy and immunology doc - you gotta have a good one and she ended up to be one. She holistically looked at everything and ordered tests. My immunoglobulin M and E were positive; 24hr urine test came positive (used as a part of mast cell diagnosis). This doc also ordered genetic testing for anti-inflammatory diseases due to low grade fevers - haven‚Äôt done these yet.

Reading your symptoms going to allergy doc seems like a good step - talk about mast cell with this doc (I believe GI issues can be associated with mast cell activation) and check out POTS with tilt table test). For mast cell I take Zyrtec and Pepsis daily (it‚Äôs weird because I never had issues with allergies before except for here and there), I need to also add Allegra but haven‚Äôt done it yet. Doesn‚Äôt help me though but I keep taking and hoping it will do something.¬†

If you are nauseous ask PCP to give your meds for this - don‚Äôt have the name for it handy but o got it and it works.

I also get recurrent infections while basically not leaving home and it takes weeks to get through them - I ask for steroids from my rheumatologist sometimes to get out of these. Sometimes it helps.

I stopped working Jan 2023‚Ä¶and mostly live out of bed. Any activity mental or physical crashes me. My husband does basically everything and it sucks living this way - seeing a psychologist about 1-2 weeks too to help cope. Filed for disability with SSA in April of 2023 per the prognosis that my rheumatologist gave me - got denied, appealed and denied again, going to hearing in May (have an attorney) - I assume they won‚Äôt approve since I‚Äôm only 40, have MBA so should be able to adjust to other work. I don‚Äôt know how if I live out of bed with pain and other symptoms.

md3zx1s,t3_1ij7dwn,"Here's my whole story.¬† Hope you find something that helps you.‚ù§Ô∏è
My symptoms:¬† Covid attacked just about every system in my body and particularly those where I had weaknesses (which were previously under control).¬† I developed severe gastrointestinal problems: Gerd, reflux, low appetite, stomach ulcerations, impaired digestion, severe weight loss (140 down to 114).¬† Toxicity:¬† liver enzymes elevated, gall bladder pain and inflammation, strange coating on tongue.¬† Lungs:¬† shortness of breath.¬† Hormonal: some temporary female hormone imbalances, adrenal system totally wacko resulting in life threatening anxiety levels that I couldn't control mentally; Brain chemistry issues causing clinical depression, suicidal thoughts, inability to cope, frequent crying, emotional instability( so not like me, I didn't know who I was anymore), brain fog, processing difficulty.¬† Metabolic: high and low blood sugars; elevated blood pressure; chronic fatigue and PEM so bad I would get spells of feeling like I was dieing.¬† And I wished I could.¬† Now I'm glad I didn't and that I didn't try to end my life.¬† Other more minor: hair loss, vision disturbance, dizziness, muscle spasms, crawling skin sensations.¬† I was disabled, only able to minimally function 4 hours daily.
Effective Treatments and Supplements Discovered by Trial and Error:¬† Ionic Foot Baths got my liver enzymes back to normal and covid tongue resolved (A Major Difference company sells online, I received treatments at Functional Medicine Clinic Forum Health until buying my own). MgPro treatment restored my gall bladder¬† along with the foot baths.¬† IV Ozone therapy boosted white blood cell count and immune factors into normal (better than pre covid levels).¬† Nueroscope treatments helped balance brain waves, calm adrenal system and help me eat. (I bought the machine to be able to use daily at home), IV hydration with immune boosting vitamins plus magnesium, b complex and Taurine did wonders to calm anxiety.¬† Also got shots of magnesium and B12 weekly as needed.¬† The final treatment I used was shots of NAD once or twice monthly.¬† Total game changer that brought me out of long covid.¬† Specific results were brain fog lifted, could think and communicate clearly, anxiety decreased, energy increased.¬† Started feeling and acting like me again.
Exercise and being outdoors in the sunshine were crucial.¬† Walking and especially swimming were best for me.¬† Very helpful in combatting adrenal crash and anxiety.¬† Had to pace myself carefully and listen to my body to try to avoid PEM.
Medicine (I avoid drugs, but in this case I realized I would have to give in temporarily for crisis intervention.)¬† I took low doses of lorazepam once or twice daily and Lexapro daily.
Excellent, carefully planned diet and supplementation.¬† Mitopure by Time Line was crucial in the rebuilding of my mitochondrial system. (Covid seems to devastate mitochondrial function, accounting for the CFS and PEM and all the other bizzare malfunctions. If enough mitochondria are destroyed, a person dies.) Feeding my spirit with God's word, listening to healing scriptures, having friends pray over me and believe for me when my faith and trust was failing, quoting Scripture promises to myself and praising God even when I absolutely did not feel like doing so, screaming and sobbing my anguish and desperation out to God with unfettered honesty...all those things were the lifeline that kept me going, the anchor that kept me from giving up and losing myself. I HATE suffering, but I have to admit that God has shown me and done things in me that wouldn't have been possible otherwise.¬† I am praying for your full recovery and that you come out of this knowing the God who loves you like never before.¬† John 3:16, John17:3, Isaiah 58:8",ResidentAir4060,,1,1,2025-02-16 18:18:12

His achievements for his age actually count to his favour regardless of how he ran those rounds, and this goes for Kishane too. His physical development is also behind that of Noah and Kishane. When you put into perspective how he ran that 9.81 in the semi-final and the fact that he's now beaten Noah twice while not really trying at the end of both races, I don't think you can say he's a tier below those two. He's already opened his season in Jamaica and lowered his 400m PB from 47.48 to 47.04 and has been hitting the gym.

Akeem Blake also just won his first Diamond league, has a PB of 9.89 and is a whole year younger than Oblique and Kishane. I think age and experience should factor more when it comes to projecting TF improvement like it does for example with NBA scouting cause its not like Noah is competing against his peers. He's a few years older and has significantly more experience and you can see how that came to play in the final when they had to wait so long for the race to start.",Safe-Winter4557,,6,6,2025-02-23 15:01:41

Kishane seems to get injured a lot so while he had the world lead last year & is the Olympic Silver medalist there is a decent chance he gets an injury at some point & isn't at peak fitness come September.

I really hope Simbine can get a medal. He's been the most consistent 100m sprinter of the last decade honestly. He doesn't even choke either, he runs near his PB & last year even ran a PB/National Record in the final & somehow didn't get a medal with a 9.82.

Also I think Knighton's closer to the rest of the field than he is the top 3 right now. He's only 21 so plenty of time for him to bounce back, but he hasn't looked like himself for a while.

However Noah is typically fantastic and timing his season and knowing when to call it. Tebogo on the other hand has a lot of options. He could focus on 100, 200 or 400 and I would expect you‚Äôll never get you best 100 and 400 at the same time. I also suspect he is partial to peaking early, or overtraining. He was injured in his final race of the 2023 season, and was in world record shape by Feb last year and maintained it all the way through until the diamond league final where he underperformed compared to his previous running. 

I expect Noah will be at his best come worlds but will struggle to double. We‚Äôll see where his efforts lie this year. While Tebogo I‚Äôm worried may try to do everything at detriment to himself",bigfatpup,,2,2,2025-02-25 10:29:19

Having said that, there‚Äôs one really, *REALLY* glaring omission:

*The Road Warrior*, aka *Mad Max 2*.  As much as I love *Fury Road*, the fact is that Miller IMHO did it better -both on a lower budget and without the use of CGI- in *The Road Warrior*.

Gotta mention Point Break (1991) Car (+ Foot) chase. Director Kathryn Bigelow took inspiration from To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). Combined Car + Foot, it's still the best. And the Audio from the car chase would probably be ranked #1 of all listed in the article because it captures outside background sounds that enhance the realism. You don't just see hupcaps flying off, you hear them as well. So many little background aspects of the chase are immaculately captured in the audio. Drifting like its Tokyo Drift before Tokyo Drift was a thing. So refreshing that they had the actual car sounds dubbed in rather than stock footage. Even the Chevy starter on the Caprice....they actually overheated it and made it sieze....great attention to detail that you simply don't see in most movies. Grinding metal from impacts. A fucking gas station fireball explosion!

The shots, the editing, the use of sound, the stunts, and the actors of course. The 90s had this special flair, style, personality, music, bravado, simply amazing!

Do you think there would, there could, be as good a wordscape art piece painting of a car chase scene? Yeah, I don't think so.

>""The other guy yells 'Freeeze. . .' again and the car squeals off. He's there holding the gun dead straight in front of his face, peow, peow, peow, peow."" So reads a minute portion of Banner's jam-packed, monumental print, which recounts‚Äîin the artist's own words‚Äîan extended car‚Äìchase scene in the cult action film Point Break (1991). Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the film details the adrenaline-charged lifestyle of a gang of surfing bank robbers.

That's best in class touch for cinema audio, in the same way Sergio Leone recorded over the top bullet sound effects in For A Few Dollars More in a quarry. Each seemed to be fired/recorded in an echo chamber, and every shot was a ricochet! Bang! Zoom!

Back when movies did real stunts, no bullshit green screen and c.g.i.  Also a time when the actors were either actually driving or pulled by a camera truck.  It's much more exciting to watch knowing stunt drivers and the crew risked their lives to perform real stunts on real city streets.  Plus, it's just intense and thrilling to watch rather than seeing computer effects that suck the joy out of it knowing they're not actually doing any of the stunts.  Even to this day a lot of green screen or c.g.i. car chases still look fake, it hasn't improved all that much!

And to go along with it you have the best script dialogue in the history of film. Casablanca (1942) is ranked #2. ‚ÄúUtah, get me two.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so hungry I could eat the ass end of a dead Rhino.

kgm3ez9,t3_18z6z6l,"Thank you for sharing this, you wrote so much that resonates with me. I feel the only way out of this mess is to reclaim the senses. Of course we need to feel safe enough, to even consider being present and feeling the sensual gift of embodiment! Clearing the toxic influences helps the body awaken. Everything we consume and interact with needs to be taken into consideration. (From your body lotion to the way your coffee was made, to where you give your attention to) The act of sensing can be overwhelming, sharp and painful when awake. But that‚Äôs how we then learn our sacred boundaries, that time away from artificial light and overstimulation serves us, that ideas and programs cannot be inserted into us without consent. We remember the stillness and safety from choosing it. Just like sleeping in your mothers arms as an infant as safe, we need to identify and choose what serves our evolution. Only then when we feel safe, we can explore the intimate relationship we have with everything around us. We can find solutions together. The universe is making love with itself and we are all a part of the story. What we feel inside is outside. It‚Äôs up to us how we participate. If you asked anyone that NYE night, if they would make love with there phone (the actual person placed behind the phone) instead of their partner I bet most would say no. Or if they were to bring a small child to the event, would they disassociate themselves in the same ways, setting that as an example? Most of us need a reminder. We need to see that every conscious act and unconscious thought is cosmic union happening. Practice. Practice felling safe. Practice remembering your innocence and power. Feeling love. Feeling anything. Practice silence and tech free time. We are the ultimate technology fueled by love.",Glittering_33,,2,2,2024-01-06 18:14:12

kfp8iyq,t3_18v8gy5,"""Frequent Chelsea nemesis Beth Mead"" made me chuckle. Im a huge Mead fan. It's sad to see her okay for the gunners. 

The arsenal match was overall poor. If I was someone else in champions league, I would be watching that on repeat and looking to recreate that exposure. Arsenal is good there is no doubt but we really rolled over and let them have it easily. 

Moving into the stalemate that was H√§cken, I don't feel much better. My head says it wasn't good enough and the fairy tale ending I want for Hayes isn't looking good. 

Things turned around in the second half of the month and I hope that's the Chelsea we get going into 2024. 

It doesn't shake my overall feeling - Chelsea plays brilliantly when they control the narrative. But when forced to come from behind they have trouble finding the magic.

As always, excellent write up. The season is so busy now and so many matches. These help me stay on top of it all. 

Cheers and happy New Year, Blues.",IndependentTaco,,3,3,2023-12-31 14:27:59

- Unlike Hollywood DJ, The Rock is known as one of the most selfless top stars in the history of the wrestling  business. He has never had an issue putting other people over and looking weak. Where as in Hollywood, action stars have to protect their tough guy/squeaky clean image, push for top billing, and gain as much political influence over studios and projects as humanly possible. 

- He may have been out of touch with how over Cody was, but he changed course immediately upon figuring it out. Never once has The Rock hesitated to turn heel when the situation calls for it.

le4aktg,t3_1e81qlg,"I prefer the Umberto Eco description of fascist characteristics. 

1. The cult of tradition. ‚ÄúOne has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.‚Äù

2. The rejection of modernism. ‚ÄúThe Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.‚Äù

3. The cult of action for action‚Äôs sake. ‚ÄúAction being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.‚Äù

4. Disagreement is treason. ‚ÄúThe critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.‚Äù

5. Fear of difference. ‚ÄúThe first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.‚Äù

6. Appeal to social frustration. ‚ÄúOne of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.‚Äù

7. The obsession with a plot. ‚ÄúThe followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.‚Äù

8. The humiliation by the wealth and force of their enemies. ‚ÄúBy a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.‚Äù

9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. ‚ÄúFor Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.‚Äù

10. Contempt for the weak. ‚ÄúElitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.‚Äù

11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. ‚ÄúIn Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.‚Äù

12. Machismo and weaponry. ‚ÄúMachismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.‚Äù

13. Selective populism. ‚ÄúThere is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.‚Äù

14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. ‚ÄúAll the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.‚Äù",p0megranate13,,1042,1042,2024-07-20 18:51:02

2. Fined millions for a scam university
3. tried to overturn election results and interfere in the lawful certification process and spread lies about the election in doing so
4. helped to incite his supporters with election lies and bogus claims leading to his supporters ransacking the nations capitol and causing congress to run in fear
5. impeached twice
6. found liable by unanimous juries for sex assault and defamation.
7. found liable for massive business fraud
8. convicted of 34 felonies related to trying to cover up cheating on his wife with a porn star, to avoid the public learning about it before an election

1. Are you saying that you believe the nation is NOT in decline? With rampant homelessness, crime, and inflation through the roof? The country IS in decline. 
2. The line used to designate this ‚Äúpurity‚Äù is citizen or non citizen. There are people here ILLEGALLY. He‚Äôs not singling out a certain race of people, he‚Äôs separating them by legal status, that is a basic protection of the country that should have been provided it‚Äôs citizens. 
3. That‚Äôs the point of claiming election fraud is that he can‚Äôt prove it. The democrats were better at deceiving the public than he is of uncovering it apparently. Are you saying there was zero election fraud? I have heard of several cases where election fraud was sustained. Would it have overturned the election? No, however just because he can‚Äôt prove it doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt take place. And ultimately he conceded and left the White House. Nancy Pelosi still claims the election was ‚Äústolen‚Äù in 2016, so why isn‚Äôt she also a ‚Äúfascist‚Äù? 
4. What democratic liberties has Donald trump denied anyone? We are still to have an election, citizens can still vote. I‚Äôm not sure I understand the point you are trying to make with that one as all democratic processes are still intact. 
5. How many militarized group member do you think are for trump? Does antifa not count as a militarized group for the democrats? There are easily as many antifa members as any ‚Äúfar right‚Äù wing members for trump. The VAST majority of trump supporters cannot be considered far right, so to insinuate that trump supporters are far right is a fallacy. 
6. J6 was instigated by federal provocateurs. The fact that you left this bit out as well as security for the capitol that day fell under democratic supervision says a lot. You are denying even the possibility that this was a staged event perpetrated by the left, instigated by the fbi and understaffed by the democrats who knew what to expect. It certainly was not ‚Äúled by trump‚Äù as you suggest who said peacefully protest at the capitol. 
7. How can you insist trump rhetoric is insinuating violence without at least acknowledging the lefts equally insinuating rhetoric? It‚Äôs not like the left are fucking angels and trump words stand out, both sides are guilty of underhanded violet sentiment, with president Biden himself saying we need to put trump in the crosshairs days before an attempt was made on the presidents life. That seems a little more direct toward violence if you ask me. 
Trump is not a fascist, and based on all the things I just pointed out, you have sifted through the evidence and coincidentally omitted items that show you have made a desperate bid to try to prove a fallacy.

le6rnwj,t3_1e81qlg,"Describing whether or not Donald Trump is a fascist involves examining the characteristics of fascism and comparing them to his actions and policies. Fascism, historically defined, includes elements such as authoritarianism, extreme nationalism, suppression of dissent, and a desire for a homogenous society often characterized by dictatorial power.

1. **Elections and Democracy**: Trump participated in democratic elections, both winning and losing. He did not abolish elections or attempt to establish a single-party state.

2. **Free Press**: While Trump has often criticized the media and labeled it as ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù there was no systematic government censorship or elimination of press freedom as seen in fascist regimes.

3. **Political Opposition**: Opposition parties and figures remained active and vocal during Trump‚Äôs presidency. Despite his confrontations with opponents, the political system continued to function with checks and balances.

4. **Rule of Law**: The judiciary operated independently during his tenure. Various court rulings, even those unfavorable to Trump, were respected in practice.

5. **Military and Paramilitary Forces**: Trump did not create or use private militias to enforce his will, a common trait in fascist regimes. The military remained under civilian control and did not engage in political repression.

These points suggest that, while Trump exhibited authoritarian tendencies and controversial rhetoric, many of the defining characteristics of fascism were not fully realized during his presidency.",HellaCoolGuy1,,2,2,2024-07-21 05:27:50

Note that racism and anti-left Violence is not included in this definition when perhaps it should be. 

This is what I learnt from my history lecturer on Fascism: 

It explicitly glorifies the nation above all other. There is no universal Fascism, as it is bound specifically to the idea of national rebirth. Therefore it is tied to specific countries. 

In the Nazi case it is also racial in principle. Fascism is overly particularist/exclusionist in contrast to Communism which is universalist.",fartbumheadface,,2,2,2024-07-21 11:55:32

Fascism was never defeated in the United States; it went into hiding because it was too far behind Italy and Germany to be in a position to gain position in government, just like the UK.

I think fascists have put their ideology onto Trump, and because he's such a malleable force in politics, he's willing to repeat the lines, and push the agenda, because all he wants is the love of the crowd.

These are twenty lessons from the twentieth century I published seven years ago, first as a kind of online declaration, and then, with historical examples, in a pamphlet called On Tyranny.

They were written in advance of the first Trump presidency, and have been used since in the U.S. and around the world.

For those who want democracy and the rule of law in the United States after 2024, I would only add: now is the time to organize, to prepare to win locally and nationally, and to talk not only about what is to be lost but what can be gained.

I wrote On Tyranny in a defensive mode; but freedom is something not only to be defended but to be defined and to be celebrated. As for me, I believe that if we can get through the next year, things could get better. Much better.

For now, three years after Trump‚Äôs attempt to end democracy and the rule of law in the United States, a reminder of the lessons. I recall them now in then hope that I won‚Äôt have to do so again a year from now.

1. Do not obey in advance.  Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked.  A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do. 

2.  Defend institutions.  It is institutions that help us to preserve decency.  They need our help as well.  Do not speak of ‚Äúour institutions‚Äù unless you make them yours by acting on their behalf.  Institutions do not protect themselves.  They fall one after the other unless each is defended from the beginning.  So choose an institution you care about ‚Äî a court, a newspaper, a law, a labor union ‚Äî and take its side.

3. Beware the one-party state.  The parties that remade states and suppressed rivals were not omnipotent from the start.  They exploited a historic moment to make political life impossible for their opponents.  So support the multiple-party system and defend the rules of democratic elections.  Vote in local and state elections while you can.  Consider running for office.

4. Take responsibility for the face of the world.  The symbols of today enable the reality of tomorrow.  Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate.  Do not look away, and do not get used to them.  Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.

5. Remember professional ethics.  When political leaders set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become more important. It is hard to subvert a rule-of-law state without lawyers, or to hold show trials without judges.  Authoritarians need obedient civil servants, and concentration camp directors seek businessmen interested in cheap labor.

6. Be wary of paramilitaries.  When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching with torches and pictures of a leader, the end is nigh.  When the pro-leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the end has come.

7. Be reflective if you must be armed.  If you carry a weapon in public service, may God bless you and keep you.  But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things.  Be ready to say no.

8. Stand out.  Someone has to.  It is easy to follow along.  It can feel strange to do or say something different.  But without that unease, there is no freedom.  Remember Rosa Parks.  The moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.

9. Be kind to our language.  Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does.  Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying.  Make an effort to separate yourself from the internet.  Read books.

10. Believe in truth.  To abandon facts is to abandon freedom.  If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so.  If nothing is true, then all is spectacle.  The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.


11. Investigate.  Figure things out for yourself.  Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media.  Realize that some of what is on the internet is there to harm you.  Learn about sites that investigate propaganda campaigns (some of which come from abroad).  Take responsibility for what you communicate with others.

12. Make eye contact and small talk.  This is not just polite.  It is part of being a citizen and a responsible member of society.  It is also a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down social barriers, and understand whom you should and should not trust.  If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.

13. Practice corporeal politics.  Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen.  Get outside.  Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people.  Make new friends and march with them.

14. Establish a private life.  Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around.  Scrub your computer of malware on a regular basis.  Remember that email is skywriting.  Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less.  Have personal exchanges in person.  For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble.  Tyrants seek the hook on which to hang you.  Try not to have hooks.

15. Contribute to good causes.  Be active in organizations, political or not, that express your own view of life.  Pick a charity or two and set up autopay.  Then you will have made a free choice that supports civil society and helps others to do good.

16. Learn from peers in other countries.  Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends in other countries.  The present difficulties in the United States are an element of a larger trend.  And no country is going to find a solution by itself.  Make sure you and your family have passports.

17. Listen for dangerous words.  Be alert to use of the words ‚Äúextremism‚Äù and ‚Äúterrorism.‚Äù  Be alive to the fatal notions of ‚Äúemergency‚Äù and ‚Äúexception.‚Äù  Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.

18. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives.  Modern tyranny is terror management.  When the terrorist attack comes, remember that authoritarians exploit such events in order to consolidate power.  The sudden disaster that requires the end of checks and balances, the dissolution of opposition parties, the suspension of freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book.  Do not fall for it.

19. Be a patriot.  Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come.  They will need it.

20. Be as courageous as you can.  If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die under tyranny.",RockWallWinesSucks,,2,2,2024-07-21 16:44:26

leb1gfq,t3_1e81qlg,"Fascism is generally characterized by authoritarian nationalism, suppression of political opposition, control of the economy, aggressive militarism, and often includes xenophobia and racism. Here are some points that have led some to describe Donald Trump as exhibiting fascist tendencies:

1. **Authoritarianism**: Trump‚Äôs critics argue that his disdain for democratic norms, attacks on the press, and refusal to concede the 2020 election results suggest authoritarian inclinations.

2. **Nationalism and Populism**: His ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù rhetoric, emphasis on national sovereignty, and policies aimed at curbing immigration align with nationalist and populist ideologies.

3. **Suppression of Opposition**: Trump has frequently attacked political opponents, both verbally and through attempts to leverage legal and governmental powers.

4. **Militarism**: While Trump has not engaged in traditional aggressive militarism, his administration‚Äôs rhetoric and actions towards domestic protests, such as the use of federal forces against Black Lives Matter protesters, have been cited as concerning.

5. **Xenophobia and Racism**: Policies such as the travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries, family separations at the border, and inflammatory language about immigrants have been interpreted as xenophobic and racist.",pbutler6163,,2,2,2024-07-22 00:04:21

Trump isn't a fascist, or a racist. 

Republicans demanding voter ID isn't 'racist', nor is it 'fascist'.. Damn near every other country requires an ID to vote but somehow the U.S. is racist because it wants IDs to vote?

It's like you don't even do your own research - you just believe what other people tell you, then scream and cry and refuse to acknowledge facts when someone provides data you don't like that contradicts your position.

It'd be hilarious if it weren't so sad.

  
'Trump was sued because he didn't have enough black people in his apartments'.. Uh huh.. and how many applied? How many qualified? Having a 'black quota' sure sounds racist to me. With most situations involving large corporations, it's cheaper to roll your eyes and pay the fine then spend decades in court trying to fight it since the gov't has unlimited money and can drag cases on nearly indefinitely. This wasn't a criminal charge.

Ya'll ignore how many 'pillars of the black community' praised him for helping in the community but all the sudden he runs for President and he's 'racist'...   Trump along with Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali received the Ellis Island Award.... oh yeah, totally racist.

He wants national sovereignty and to not be invaded by foreign nationals, and somehow that makes him racist? But Japan not wanting foreigners is OK, because they're protecting their culture, right?

Damn near every bit of information is easily disproven, but your lives are so miserable that you have nothing to fight for so you find the first thing you can to fight against to make it seem like it's some huge struggle. When you stand for nothing you fall for anything.

The cases brought against him so far have all been BS. The lady that claimed she was raped is a nutjob, and her description of what supposedly happened was a blatant copy of an episode of a TV show -  a TV show she said she loved and was her favorite that she knew all the episodes to... how convenient.

The criminal charges are ... trumped up.... They turned possible misdemeanor charges into felony charges by falsifying complaints. It's like saying someone robbed a bank because they accidentally wrote a bad check, then charging them with 'being armed while committing a crime' because he had a pocket knife on him, and then adding 'armed robbery' to the charges.... It's all BS.

  
You don't have to believe me, the data and facts are there. Ask me a question without devolving to insults or logical fallacies, I dare you.",OldBayAllTheThings,,18,18,2024-07-20 19:31:29

lgpmgu4,t3_1el24zp,"Sad that the only time badminton, specifically Taiwanese badminton shows up on the front page is when Taiwan beats China. They did this last Olympics in Tokyo, beating a Chinese pair, and the comments were exactly the same as they are now. People use this as a crux against China to mock them. And to be fair there is plenty to make fun of and criticize. But it's fucking stupid because the sport is so much more than that. This might be the only medal Taiwan gets from Paris 2024. These guys were the defending champions and they repeated Olympic gold, something no other doubles pair has ever done before. And here we are but no one gives a shit about that. There's so much more to appreciate but the only time Reddit cares is when it can be used against China.

You don't ever see stories about other Taiwanese athletes when they lose to China in the finals or don't happen to beat China. It's essentially reducing their entire achievement to ""haha Taiwan beat China"" when there is so much more to it. These guys are making history and people should respect this match for that reason, not because they beat a Chinese pair along the way.",Emergency_Row,,2,2,2024-08-06 02:32:19

China government also recently started requesting anyone to use the internet to request a permit and ID so they can supervise and control the users and the government has the power to get in your id profile to look at what you are viewing . And yet they still tell their people Taiwan is part of China. All the athletes from China are paid by the government, the government recruiting and training and screening the youngster and starting to train them and pay for the poor family so they can use the youngster to compete , and if the athletes won any games, it will look good to the party/government and let the vest public feel proud and the athletes will feel "" grace "" from the government, but once the athletes are old or lose, they will feel a backlash from the public, and many of them after retired they can't find jobs because they use their life training,  and many of them turning baggers or homeless and have injuries and face a taught life .",One_Kaleidoscope_198,,1,1,2024-08-06 01:22:39

I don't know the answer to the above question because I've never played tennis at any level of competition.

As far as ""skidmarks"" go, the term she used was ""filthy underwear"". I used artistic license to leap to ""skidmarks"" because it's funnier to me.  The guy I picture her dumping me for (I'll call him ""Scot"" after the toilet tissue) is a swarthy gentleman with greasy jet black hair and a pencil moustache, gazing confusedly at the instructions on the back of a pack of Charmin. I don't know what he really looks like.  I don't want to know. As to what he's up to now, I have no idea.  I think he's probably with whatever special needs 23 year old he's convinced to take care of him, and poring over wirecutter dot com reviews for bidets.

My mom and my sister know that they're currently on my shitlist. I didn't make it clear in the post but they know now that bringing up Sarah to me again will have serious consequences on our relationship.  I think my sister just wanted to be able to spend time with me and sarah together as she said to me that she misses it. So do I.  I tried to convince her that the sarah she and I thought we knew no longer exists and maybe never did, but she isn't having any of it.  My mom treated sarah like a daughter and knew her from when she was born. I also know that there's been an uncomfortable rift between her and sarah's mom since Sarah brought home Captain Smellypants for holiday dinner. My mom just wants her best friend (Sarah's mom) back too. They'll just have to work it out for themselves.  Personally I think I did them a favor by not telling Sarah what I really thought of her.  That's as far as my charity goes.

As far as my version of small town (DRINK!) life goes.  I probably should have used a generic name like ""Bob's Drugs"" instead of ""independent drug store"".  I done been citified in my time away.  Yes there's a lunch counter.  The minister of the baptist church uses it as a way honing his barbecue skills and talking to people about ""BIG G"". The food is not great.  There's a reason I was only drinking coffee.  It wasn't fancy burned up city coffee, it was Folgiers. We have to drive an hour to get to the nearest Braum's.

If your small town (DRINK!) life differs from MY small town (DRINK!) life, then fine.  In my small town (DRINK!), when you take a shit, everyone knows what color it is.

6) ugly comes from within. As long as you have that weird, simmering anger towards Sarah, you‚Äôll stay ugly. It didn‚Äôt work out. You guys were so young. Maybe the youthful decision to marry was the mistake, not her leaving you. Whatever the case, you made the wrong decision that ended up with two incompatible people married TOGETHER. You‚Äôre both on this imperfect journey of life together, here on Earth at the same time. Why not let it go? You can be friends with her or not. Why the hate? It didn‚Äôt work out.

Mom and Sarah's mom knew how badly her former relationship and marriage went and OOP hadn't married again... thought they could get the two of them back together because Sarah knows how badly she stuffed up and how she still has 'boring' feelings for her ex husband (the OOP).

Good outcome.  OOP struggled with what happened and realised that once bitten, twice shy and he wouldn't put himself in that position to be hurt like that again by the same person.  Trust went out the window and you often don't get it back to the same level.  The couples that do stay together after infidelity will tell you the same thing.  It's never the same and there is always doubt there...

I'm sure the Olympic Games got in the way of many people who live in Paris and just generally altered the flow of the city, but what a great event this edition was. A lot of incredible things happened for the thousands of athletes, of course, but I was just mesmerised at how they integrated the entire city in the games and how, surprisingly, Paris became even more beautiful and alive.

Parisians are famous for being hated online and all, but if anything, I hope they at least recognise how one of a kind this spectacle is and that they're part of it. It's unlikely that other countries will be able to emulate it, so if they can find any positive in their city hosting the games, I hope they look at it with pride and enjoy it while it lasts. It will never happen again, so the people should take in as much of this event as they can and keep it dearly secured in their minds and hearts. I certainly would.

And while I'm speaking of them, I'd like to thank all French people for being so passionate and supportive to not only their athletes, but for other countries as well.

liiksw6,t3_1eu61yj,"Paris was amazing, its sights are the envy of the world.

But let's be real, you aren't seeing them in 99% of what you actually watch during the Olympics. 

California has some iconic places though not in the style of mega-monuments or palaces so it will be less grand compared to Paris. On the bright side, Paris won't be able to match the natural scenery of southern California and LA. Stadiums and arenas in LA are also absurdly nice and feature very interesting architecture. I think the swimming events being held in a football stadium (one that cost like $10B to build) is going to be stunning. 

Regardless, it's not a competition. And in four years Paris will be an afterthought anyway, that's part of the beauty of the Olympics is that it feels almost brand new because it's only once in every four years (for summer/winter, not the both combined of course).",Glittering-Plenty553,,90,90,2024-08-17 03:49:08

I don't think people tend to pay much attention to how much the video production side of things matter, but this was just a ""tour de force"" in top notch video and audio production and obviously built on the skills obtained from many years of producing Tour de France (which in it self is somewhat of a masterpiece in tv-production). Besides that, somehow the producers succeeded in integrating the feeling of ""yes, we're competitors but this is also an 'us thing' about friendship and community in sports in general"" like we've never seen before. As viewers, we got to be part of a ""club"".

Looking forward to LA, I must say that this is just as full-circle to me, as it gets. As a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut so my mind as a young teen just exploded, when the LA 1984 games opened with ""astronauts"" flying in with jetpacks on their backs during the opening ceremony, so to see Tom Cruise take the games from Paris to LA now was just a true wow-experience to me.

IMHO, it should always be in cities like Paris, LA, London, Berlin, Tokyo, Sydney, etc.  Not because those cities are ""better"", but because the facilities and hotels already exist organically and don't have to be purpose built for games and then never used again.",Lakerdog1970,,3,3,2024-08-17 12:03:31

The assassin's creed outfits or costumes were lame, If anything I think it exposes that French style and sophistaion is merely a stereotype. The logo sucks why does it look like a woman with an edgy haircut? The iconography of each sport was confusing and hard to understand. The ""style"" of everything didn't gel together.

More problematic to me seems the  tone shift in a light-hearted direction compared with the previous three much more grounded games (Which admittedly it was present in other previous trailers as well)

Hopefully they didn't change too much so this doesn't backfire (I still have pictures of the main menu saying ""Dreadwolf"" so it's clearly a possibility).

In the pause menu, the top categories from left to right are: Map, Character, Companions, Skills, Collections

Weapons are to the top left of the character. Helmet slot has a visibility icon. To the far right is a mini skill tree. To the far left are damage and survival ratings. Above Rook's head in the character section is a bird, a deer, a serpent, and octopus, a beetle, a mask (I guess those are the skill tree paths), and your money. Under the actual skill tree section, the shape of the tree is a hexagon.

Unless what they show tomorrow is a serious quest in the game, the dialogue will be quippy and whedon-esque.¬†

Also it'll be abundantly clear that [this](https://youtu.be/UjwnO5vd6gI?si=Hf7IsCTRaKvZowbb) was real.

Easy first 9 or so years of school

Completely breaks apart when needing to study

Goes into burnout mode after failing without knowing what to do about his problems.

Desperately looks for ANYTHING other than doing the actual studying to get out of the hole he's dug for himself.

Gets a niche, outlandish idea (""what if... US college... scholarship... full ride..."")

Absolute and utter hyper focus where he's applying all of that pent up energy and ingenuity with no regard for anything other than the hyperfocus in question.

Is still burnt out and doesn't realise that even if his hyperfocus and get-fixed-quick-scheme works out it's not gonna solve anything.

Gets in, goes to the US and... is still burnt out, still undiagnosed and unmedicated, still can't study because of this.

So he starts it all over again.

Also needs extra money for ""drinks and some new electronics each month"" (partying and impulse purchases of expensive things).

And the job he gets is, again, something he's unable to properly focus on (hell, could have made a career in pr after that internship if he managed to apply himself during work hours).

Finally makes a super detailed post on Reddit about all of this due to guilt, being too focused on the confession and making sure his IP is safe to realize how obviously and easily identifiable his profile is going to be, again due to hyperfocus. 


I am NOT saying it's an excuse.

I am NOT saying that people with ADHD are broken or damned cheaters or lazy.

Cause it's already so difficult for us and we have to work twice as hard to get there. And even later in life for internships and jobs.

l2xsr5j,t3_1cm2wt7,"Ah ex-Soviet Russians‚Ä¶ many are lovely people but when they‚Äôre crazy they are all in on the crazy. 

If they lived through the latter part of the Soviet Union/Russia in the 1990s, they‚Äôve got many reasons to be nuts. One coworker, lovely (but moderately scary) woman, grew up in the 80s in the USSR, told stories about how her single mother got so sick from spoiled milk when she was 7 that she was shown where all the important docs were in case she died. As if that was a fun story - she brought it up while people were discussing oat milk vs soy. 

It was ~~allegedly~~ an absolute mess of a time when the only way you got access to anything was through who you knew (corruption and cronyism) and when the Soviet Union collapsed, the pre existing cronyist and favor-based economy became a straight up mafia economy. The folks probably owe the Scotts from back in the day, that‚Äôs why they feel it‚Äôs a matter of family honor worth disowning a child over. 

(Edit: yes not inviting close business partners/associates to a family wedding is an enormous faux pas culturally in this case, the Scotts would be offended to the point that it would be the end of the business partnership if the parents condoned it by attending. So yeah OP should have recognised that while the Scotts are awful, she was putting her parents in the position of having to choose between her and their business. Right or wrong (extremely wrong obviously), but with Russian parents who had very likely experienced at least some of the 90s, they were very unlikely to willingly choose financial ruin.personally I‚Äôm of the opinion that the trash (the parents) took themselves out, but this wasn‚Äôt actually a completely unforeseeable outcome. Sad for OP that she had to go through so much crap along the way.)

Also very patriarchal society, like seriously have a look at modern russias domestic violence rates. Hence, daughter being harassed by their family friend doesn‚Äôt matter to them.

OOP's parents likely thought that OOP would eventually change her mind (come to her senses) about getting married to her fiance, so THEY wouldn't have to be ""the bad guys!""  When the wedding planning proceeded, they started being abusive.

l2zhqek,t3_1cm2wt7,"My freshman year there was this whole extended family of Russians who came to our school.  I became friend with one of the guys I shared classes with.  When we‚Äôd wait for our rides after school but he wasn‚Äôt allowed to wait by me because I was a girl and all of the whole group were betrothed to those their parents felt wouldn‚Äôt dilute their blood. 
His mom walked in one day when we were studying in the library and she noticed a necklace and ring I was wearing the fact I had the same books open did she start quizzing me about my family.   I told a pretty version of the truth.  I told her the truth about my gymnastics training and how I spent summers training with Olympic coaches.  When she asked about my home i told her the backside of the road so all you saw was our acreage and our huge freshly painted barn and stalls instead of our old ass small farm house on the other side, I told her my father was a founding member of a company (I just failed to say he was an employee with a very tiny stake 6%  and that we were poor as hell because of my mother‚Äôs medical bills.) When asked about my grandparents I told her how my Pop was an award winning architect in Los Angeles (truth - I just didn‚Äôt mention the fact he lost everything when his wife robbed him blind including all the hidden gold - we told him not to let her take over finances and tell her where the gold was but he was too busy drawing and too trusting) and that my other grandfather owned oil rigs (I just didn‚Äôt mention that California came in and banned him from drilling and then stole the land and paid three cents to the dollar and no lawyer would take California on so he just threw his hands up and quit fighting.) 
She decided I was okay to study with.   He profusely thanked me because he said if she didn‚Äôt like me when he went home he‚Äôd be beat.  She told me not to get any ideas though because he was ‚Äúlike Russian royalty‚Äù and he couldn‚Äôt dilute his blood with the likes of an ‚Äúuncultured American girl.‚Äù  She even mentioned I was a ‚Äúpretty blonde girl but your green eyes are a genetic mistake.‚Äù 
When I went home and told my great grandmother she started cursing the woman in German.  My dad walked in, heard her cursing, and quickly walked out saying he was going to ride the horses and told me to come do my chores.  He said to me, ‚Äúwhat the hell did you tell her?! I haven‚Äôt heard her talk like that since my sister and I decided to take the truck for a joyride after a football game and drove into the ditch and knocked the power out because we were too busy trying to look cool.‚Äù 
My great grandmother decided to do school pick up for the next month hoping to see the woman.  I purposefully changed my pick up spot.  

The girls in that family were all pulled from school shortly after they started.  They were always dressed to the nines, had their long hair pristine.  They weren‚Äôt allowed to talk to anyone.  They were pulled after one of them decided to sneak out to go on a date with a football player.  They were all put on house arrest according to my friend.  He also said the guy she was betrothed to was coming early and her parents were going to sign the papers for her to be married before she was 18. They were afraid she‚Äôd lose her virginity and needed her to be pure.  I saw the girls at the mall on the next town over and they had five Russian dudes with them that surrounded them as they walked around.   Everyone was like wtf is this.  This was not some big city at the time.  It was freaking home of 4H, cowboys, rodeo, and everything country.  There there were these guys lol

>**Well, as a Watergate and FBI historian, four things stand out to me:**

>1) The idea the FBI launched a raid on a former president would have been approved and monitored at the highest level of the Justice Department; hard to even imagine how high the bar of probable cause must've been for the Bureau to initiate such a politically sensitive search....

>2) A search warrant means an independent federal judge ALSO signed off on the probable cause and, independently, believes evidence there was likely a crime committed AND that more evidence would be found at Mar-a-Lago. That's huge too.

>3) The fact the search apparently didn't leak until basically when word came from Donald Trump himself shows the FBI and the Justice Department conducted this search by the book and a high degree of integrity. No leaks? Impressive. Surely only a small team knew inside DOJ....

>4) Taken together, this is one of the most significant, sensitive, and politically explosive actions the US Justice Department and FBI has ever taken‚Äîone of a tiny handful of times it's ever investigated a president. 

>Bottom line: The FBI & DOJ must've known they had the goods.

Secondly, I hope you are aware that Trump and Epstein allegedly raped a 13 year old girl together, but that 13 year old (who was an adult by 2016), [got death threats from Trump supporters and likely dropped the lawsuit because of death threats from Trump supporters](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/donald-trump-teenage-rape-accusations-lawsuit-dropped).

I'm with everyone here about OOP very likely being unaware of some sort of deal involving her being sold/groomed to the Scotts, but I'd like to bring up another possible twist about it:


I think on the outside, the Scotts may want OOP married to their son and do some sort of family merge (which honestly sounds just like a business merge with extra steps) but the creepy behavior of the senior Scott it's definitely a red flag, and since it's kinda obvious they care about appearances, I think the arranged marriage is the main ""deal"" on the table, but senior Scott is probably thinking on OOP being of easy access to him as a DIL, and thus able to eventually coerce her into his sexual advances, he may have decided that later than the og deal, when OOP started to... um develop (excuse me while I vomit) or it may have been the plan all along since the beggining of his investment, either way, OOP was seen as nothing more than a bargaining chip.

It will hurt. You will want to go back because you‚Äôre thinking of the good times or you want to protect your brothers so to make up with them is best. 

I have felt those same things but I always remind myself that not once in the past 3 years I‚Äôve been with my wife have they respected a single decision I‚Äôve made. Not once did they acknowledge my pain and feelings. Not once did they listen. They just want what they want and will do anything to get it.
