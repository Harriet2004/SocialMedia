ldix9o1,t3_1e4sr43,"Wow I kinda dislike this post honestly.

The song is not what was used by the team during it competition so it throws out all the timing/coordination/training they did to go to the song they chose for the competition. 

Japan didn't get second place during this event, China did with Ukraine getting third. Just a straight up lie.

Only thing accurate in this is the visual video itself and the fact Russia won 1st in artistic swimming in Tokyo 2020.

I just want it to be known I don't support China or Russia, nor their governments. I just want the actual truth to be out there rather than some Tik Tok level video which is lying to people.",Supraultraplex,,32,32,2024-07-16 22:55:12

ldl7pxp,t3_1e4sr43,"So fun story. At my middle school they had this as a competitive activity for the girls during swim class (which was basically our phys ed class in hotter parts of the year). The girls and guys were separated at swim class, and the guys' focus was on stuff like improving technique for competitive swimming instead. This was mainly because the girls' swim instructor was an ex-competitive synchronized swimmer.

One year, a friend if mine says, ""Yo, why don't we get to do this?"" He goes and talks to the gym class teachers, and manages to get a group of the guys included as a wild card team in the final competition at the end of swim season. Someone manages to find some vide of professional synchronized swimming on a p2p network (there was no YouTube back then), we watch it and start practicing every day after school for a few weeks. We go in the day of the competition, do a bunch of backflips and shit, and win second place. One of my coolest memories from middle school.",,,2,2,2024-07-17 10:24:14

So for the sportmanship‚ they or he (quatar guy) decided to share",moccolo,,1,1,2024-02-04 11:35:12

For reference, the average income at that location was \~5k dollars per person a year. 

  
After the car accident, the government offered \~400 dollars a month for the family, which is apparently not enough for 5 kids.

Made with Python and Matplotlib, and a few text annotations in Preview

EDIT: Wow, this one really took off! Glad to see all the comments and feedback rolling in as the day has gone on from around the world.

I just want to make a quick point for the record - while I am an American and I was excited about the race, it really is only a sports competition to me. And that, in my view, is how it should be. I don't even think the gold medal race is all that important, since I think total medals and overall depth of a national team more accurately reflects aggregate ability. This position is a minority position around the world, as most countries rank by golds, and not total medals. This visualization caters to that audience more than to myself.

I must say that I don't really get the anger in either direction on this. The fact that the US got more golds, 39-38, is not a celebration or condemnation of any government, political system, or economic system. Calling this visualization ""CIA Propaganda"" is absurd, as is the racism that a few of the comments have shown towards the Chinese people. I've heard that certain subreddits have gone into full meltdowns over this, which again makes no sense since this is simply a statement of what happened.

I can't control what all (as of now) 38,000+ of you do, but please don't brigade other subreddits or harass people with this visualization. I'm just a happy American who enjoyed a well-competed Olympics. All other political and cultural considerations are irrelevant. Let's just try to enjoy a fun sporting event during an extremely difficult time for humanity.",teddyterminal,,1489,1489,2021-08-08 08:20:36

To not host the event now certainly means economical disaster for the city.

Even if the event doesn't draw in the millions, at least some money can be recouped.

I can't tell you how pleased I am to read many cities are now removing their names from the registry as to not fall into the same financial fiascos as many before it.

Please don't come.

The only way Japan will cancel the Olympics is if other countries bow out.

The same thing happened last year. The Japanese government and Olympic organizers were adamant that the games would go on. But when other countries said they weren't sending their athletes, they had to cave in and postpone things.

Having the Olympics this year is just as dangerous as last year. Having thousands of athletes coming to compete is very risky, and having thousands (or millions?) of tourists is just foolish.

Most Japanese people don't care if the Olympics happen or not. I have not talked to one person who thinks this is a good idea. The closest has been ""well, if they can do it in a way that guarantees everyone's safety...""

The organizers won't listen to reason. They have too much personal political stock in the games. To them, it's worth damaging a few hundred athletes and infecting a few thousand people. Please don't let them play their game.",Ken_Meredith,,10,10,2021-02-02 23:38:51

Japan has done practically nothing to combat the virus - it seems to be actively trying to suppress the numbers by refusing to test people. No one should come here. They aren't even asking people to self quarentine at customs and certainly aren't testing new arrivals for the virus. I have 3 different friends who have all the symptoms but were told by the doctors that they ""can't"" administer the test. The trains are still packed at rush hour. The parks are full of screaming children and restaurants are packed. Japanese work culture doesn't condone someone having a private office so telecommuting for most companies is completely off the table. Despite ""suggesting"" nationwide school closures at the beginning of March, they've decided that somehow the virus is defeated and everything can open up like normal in April.",drale2,,72,72,2020-03-23 09:28:49

Weightlifting was also *only* viewable online; and good luck trying to find the replay of that feed. We, NBC, hid it in Google and it’s embedded in a text article that you will *also* have to enter your cable provider to even access.

h69yinr,t3_opzmdx,"I appreciate that a decent number on redditors are politely praising and defending the shabby ceremony. Thing is, you really don't have to.

There already was an excellent ceremony planned, and apparently at about ""80% done"", but in December 2020 all of the creative committee was fired by Denstu (the agency in charge, which already had bribery scandal with IOC), and replaced by Mr Sasaki who had an idea for a ""subdued"" version. The claim at the time was to save money, but that seems bullshit since ""80%"" of the original was already ready. More likely, Denstu wanted to save money for itself.

In any case, Dentsu  puts together a group of corrupt assholes lead by Mr Sasaki that have gradually been fired and/or resigning from February up till yesterday for being mysogonists, bullies, etc, including Mr Sasaki himself in March.

So if the ceremony feels like it was put together by someone who's seen modern art, but does not actually have an ounce of artistic passion inside because he's a grifter in a suit, its because it probably was.

I want to emphasize that the individual performers and performances were talented, its just a shame they were let down by the incompetent and corrupt directors.

> Olympic medalists unveil the Tokyo Olympics medals during the One Year to Go Ceremony at Tokyo Forum in Tokyo, Japan, 24 July 2019.With the opening ceremony for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo exactly one year from Wednesday, the medals are one thing organizers won&#039;t need to worry about finishing in time.

> The Tokyo 2020 Medal Project sparked the collection of nearly 80,000 tons of mobile phones and small electronic devices around Japan, which will be used in the crafting of every gold, silver and bronze Olympic and Paralympic medal awarded to athletes at next year&#039;s games.

> Following a process of dismantling, extracting and refining, the metals will be fused into the brainchild of Olympic medal designer Junichi Kawanishi, who was granted the design opportunity after winning a competition held by Tokyo 2020 that drew over 400 entries.

[*This is the only Panel in the comic, however it is very tall. On the top there is a blue banner with*

 *written in it. Above the ""20"" there is another ""20"" so it could be read 2020 too. There are also the 5 Olympic circles drawn. Below the banner there is a pile of clays stacked on top of one another. The first one is United States, which is wearing sunglasses. We can find written next to it, to the left, ""1st in N.

Attached to it there is a radio that reaches down in front of Germany and Italy. The radio is playing at full volume part of a song, presumably ""Rule Britannia"", on loop. Next to Great Britain, on the left, ""1st in Europe"" can be read.*]

[*Below Great Britain there is a very big Russia, wearing a tiny completely white mask with ""ROC"" written on it. It has narrow eyes.*]

**Russia**: what a rossiya is never hear of it, does it be taste good

**Netherlands**: ouw squish too hard

[*Below Netherlands there is France, with narrow eyes.*]

**France**: voluer

[*Below France there is Germany, and below it there is Italy. They are both annoyed and tortured by the loud music coming out of Great Britain's radio. Italy is pointing a gun at itself.*]

**South Korea**: oh nanuen just feel great this olympic i dont of know why is like big heaby fat lousy noisy weight did not show they ugly face

[*Below South Korea there is a bigger Poland, holding a piece of paper. On the piece of paper there is something written, and it is shown behind it. The text is also partially covered by Poland, which looks happy.*]

>Tokyo 2020 Medals To Be Made From Discarded Smartphones And Laptops
All medals at next summer's Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo will be made from recycled electronic waste, including discarded smartphones, digital cameras and other handheld games and laptops, organizers revealed on Friday.

>Officials said they expect to collect enough obsolete electronic devices by the end of March to extract the amount of gold, silver and bronze that will be required to manufacture all the medals that will be awarded next year.

>The organizing committee said municipal authorities had already collected 47,488 tons of junked devices by November, roughly 19 months after the project was launched with targets of 30.3kg of gold, 4,100kg of silver and 2,700kg of bronze.

>The goal for bronze was reached in June, while more than 90% of the gold and 85% of the silver has been collected, officials said.

>""It is estimated that the remaining amounts of metal required to manufacture all Olympic and Paralympic medals can be extracted from the devices already donated,"" the organizers said in a statement.

>The concept has been implemented in previous Olympics, most recently at Rio 2016, where an estimated 30% of the silver and bronze medals were wrought from recycled materials.

>The designs for the Tokyo 2020 medals will be unveiled later this year.",ClearVanilla,,2,2,2019-04-15 12:05:06

39 golds is the lowest leading medal total since 2004 and 2000, both of which had far less events (339 this year, 301 in those years).

Im not going to manually do all the maths, but i suspect this Olympics has the lowest percentage of gold medals won by the leading nation ever at 11.5%.

h857dvs,t3_p09k7f,"Speaking personally as someone with a keen fondness of several of the sports on show today (\*internally dies at Kenny losing the Woman’s Omnium\*) and geopolitics, there is a certain irony in China’s ‘inevitable’ gold victory (per many comments in this subreddit from a few days ago) turning into a loss given Beijing’s tendency to push the idea of inevitability in many political and economic arenas.

That said, as someone with a Chinese wife who just recently became a British citizen and has been conflicted in their support through all the Olympics (bless ‘em they’ve genuinely had a hard time with it), it was a fantastic showing for China. Already their 2nd best gold showing ever, and on foreign soil. It’s also potentially their 2nd best overall foreign medal total ever. For all I’ve expressed plenty of political distain towards the PRC’s government in other subreddits over the years, the Chinese users on this subreddit should be proud of their country’s performance at this Olympics. They took the US right to the edge, the closest anyone has on foreign soul in decades. It’s a matter of when, no if China has its moment of overall foreign soil gold glory, and they should take pride in giving the historic dominator of gold a seriously tight run for its money. It was basically 50/50 until the last day, and the US won through luck as much as skill.

It’s been a fun Olympics, and props to Tokyo for hosting the events so well despite the horrendous circumstances. I’m a brit through and through, and damn did we do much better than I expected (woooooo!), but for I feel genuinely excited by the performance of everyone this year. Such a tight gold race, a record number of nations meddling, and especially Japan winning baseball gold. I have no idea how it became such a big sport in Japan but you winning the gold in it on home soil is the absolute peak moment of the Olympics for me you wonderful lads and lasses.

I may be supressing some deep rage about that 0.01s loss to Italy in the 4x100m, especially after the Euro finals, but let’s ignore that and pretend I’m totally zen right now.

Congratulations to the US delegation, taking home the most medals of each medal, solidifying their place at top of standing. 

China's performance was solid as ever, though their medal spread may be indicative of lack of depth in their rosters.

ROC athletes will be controversial for years to come, regardless put up a solid performance with reduced sport eligibility.

Japan definitely benefited from the host country bump and performed very well with some perhaps upset performances to push them toward the top of the standings. Some final performances on the last day pushed them clear of the challenge from the British athletes.

Great Britain and Australia round out the center of the top 10 with solid performances across the board. The UK almost had a perfect spread of 21-21-21, and the Aussies came out swinging way above their population would suggest.

Italy, Germany, and Netherlands were extremely competitive with each other in basically any scoring system. This one favors Italy just slightly above the other two which tie at 78 points in 8th place.

Rounding out the top 10 is perhaps a slightly under performing France who will be looking to Paris to raise up the ranks.",akatokuro,,5,5,2021-08-08 08:57:28

In addition to traditional strongholds like table tennis and badminton, Chinese officials deliberately targeted sports that were underfunded in the West, such as women’s sports, or less high-profile pursuits with many medals on offer from multiple weight divisions or event categories.""

Rewind a play and get a better view right on the field. Shortly after, 8k cameras will be standardized for this technology.

It really needs to get re adapted into an anime, as the manga could easily fill 2-3+ long seasons or 3-5~ movies. ",Musiclover4200,,14,14,2019-02-22 20:04:37

h7axnr5,t3_oph2ls,"I think the 'disaster' and 'nightmare' assessments of our overall performance at these Games are unfair. The support shown for the Irish team has been very positive, but maybe we should slightly adjust our expectations. We had less than ten realistic medal hopefuls and it looks like we'll end up with four medals, which is quite reasonable in my opinion. The margins between success and failure in the Olympics are so tight that it's almost reductive to look solely at the medal table.

Kurt Walker won the third round of his bout last night on four of the judges' scorecards. If the fifth judge had also given it in his favour, he would have been into a semi final and guaranteed at least a bronze medal. 

Rory McIlroy came within inches of a bronze medal. Had he holed his birdie putt on the last, he would have ended up on his own in third. Instead, it slipped agonisingly by and he would go on to suffer a cruel lip out in the play-off for bronze when there was just three of them left in it.

As Rhys said in his interview, one misplaced finger was all it took to put him slightly out of sync which then caused him to slip up. On another day he nails the routine and picks up a medal, though it was always going to be a tough ask for him to pull it off in his first Olympic final.

Seems like Ireland is aiming to improve its medal haul over the next few Olympics. A new High Performance Strategy has been laid out inspired by New Zealand, a country with a similar population size which went from a string of mediocre Olympic showings to becoming a medal powerhouse and regular top 10-20 nation. The trick, it seems, was not just funding, training, and equipment, but prioritizing sports based on both Olympic and non-Olympic success record, and the number of possible medal events in a sport. For New Zealand, this meant pouring money into stuff like rowing, sailing, cycling, and athletics and giving targetted attention to other sports where there was potential, while leaving underperforming sports like archery and table tennis out in the cold (NZ had regularly qualified athletes in those sports prior to Beijing, but they never did particularly well, so most of their funding was redirected to the others).

This is partly because CSM’s early chapters are… well, they’re fine, but they don’t really push the boundary like later chapters do.

So it’s possible that the underwhelming reception of season 1 just reflects the middling quality of the early chapters. Perhaps the studio mistakenly thought that the late chapter hype could translate into early chapter BD sales.

> For example streaming service might pay a base fee for each episode, and they may agree on a viewership count in which service will share a certain percent profits once the show pass that. Obviously these are all commercial secret so we have no knowledge of exact figures, but it generally follow this rule. 

We don't know how much was paid by streaming platforms, but based on how heavily it was promoted by Crunchyroll, it seems likely that this was bought at or near top dollar.

Especially considering that the voice actor for the ""Chainsaw Man"" collaboration was well received in Puzzle & Dragons, I feel that this is clearly a matter of the direction of the performance, etc., and is slightly different from criticism of the work itself.

I also think comparing anime still frames to manga panels is disingenuous (no slight at you still a really good piece). Anime is a time-based medium that relies on what lies in-between those still frames to make its point while manga is space-based. When you look at it that way, any look at CSM’s actual animation would change your stance. I haven’t seen many shows that look as consistently good in and out of motion as CSM does, and think it deserves praise for it.

I never thought I’d feel bad for a Shounen, but seeing CSM’s Blu-ray sales kinda sucks. When you’ve got a Demon Slayer compilation film printing money at the box office, it’s a tragedy to see CSM go down as one of the biggest disappointments in anime history.",Salty145,,115,115,2023-02-07 03:59:38

I don't think I have ever seen a manga adaptation that I feel matched the tone, themes, etc, of the source perfectly like people seem to be expecting. I also think adapting this manga is extremely difficult since its style and imagery were not really made for TV.

I distinctly remember from discussion forums (probably the same ones OP reads) that 3,000 copies was said to the mark where the studio starts making money, although this was like 6 years back and streaming wasn't as prevalent as now. I'm actually shocked CSM sold this little. Even with industry sales declining, that's a really low figure for a big title.

Even if the anime was well-received, they massively overestimated the audience by going for Tokyo Garden Theatre. Events like these aren't just targeted at the fans of the work but also the fans of the seiyuus. None of the seiyuus are super popular; the two girls may have their core fanbase at least but the guys are up and coming at best. The studio might have to eat losses due to the cost of booking the venue if they don't sell out, since venue costs are pretty massive in general and the profit is in the event merch bought by those who attend.",komasanzura,,10,10,2023-02-07 14:49:02

j7jahus,t3_10vhu85,"I mean, the BD disks were originally priced at 6800 yen which is about $US 50. Assuming that this 1st volume sold 20000 less than originally thought (this is around where JJK sold in 2021 so I think it’s appropriate), there are 4 BD volumes (3 episodes each) and that sales across all 4 volumes are constant (this is relatively usual if the anime is as big as CSM, smaller titles will usually sell less with later volumes, while special gifts can push things the other way round - or if you are Lycoris Recoil or Bocchi The Rock), MAPPA (and whatever company that shares the BD sales revenues - not sure if there are any in CSM’s special case) is losing 20000 x 4 x 50 = $US 4 million of potential income.

In whatever way you can spin it, any project of this scale that misses $4m of income is not something that you can sweep away easily.

And remember CSM has an unusually large advertising campaign. [Someone checked the prices of 4 billboards used in Shibuya and Shinjuku in Tokyo](https://twitter.com/nero_sense/status/1620404624288260096?s=61&t=NPYmYGGdoxTWyKM1qjSb6A) and the price (for 1 week IIRC) is 60.1 million yen = $US 455k. That’s just one tip of the iceberg, and that doesn’t even include international advertising (I’ve seen reports of actual billboards or posters from Hong Kong to California to Germany to Brazil; now Crunchyroll and other licensors pay for that but they will in turn adjust their bidding prices based on that).

It is possible for this project to come back with a profit, but one cannot deny that the potential golden goose from CSM have been slain by the Animating Devil. You may argue that MAPPA isn’t expecting that much sales of BDs as JJK or KNY, but one doesn’t rent such a large venue for a VA and ED singers meeting event & concert if they don’t expect those 2 events of 8000 seats are filled to the brim. And before people says “these are priority tickets, others without buying BDs can still come” - I am pretty sure most such events bundled with BDs are set up to be filled by lotteries, not having seats for others to come.

j7jkxov,t3_10vhu85,"I think the most important thing that's lacking in CSM's anime adaptation that you didn't mention is its **ACTION SCENES**.

While the best part of CSM is indeed in its character writing, to get people hooked to an action-shonen **you still need cool action scenes**. The manga achieved this amazingly through Fujimoto's gritty artstyle and memorable panels. The fight scenes feel appropriately brutal and raw there.

For the anime, while the character scenes are *absolutely fantastic* and I wouldn't change a thing,

**but the fights, they're a different story altogether...**

The only standout fight in the anime is Denji vs Leech and Aki vs Katana (Maybe Kishibe's too but that was short).

The rest of the anime's fight scenes ranges from ""serviceable"" to ""good"", and *that's the problem*.

Without that sakuga-fest ""hook"" like AoT, JJK, and Demon Slayer, people most likely won't be interested.

Just search for CSM fight clips on Youtube and you can see how almost none of the clips hit a million. It's *embarassingly low* for an action shonen.

My personal opinion of the anime's fight scenes is that they feel ""**too rigid**"", like they were too afraid to let loose or something. Even the 2D fights suffer from this to blend with the 3D CG.

I wish whoever becomes the director for the next seasons realize this. People got hooked on CSM because of the absolute bonkers action first, then they see how the series is much more than that later.

EDIT: For people thinking that the problem is the length of the fights themselves, **It's not**. Hell, the CSM manga is beloved by many *precisely* because it doesn't waste time on needless dialogue and expositions.

The problem is that these short fights have the extra baggage of needing to look **spectacular** to be memorable. While the anime's not bad, it just didn't take advantage of the animated medium enough to deliver that same energy.

Streaming license money is going down due to the near monopoly Sony got. According to the same source from ANN.

CSM Is banned in china so that's a big part of streaming money gone.

The marketing for Chainsaw man is one of the biggest if not the biggest of ALL TIME. Nothing got as close as the marketing it got. It got a full ame talk episode by episode 3 of the anime!

Not everyone who buys a disc is going to the event. So 160000 does not equal 16000 event goers.

We don't know how much Sony paid them sponsor wise or if they did the marketing alone or how much its total cost or how much they got from streaming. But keep these in mind.

j7if179,t3_10vhu85,"It is fascinating to me how people who seems to never follow BD Sales try to downplay how low CSMan BD sales is. Some feels like they are denying reality even.

Like ""oh they sell it through MAPPA store"", that the same excuse people had when Nichijou underperfom (Oh, people bought it through KyoAni store) and even with KyoAni store number (and re-release), Nichijou is still one of KyoAni least selling series.

Some people says that BD sales no longer relevant. Well, they won't release BD at all if that's the case and there are few anime that simply never release BD (Blue Reflection for example). Because it takes money to print BD and they have expectation on how much they are going to sell. It is not ""free money"".

But the most important thing about BD is that it is a sign of how well recieved the series is. For example, which one is more well received, Kimetsu no Yaiba or Citrus? You look at BD sales, and clearly one is far more well recieved than the others.

That is an extreme example, but there is a reason Anime Movie BD usually sold tens of thousands if not hundred of thousands copies. Anime Movies are usually made in a very high quality, and people like those movies and decide to appreciate it by buying the BD instead of just stream it through streaming service (though they most likely also stream them even after buying BD).

There are even series that goes all in with BD sales without streaming their anime, like Strike the Blood. If streaming is all the rage now and BD is no longer viable, this kind of series will not be viable to make.

I've been following BD sales for quite a while now, not in professional manner, but just as a hobby. I've seen many series with low sales number, so CSMan number surprised me, but it is not a really strange thing in my eye. I remember when Chinese viewer was puzzled why Kobayashi-san no Maid Dragon sell less BD than Kemono Friends.

So it mind boggling to me that when people look at this number, their response is to deny it (""oh, it is false number"" or ""oh, it is not the full number"") or to deny its implication (""bd sales is not important anymore anyway"" or ""CSMan is still profitable""), instead of investigating why the number is low (""the season has many outstanding anime so it has tough competition"" or ""maybe the anime doesn't satisfy its fan"" or something in that regard).",MarkS00N,,141,141,2023-02-07 00:38:22

Most memorable moment creative diference CSM anime was the extended Aki morning scene... man how riveting.

Here is some more context for others. The last sentence corresponds to OP's quote. (My translation, full disclosure that I am not fluent.)

""When it came time for Chainsawman to get an anime adaptation, of course I was trying to figure out how Chainsawman connects with what I want to accomplish personally.

Honestly, even if you want to quibble that the numbers are not that low, because of MAPPA Store or otherwise, you then need to consider on how much other's numbers must be revised then. Revising one sales number but not the other is not a great way to see the overall health comparison. 

The hate for the director is real though. Some japanese start saying this for anime that is clearly low-quality ""wish that Ryu Nakayama directed this instead lol"". What it means is that CSM is wasted on him and he should direct this low-quality production instead.

Being different is fine. Not being accurate is also fine. As long as it is fun. Clearly though, the ""fun"" in CSM is lost on the audiences. Some of the fun stated here like the reference to western films, are lost on the audiences, resulting it being either distracting, or its not contributing to anything. The former is dangerous because the most pissed-off will think that the director is just having fun for himself, resulting in the ""ego-stroking"" comment. Its not even that the production don't have money. It clearly have tons of it, but its used for ""unnecessary things"" like, having different music for each episodes, instead of maybe paying for hand-drawn animation for action scenes? Being lavish about it is also pissing people off, since it felt like the committee squanders it. For example of non-accurate adaptation that still sold truckloads of money, FSN Heaven's Feel are criticized by VN fans for being liberal about some of the details and scenes. It still sold tons of it.

Honestly though, japanese otakus are different. They don't do things like organized boycotts or petitions like western people did.

j7jl4rw,t3_10vhu85,"Chainsaw Man is proving to be a surprisingly controversial anime under all the hype. I was checking reviews on MAL a few days ago, and I was surprised to see that the top review for Chainsaw Man was negative and had a lot more likes than the top positive review. So it is not only the Japanese that disliked that anime, a lot of western anime fans did too.

Part of it is probably hype-backlash of course. Chainsaw Man was hyped as the best anime of all time before it even aired, and that set some expectations. A lot of people probably watched it not because they were actually interested in that kind of story, but just to see what the hype was about. But Chainsaw Man is basically a battle shonen aimed at fans of dark and edgy horror movies and black comedy, and this is not the kind of things the general public usually like (battle shonen are popular, but horror movies and black comedy are usually rather niche) so a lot of people were probably disappointed by Chainsaw Man just because it was not to their tastes.

But those BD sales show that the anime was a dud even among the hardcore fans of the Chainsaw Man manga. It did well on streaming, so they still watched it, but did not liked it enough to buy the BD - something quite surprising for such a large and rabid fanbase. And the new cinematographic approach from the director did not attract enough new anime fans to make up for it, making it a failure all around on BD sales.

And while I did not read the manga, I can understand why when looking at those comparisons between manga panels and anime scenes. The manga panels look way better, so I am not surprised that a lot of manga fans were disappointed by the anime. It looks like the director tried to tone down the goofy black comedy of the manga, which in retrospect was a mistake. It is a bit weird for Mappa to invest so much in this project only to give it to a newbie director who failed to reproduce the look of the original manga. 

Well, I personally did not like the anime because it was not to my tastes (I don’t like dark and edgy horror movies), but I am now thinking that it might also have been because it was a mediocre adaptation of the original manga. I might have liked it better if it had emphasised the black comedy aspect of the manga, since I usually like black comedy.",NekoCatSidhe,,14,14,2023-02-07 06:44:05

j7i87t5,t3_10vhu85,"Good writeup.  Honestly, I've always felt the ""streaming means bd sales don't matter"" thing to be a huge cope.  Yeah, it's not exactly the end all be all, but it serves as some level of referendum of fandom that isn't something stupid like MAL scores.  I mean if it didn't matter then BD gifts, which were a thing waaaay before streaming took off, would be on the decline instead of still a common fixture
  
Regarding the Nakayama interview(s), I'm surprised you didn't mention the thing he directly said about how he wanted to avoid the anime cliches like funny faces and characters with bright hair (two things that are in CSM).  There's another one where I believe he says he wanted to avoid being compared to something like Haruhi Suzumiya which was like the biggest 'oof' comment I could think of.  Not just because of it's popularity but also considering Disappearance of Haruhi does that same cinematic angle that he was going for with CSM but in a much better received way.  By that same regard, you mentioned Bocchi the Rock's director, Saitou, who if I remember correctly said something similar to Nakayama but in reverse.  That he directed Bocchi with the full intent to take advantage of the anime format.  This is something I remember animation enthusiasts tended to mention as these two values were in direct contrast with each other
   
Also, I wanted to thank you for clearing up that 8k/16k thing.  I was very confused at why I was getting two different numbers for what Mappa expected.  I bet part of why this disappointment is so public, besides that it's CSM, is that there is a hard number for what they were expecting in reception.  Most of the time, this kind of thing is ambiguous so we never get a clear idea of what the production wanted.  But we have a specific number for this case.
   
EDIT: I've been reading the thread and people are saying the BD sales numbers are fake.  Dude what?  Wasn't this 1st week number directly from Oricon?  How could they be fake?  Lotta people that probably aren't going to buy anything.     
EDIT 2: I'm really really disappointed in how many people are like ""lol didn't read"" or just shitting on OP.  I get not agreeing with OPs post, but disregarding them because they 'wrote too much' is pretty low.

Something that I haven't see anyone talk about is the price of 2nd hand goods in Mercari. I feel that the prices for merchandises in Mercari reflect on how intrigued fans are about buying the series merchandises. There's no easy way to tell if high price of X item is due to rarity or other supply factors but high prices of an item usually means they are in high demand.

Try to compare two series merchandises prices in Mercari and you'll see which fans are more willing to spend their money on. You can even gauge chara popularity from Mercari prices.",roamingphantom,,11,11,2023-02-07 02:11:02

My takeaway with this is that something has to and will change. No matter how you chock it up, the sale numbers speak for themselves. Either MAPPA finds a way to satisfy the Japanese fans, who did not like the cinematic direction, please the western fans, who either didn’t mind or liked the cinematic direction (based upon my own observations. I know a number of western fans did not like the cinematic direction but from what I’ve seen the reception hasn’t been so bad), or they have to pick a side and stick to it. I think that a good mix of both styles will be enough to at least pacify the fans who don’t want the cinematic style while still pleasing those who did like it.

For example, in the manga where power and denji go to the hideout of the bat devil and power realizes she misspoke, you turn the page and bam, instant action, instant resolution. In the anime this scene was way too drawn out, which lessens the impact of the scene. 
  
  
Other problems I have are scenes like when bat devil kidnaps the cat. In the manga you can see the panels fade to black, symbolizing power falling asleep, while in the anime you can see from power's point of view bat devil extending his hand slowly and across the screen to very slowly pick the cat up.

On top of that, its insane climax left me with a bad taste in my mouth no matter where the story decides to go from here.

>**Kotaku**: Days after finishing the game, I’m still trying to grapple with the consequences of Final Fantasy VII Remake’s ending, which will be heatedly debated in the weeks and months to come. It’s still not clear just what the developers at Square Enix plan to do next, but the ending makes it very clear that the project’s director, Tetsuya Nomura, has spent the past two decades as the chief creative behind Kingdom Hearts, the messiest and most complicated story in JRPG history.

>**Dualshockers**:And here is where it all started to come apart for me. For a brief while, I was ripped out of Final Fantasy 7 and dumped heavily into an unholy marriage of Advent Children and Kingdom Hearts. It was awkward, it was confusing, and it left me shaking my head in dismay. It felt massively out of place. Did this part have to change so dramatically? Maybe. It wasn’t a true climax or game-ending point in the original, after all, and I expected some new conclusion and an added boss or two to cap off this experience.

My overall score for FF7 is 8/10.


The game gets everything right with all the elements that they kept from the original, but fails with all the extra stuff they added. 

It's obvious the developers realised the game would probably only be 20 hours if they stuck to the original, so they added a bunch sidequests and filler content to pad up the hours. 

But the problem is, the sidequests are so hollow and  also break up the pace so jarringly. This only ends up highlighting the fact that you're playing an incomplete story.",earthbendinglemur,,33,33,2020-04-06 12:01:06

Betrayed, let down, depressed pretty much sums it up. I will never understand how they can market it as a remake and then completely change the story. The original was perfection and because of someone's ego they went and changed it, why did they try and change a perfect game.

The Fire Emblem parts were minimal and felt tacked on along with only featuring characters from like 2 of the (at the time) 14 games, can't speak too much on how well it does SMT but it felt like diet Persona, and the super animey idol aesthetic is a negative for some.

As for the localized side of things, the censorship didn't help especially with things like the Artbook getting censored. (the thing that shows you the artists original vision of the characters). The game appeals to the anime otaku market. Who's going to buy a censored anime game?

Even the Japanese critiques of the idol industry are lost. Things like a swimsuit photo shoot session being turned into a sports clothes photo shoot. The end result is that you get what's basically 4kids sanitizing Atlus and even worse a game journalist of Kotaku was defending the censorship and even saying ""I’m glad Japanese players will finally get to experience the game as I did."" Did I forget to mention the Japanese Switch version is the censored version, and that Nintendo of Japan had to give refunds?

And even if this wasn’t such a niche title, censorship would still decrease sales. There are plenty of people who refuse to buy a censored game because they feel they’re getting an incomplete/watered-down version of the game. I am not aware of anyone who, for this game or any other game, stated they wouldn’t buy something unless it’s censored.

However, no I don’t think this title could have sold as well as Persona 5, it’s much more niche, it’s target audience was people who were fans of FE and SMT who also were into Japanese Idol culture.

This was their excuse for the lack of English VA. Seeing how the game sold the real reason for this decision should be obvious,  but their choice of cover for this fact couldn't have been worse-picked. The fact that they COULD find the money to get the Japanese VA cast to record a bunch of new lines for a completely rewritten chapter 2 makes it even more frustrating.

Back on the Wii U, the game made more sense because it had little competition, there were few JRPGs available, no Fire Emblem to speak of either. The game was fun, but it was never going to be a massive hit to western audiences because of the theme, it still managed to sell a little and that's cool.

However, on the Switch, 4 years later, the mood had changed. The platform has a great variety of titles that cater to Japanese pop fans and JRPG fans much better than that game did. The game itself was largely forgotten in the meantime and the appeal of buying an old game that didn't make a ton of waves as it came out versus waiting for SMTV is pretty low. They would probably have been better off making a sequel than a re-release as the game is fine, but it was not this perfect genre-defining experience either at the time, competition was never going to make it look better or more polished. The Switch has been an alright platform so far with JRPGs, stuff like Octopath and Bravely Default helped it out greatly, the presence of actual Fire Emblems titles as well, and if what you want is waifu jrpgs, the online store has tons of those while the Wii U had next to nothing.",,,1,1,2021-08-28 16:45:58

But yeah, Ex-Arm was definitely an experience. Dunno if it was a result of so many companies wanting an anime of everything that they’ll throw anything into the fire to see if it works, or that there just isn’t enough animation manpower to get actual talent on hand for this one. 

The weird part is that I read the manga and compared to the anime, it’s not that bad. It’s sort of a basic plot (high school boy gets killed in an accident, wakes up 16 years old as an AI weapon, helps a cop and her gynoid partner fight crime by possessing the latter), but it’s at least tolerable.

iqsqed5,t3_xtuxnz,"I’m deeply ashamed to admit that I’m a pin collector and there was a LOT of pin drama at this year’s event. 

For those who aren’t in the know, D23 releases exclusive pins that go for $$$ on the secondary market. The two most highly coveted pins from this year - [Malificient and Figment profiles](https://disneypinsblog.com/wdi-pin-releases-on-friday-september-9th-at-mickeys-of-glendale-d23-expo-2022/) which originally sold at the event for $22.95 - go for ~$1200 a pop on the secondary market. The [Mulan Reflections pin](https://disneypinsblog.com/wdi-pin-releases-on-sunday-september-11th-at-mickeys-of-glendale-d23-expo-2022/) and some of the other profiles sell for $400-500 each (the original retail price was $26.95). 

Part of the reason these pins are so highly coveted are because they’re limited edition and produced in low quantities. For example the expensive pins I mentioned were LE 300, meaning only 300 are available at the event and the only ones that would ever be in existence. 

These highly coveted pin releases with high payouts at stake naturally creates bad behavior and as such there were many horror stories coming out of the event. 

- Almost everyone not following the rules, the line officially opens at 5am but people were lining up the day before. 

- During official line opening, the people towards the front of the line brought in literal vans full of people to share their spot in line and to crowd out the people behind them. Which means that even people who queued up in the afternoon the day before missed out on pins. 

- Drama because so-called influencers or at least well known names in the space were seen bussing people in or engaging in other bad behavior in line. 

- Disney had virtual queue but were apparently not honoring them or deprioritizing them for the standby line. So for many, the pins were sold out when your reservation was called up. 

- Just standing in line showed a total disregard for safety: reports of physical altercations in line, stampedes leading into the store, and shoving and pushing in the store itself. 

Of course, big foul on Disney themselves for not switching to a virtual lottery to buy the pins. Everything just sounds like a huge liability and honestly a miserable time for everyone involved.",,,490,490,2022-10-02 20:32:56

So, Twisted Wonderland! The Disney Japan mobile game (now released in english too) about a group of kids in a magic school themed around classic Disney villains.

First! They... Basically didn't announce there would *be* any TWST content there until less than 24hrs before D23 actually started, so people who might have gone for exclusive TWST goods had no idea this was happening, and the folks who *are* expected to be at D23 (diehard 'normal' disney fans) aren't usually the public for a cute boy collecting gacha game like this.

Second! [The sets used](https://twitter.com/blockwonkel/status/1568276645009555456) were literally just old sets from Magia Record, another game run and managed by Aniplex. Combined with point 1, and people got the feeling TWST wasn't really being taken care of in the west, but that was it, right?

iqt2eg8,t3_xtuxnz,"So, the theory I have (and I don't really know how true it is) is that, between the covid cash drain and the constant delays for the current big projects (GotG: Celestial Rewind, Tron), Imagineering is in a weird place where they basically have no bandwidth or budget for anything new. The people and money that would otherwise have been working on things in 2020 or 2021 to show at D23 2022 were all pulled to deal with issues or were delayed from getting further until Disney had a clearer idea of what was going on, and because this is Chapek Disney they just did not invest or think about this until it was far too late. The result is that the imagineers had nothing to show, so they just went over what they currently had with a light touch and gave ""blue sky"" ideas in hopes that, if any of the ideas got good enough reception, they could use that positive momentum to break through their current deadlocks and make some progress.

I kind of like the idea of showing some occasional blue skies and letting the audience respond because I like the idea of showing more of the development process and fans perhaps being able to sound off and help get good ideas going, but I also know why they don't usually do this and why this is a sign of desperation; you don't show things you don't know will come out because then people will want it, even if it turns out you had no fucking idea what you were doing and it will never work. I fully expect if all 3 of these lands do not come to pass there will be contingents of fans who will be upset, just like what has happened with pretty much every proposed then cancelled project that Disney has had for decades, and the fact that Disney is opening itself up to this trailing them for years shows that they had Nothing else.

That's not to say that there were no gameplay trailers in the showcase, but they were mostly for smaller games, like an *Alien* tactical RPG. There are lots of previously announced games in the works, especially from Marvel, and people were hoping for new info or trailers from those. 

Especially notable in its absence was *Spiderman 2* (official title unknown), the sequel to the best-selling PS4/5 game, which only appeared for a second in a compiled trailer of a bunch of games at the very end of the showcase.

The one thing I'm curious about, since I don't know how rigidly structured D23 is, is do they always have a theme park day? Like, is this the first year with such a disappointing showing and other years without much news they've just not had a theme park day? Basically, is there a reason for the expectations being so high because of the company's actions, or did the die hard fans just feel that starved? Like, I'm guessing that there wasn't much theme park news back in 2020 due to the pandemic?

I do understand that disappointed feeling, but the massive outcry of drama that always seems to emerge from it in fandom news is so overblown, and I can't help but want to push back. Like, save that outrage for important shit people!",magekiton,,39,39,2022-10-02 21:35:15

ijwmfjv,t3_wm0ay9,"The original Journey into Imagination is such a masterpiece of a dark ride, and as someone born a decade too late to remember it I desperately wish I could have seen it in its full glory. My parents worked at EPCOT Center in the 80s and they mourn its absence everytime they visit. 

*Despite all that,* I do find it hilarious how the current version of the ride is basically a parody of the turn-of-the-millennium Figmentless version. Current!Figment essentially goes ""screw science, the riders aren't here for that"" and fucks with Eric Idle, as though the Imagineers working on it were projecting their own negative feelings towards the 1999 science lesson iteration of the attraction into the new ride's script. It's a parody that barely any of the park's attendees would understand anymore, and it's clearly past its time, but I find it super fascinating how perfectly it encapsulates Epcot's growing pains. 

Like, they replaced a creative ride about imagination with a bland science-based version that emphasizes the lack of imagination Disney/Kodak had about reviving the ride. Then, they replaced that ride with a new version making fun of the prior ride's science-based take that also lacked imagination, instead making imagination look like something that's annoying and disruptive rather than something that contributes to society. It really all meshes well with Epcot itself having such a confused identity as Disney struggles to nail what the park's future truly is. Is it an educational experience that attempts to immerse and teach guests, or is it a celebration of Disney characters and nostalgia (such as Figment at this point) like most other Disney parks?  They seem to be trending more towards the latter, and I just find it fascinating how much the new version of the ride has seemed to foreshadow that by having such a shallow and self-referential take on the Figment character (just as a lot of modern Disney attractions tend to also be about seeing Disney worlds and characters in shallow and self-referential ways instead of telling new stories unconnected to intellectual properties)",Rarietty,,280,280,2022-08-11 20:37:21

It’s still a professor-favorite case for every Negotiations class I’ve taken, as a prime example of what *not* to do when negotiating on foreign lands. Disney did everything wrong, from building the park without informing to the locals and assuming that they could just “bulldoze” over objections, banning alcohol consumption in *France*, showing a general disregard of the French provincial governments in the region they wanted to operate in, and so on and so forth. I do think their failure with EuroDisney was about 90% their own doing, the result of their own arrogance and ignorance of local customs. 

As a small aside, in a negotiation simulation class, I played one of the French bureaucrats who were supposed to mediate between the local officials and Disney lawyers. Even though it was a simulation everybody lost their mind; only half an hour later we were all yelling at each other, including me. At the end the professor pointed at me and said “She’s the most soft spoken in this class, and this simulation made her slam her papers and walk away.

I loved Disney growing up and Epcot was my favorite park. I think the first time I went was a couple of years after it opened and I thought it was the coolest thing I’d ever seen. I absolutely fell in love with Journey Into Imagination and Figment. 

We lived in easy driving distance of Orlando and went to Disney every few years. I worked at The Disney Store in college and got free park tickets, so mom and I went to the park to celebrate my college graduation. I ran to Journey Into Imagination the second the gates opened…to find it closed. I hadn’t been there in years and was crushed as I was so excited for that ride. I LOVED Figment. Visibly disappointed, a cast member tried to cheer me up by telling me next time I came it would be new and improved. 

Fast forward a couple of years later. I’m in Orlando on a business trip and of course I’m going to work in a visit to my favorite park. So I run straight to the Imagination ride to find it….closed. Are you kidding me? This time a cast member saw me and told me that the changes weren’t as beloved and they’d removed Figment, but don’t worry when it reopened he’d be back. I had to admit that a closed ride was better than if I’d gone on and didn’t see Figment. 

A few years later I went with friends to drink copious amounts of wine at their Food and Wine festival. I’d told them, however, that we WOULD be stopping at the Imagination ride. Non-negotiable. And that if it was closed, someone better open it up for me anyway. 

We got there and it was open and I was way too excited for an adult to ride a kids ride. I was giddy. And then I rode the ride. All giddiness disappeared. I was crushed. What did they do to the Dreamcatcher and, by extension, my childhood?

I didn’t understand it and I’ve harbored a grudge ever since. I’ve wondered what happened during the various times it was closed and why, but I never took the time to research it. So thank you for finally addressing and resolving this minor decade+ trauma. ;)",LadyMRedd,,3,3,2022-08-22 23:16:03

All of that before 26 birthday, when he was brutally fouled by Roy McFarland in WC qualification game against England (6 June 1973). He wasn't playing for two years, and missed out 1974 WC, when Poland achieved 3rd place.

For WAG, if Jade had been pacing for trials rather than the Olympics, I think her odds were quite good. I've heard the same for Vanessa, though I'm not as familiar with Italy's selection parameters.

For MAG, I have no idea. But while I want \*all\* the gymnasts to be at the Olympics, I don't know that this data actually shows that we're missing out significantly on medal contenders if we don't consider that they may just be incorporated into the team with a slightly larger team size.

kag0pia,t3_181k12p,"Thank you so much for this!! 

I personally did not know about Lily/Taylor until very recently on this sub! I think it makes a lot of sense. 

All of Taylor's albums have a mix of love and heartbreak songs. So I feel like there are always multiple muses featured on an album. The current one/new one and an ex. Or multiple exes. Which is why it never fully made sense to me that all of rep and all of lover were about karlie. I think the new long songs on 1989 are karlie and the exs are Diana. So on rep and lover the exs being about Karlie and new love being about Lily would make a lot of sense! 

Also I've said this before, I think sometimes Taylor may start with a specific muse in mind but it can become more broad and even reflect on patterns in her love life. Especially if it is about secret wlw relationships. 

Like I personally think Getaway Car is about Karlie and it makes even MORE sense if she left Karlie for Lily, another model who ran in the same circles. 

My theory about Karlie and Taylor is that Taylor was the other woman. Some have speculated Karlie and Josh are in an open relationship. I definitely prefer that theory. It's nicer to think about! But I feel like Taylor's lyrics say something else.

""The ties were black, the lies were white""

""But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story, and now we're both sorry""

""We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side, to the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in (oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar""

I could see Karlie telling Taylor she was going to marry Josh but it didn't have to change anything between them. And Taylor chosing to leave instead of staying in that situation. Also, illicit affairs I think is about her and Karlie and having an affair. 

I also think this is the deep betrayal she references DBATC:

""Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper thin plans""

Maybe she had plans to leave him but ultimately didn't. It makes more sense that this song about an ex is paired with Paper Rings about the current love, Lily. What a beautiful connection, one paper to hurt you and one paper to commit to you. I always thought these songs were connected. Paper cut vs paper ring. Also paper rings references past loves:

""Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall,""

Your analysis of champagne problems is very interesting!! I always thought it was about Karlie because of this line especially:

""How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again""

And that word being ""squad"" since they got destroyed in the media for it. Although, it could be interesting if this song was about both, in a way:

""One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready, so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you""

A lot of people interpret ""one for the money, two for the show"" as Karlie's 2 weddings. But maybe, it's about Taylor. ""One for the money"" could refer to her losing the love of her life (or who she thought was at that time) to money. The kushners. Two, the second love of her life (who she thought was at that time) Lily, because Taylor wasn't ready to come out. She's still putting on a show.

Anyway, really great analysis!! I'm really excited to relisten to these albums with this info and see what I notice ❤️",piercecharlie,,46,46,2023-11-23 14:59:07

I’d also like to ask some of the people who are smarter than me to look over the Daily Mail articles about Lily. They’re known for posting absolute non-stories (like look at this woman wearing clothes!) when they want to subtly hint at something they aren’t allowed to print. They will then drop very subtle clues into the articles as to what they want to actually say. It might be hard to do without knowing what else was printed at the time though as sometimes you need the context of what else was going on eg if there’s an article about an injunction on that same day.",IKnowThatImPetty,,30,30,2023-11-23 08:56:47

You done good, kid. My Tily heart runneth over!! What a wonderful, well thought out, beautifully written post! I love your writing, and you can see all the care and hard work you put into this! As a frustrated Tily truther in this sub (I know you know what I’m talking about w/the m\*ds and the coverups 😂), I’m delighted to see so many new Tily believers because of your post, great job!! I especially loved your format, the ease of following and all the new evidence you gifted us with! But the cherry on top was not even including the ring because that is the only thing the nay sayers use to refute Tily and it’s the worst argument in the Gaylor fandom. There is so much other evidence not counting the ring, loved that mic drop.

Like you, I feel like Lily deserves so much more love from the fandom, esp considering she was the best partner to Taylor and seems to have been the only supportive and healthy relationship she has had. Lily deserves credit and respect for that! She supported Taylor in her darkest time, and seems to have helped her heal and grow immensely during their time together. Lily was her longest “Lover”, and she has always been the most interesting muse to me. I look forward to more of your posts! xo",villanellaella,,22,22,2023-12-01 00:30:08

kbih14i,t3_181k12p,"this is incredible! a breathtaking amount of work. it's so wild to imagine, if it really was lily from 2016- 2019, what it's been like for taylor to see kaylors (and eventually karlie herself lol) latch onto all of these references.

i'll admit that one of the things i find suuuuper fulfilling about taylor's songwriting is her incredible ability to use imagery across several different songs/albums, and create callbacks. it's kinda weird to rewrite so many of my mental narratives to be about someone else!

but also honestly while i'm sure karlie and lily are different people in terms of personality (and indeed if we want to think about an ""angel boyfriend"" i actually think joe and lily are publicly withdrawn and british in almost exactly the same way lol), it's also true that on paper they are similar in many ways. i can still barely tell lily and martha hunt apart so it makes sense to me why imagery that could be linked to karlie could honestly work for any blonde model with light eyes.

it's definitely interesting to think about kaylor breaking up in 2016... when karlie would have been 23 still (for the first half of the year) and also putting her at \~2 years before her wedding, so right on time to start the conversion process. it's kind of wild to imagine taylor writing multiple incredibly tragic songs about karlie still in 2020, but i have also long-imagined that many of the everlore songs already existed in one form or another and were being saved for the right project.

i know the public likes to have this narrative that taylor is so confessional that she can perform these incredibly emotional songs as soon as they come into existence. but it makes a lot of sense to me that she would hold onto them for a while before sharing them (and that part of her heart) with the world.

Is Taylor telling us if she were a man she'd just want to do business deals on a yacht with beautiful models or if she were a man just date a bunch of beautiful models? lol 

It also kind of sparks my intrigue in some theories that Taylor is writing lyrics in a way that causes fans to search certain terms and that's what shows up the most instead of what was originally posted (such as Slut! being a campaign to push down all of the old slut-shaming articles of 1989). When you search Leo in St. Tropez, you also get photos of Taylor with models like the squad and screencaps from The Man music video. Add that with the lyrics and her inspiration as what she would do if she were a man, if she was trying to make herself look less queer and more hetero, it kind of backfired.",honoraryweasley,,5,5,2023-12-10 19:53:10

But I do think there’s more opportunities for me. I feel like even just marketability, people tend to favor white people, white males, white women. I think it should be equal opportunity.

I may be remembering this entirely wrong but I have a memory rattling around my brain that G&S had pissed off a lot of people in the British government with some super direct hits, and those people started making threatening noises.

iyglmn2,t3_z8o4bz,"I appreciate the depth of this write-up! Out of curiosity, has anyone tried the ""unchanged anime localisation"" method (a la the [Ace Attorney](https://www.awkwardzombie.com/comic/culture-schlock) games)? My imagining of this is having everyone be in exaggeratedly English clothing on an English-looking set the whole way through, while pointedly stating how much they love the great nation of Japan that they are currently in. I'm not a big opera buff, so I don't know how this would play on stage, but it seems in line with some of the productions you've mentioned already.

I feel like the problem of The Mikado being racist presents more of an opportunity than a hindrance - each production that grapples with it in good faith comments on the culture's historical (and current!) relationship with orientalism. If The Mikado were avoided entirely, it feels like the conversation would've ended with: ""hey, look at how racist the English were! (Isn't it nice how we're not racist...anymore?)"" Given The Mikdao's massive cultural footprint, it feels like such a huge potential vehicle for insightful commentary on an underdiscussed topic.

I don't think there's much that can stop the ""ignore/dismiss"" productions that isn't already being done (like that 2015 NYGASP production protest leading to its cancellation). I think that stuff should keep being done, but I appreciate the work of the reckoners and reclaimers. They definitely won't make perfect decisions all the time either, but their productions make people think more about orientalism and anti-Japanese racism than they would've otherwise - and I think that's valuable.",beauregard_one,,19,19,2022-12-01 06:01:05
iyploe5,t3_z8o4bz,"I was a young Asian teenager in a strange land Down Under when my homestay family took me to see a local production of the Mikado. 

It has been 20 years since and I'm still digesting what the heck it was that I saw.

This article has given me a modicum of closure in a way that I didn't expect but thankful regardless. 

Now I can move on, no longer feeling like an uneducated savage for finding the opera an incongruent mess of casual racism despite it being the homestay family's best understanding of something 'Asian' for me to see.

And no, I wasn't even from Japan.

I don’t think anyone understood the historical context either. The choir teacher who also directs the extracurricular musical program always chooses the musical. I think he knew that it was “really” about British people and therefore not problematic in his view, but the students were not super happy with the choice and I think felt uncomfortable with the yellowface (but went along with it because the adult told them it was okay).",knittinghoney,,10,10,2022-12-01 06:32:46

iydalim,t3_z8o4bz,"God, so funny to see a post about this popping up. The Mikado is a christmas tradition for my boyfriend, if you want to go watch it (and I highly recommend you do), I hate to say it but the single best performance is the [Stratford One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw2Tr9xBw1Y) imho. Despite it being...*ahem*...more clearly yellowface, it is also just theatrically absolutely bonkers good. Pooh-bah and Ko-Ko's actors are exceedingly strong. The stage isn't as extravagant or filled as some other productions, leaving full focus on the actors.

When we first watched it together we had vaguely the same argument about it. I mean, it's *obviously* yellowface, and *obviously* ""racist"". It's a hard case to crack, normally I'd just say ""it wasn't malicious, so the original producers are fine. And the today versions should just be updated not to include yellowface just like they excluded the n-word"". 

problem is, that's been tried, and I'll be fully honest, the productions that simply forgo the japanese subtext and place it fully in british or western society just do not hit nearly as well. So you end up having a choice between lessening a genuinely good, non malicious piece of satiric art, while it still being obviously plain to all that it's not (and rightfully so) acceptable to keep it as is. 

(my personal take is just give up. Keep the recordings of the production as is, they can live within the context of their time, and don't try and modernise it into our time. Some pieces of art simply cannot be taken out of their time without breaking parts, and we just have to accept that.)",funkybullschrimp,,22,22,2022-11-30 15:34:56

A Little List is one of the best pieces of operatic comedy around imho…trawling through YouTube for all the different variations is such a great rabbit hole.

In saying that I only recently ever started connecting the implications of being set in Japan. There’s some great interpretations out there, and also a lot of “purists” who think it’s sacrilege *not* to do yellow face.

My mum’s singing student also performed in it, but I can’t remember anything other than the little list song, which I thought was hysterical, especially since they added in a ‘Vampire Novelists’ line.

Even without talking about Selen, the branch has been doing somewhat poorly. Their explosive growth from the pandemic has slowed down (as has all Vtubers really), but it's concerning when combined with graduations of top talents and shotgunning out new members so fast that the newest generation doesn't even have an official name and many didn't even know they debuted. Clearly management in NijiEN hasn't been doing enough no matter how you cut it.

ktg3k5k,t3_1b6wl7k,"I always got the feeling Anycolor doesn't really know how to start and support a new branch from scratch without talents who can hit the ground running. When they started the JP branch, they struck gold with Tsukino Mito, who due to her personality, talk skills, and willingness to do attention grabbing streams immediately got her, and the entire company, a lot of attention relatively quickly with minimal management support. And now that they have an established presence, new JP livers get a support with things like appearances on official shows and collaborations. But for a brand new foreign branch, they seem to be relying on catching lightning in a bottle again, hoping that the 1st gen whatever branch can get a lot of attention and establish themselves independently, and they don't really know how to help one get the initial attention.

Also, I'm fairly sure I remember reading that Shanghai, Taipei, and India were pet projects of Fumoto Yoshitaka, one of the Anycolor executives. That might also be why they had so little support.",Pariell,,30,30,2024-03-05 13:23:15

I think that the primary difference between Hololive and Nijisanji, and therefore Cover and Anycolor, is based on this: It's my understanding that Cover stumbled ass-backwards into being a VTuber agency.  Sora, their first talent, and A-Chan, were the ones who pitched the idea to Cover.  And so a lot more of their decisions have come from the people who are affected by them, rather than tech people who don't know the ""entertainment industry""- that is, Cover's business model seems to be to stay out of the way and let their talents and managers do what is best for them, and that seems to work\* much better than what Anycolor is trying to do.

\*It definitely occasionally leads to them getting caught with their pants down where they don't know what to do in a particular situation- the whole Uruha Rushia kerfuffle shows me that, and it took them quite a while to be able to provide enough support to HoloMyth- I think Kiara and Ame were doing so much to support their friends behind the scenes early on- but where I will give Cover mad props is that they appear to never have made the same mistake twice.",Big_Falcon89,,20,20,2024-03-05 18:01:49

I do want to see if there will be any significant change in direction for EN based on this past precedent. There's a lot of doomposters on the Nijisanji sub saying that it's inevitable that EN will be merged into the main branch like ID and KR were, and part of me wonders what its future could realistically be if that happens (though I seriously doubt it will).

hclg4yu,t3_pmgmrw,"Awesome job OP! I’m glad you mentioned the robberies, they have been plaguing my mind since LVP was on the show. I didn’t read part 1 just 2 & 3- maybe you mentioned it in part one, but I seem to remember Kyle getting robbed too. She went to the police station about the robbery to question the lawn maintenance people and saw LVP at the police station and her reaction really surprised me. It’s as if she thought LVP knew of their cons/scams and was reporting on them. Kyle immediately went to tell the other con-artists that LVP was at the police station and they all freaked out and pondered why LVP was there and I believe that is when they formulated the ruse against LVP to get her to quit the show. I still think Rinna is the one that sold the dog story to the press, to blame it on LVP and turn the other women against her and force her out. They (fox force 5) are running a con/insurance fraud/hiding assets scam or something and I felt so strong about that when LVP quit the show I could no longer watch these snakes hiss at each other anymore. LVP is by the way an actual self made woman and too legit for these cons. After Housewife and the Hustler came out I had to back track and rewatch everything I’d missed to try and piece this all together. So glad these cons are finally being called out! 

(Unrelated thought that has been plaguing me: Teddi’s house, that she rented out after they purchased their new home, was leased by the rapper Pop Smoke and he was murdered in her house. Something about the Tom/Erika, Kyle, and Dorit burglaries and Teddi’s house murder all seem really sus to me.)",Idiocrazy,,10,10,2021-09-12 18:50:05

g7roi88,t3_j5ci0i,"Also of note: Sparda.

Sparda is the father of Dante and Vergil, [the Legendary Dark Knight who “woke up to justice,”](https://images.app.goo.gl/eBAGLqi9BpJuudSn8) and rebelled against the Demon King Mundus 2000 years ago. He then sealed his powers away in the Force Edge, wandered the Earth before falling in love with Eva, having Dante and Vergil with her, and then dying of unknown causes. He is such a powerful and imposing figure that we will most likely NEVER see his story in full, because it would probably never live up to the legend built around him.

[THIS is what they did to him in the reboot.](https://images.app.goo.gl/qKbE5wbvgHYytEiE7) They turned him into a generic demon that served as Mundus’ right-hand man before running off with an angel. He was then turned into a gimp and his punishment is to be subjected to bondage and CBT for eternity. So he’s still alive in the reboot, but there is never any suggestion or hint of Dante and Vergil going to Hell to save him.

DMC is about dealing with the histories our families leave with us and how bullshit it can be, and growing into it or beyond the crap they gave us.

g7rifqj,t3_j5ci0i,"The thing that was kind of skipped over, with DMC4 people were nervous about Nero being the apparent lead. People wanted to play as Dante and it takes a while to get to the point you can play with him, so I remember my friends playing and wondering if he was even an option. They got lucky that people decided they liked Nero, who at the time was like Emo Teen Dante. Which might have been the reason they thought people wanted an entire game of an Emo Teen Dante.

DmC Dante ends up sounding a bit like Nero. I cracked up at the ""Fuck"" Off, because it came off to me that he didn't know how to make good insults and neither does his opponent. The big dick comment was odd. They were trying to make a 'these guys are brothers' joke and it falls kind of flat because they aren't really at that level yet. It was almost attempting to emulate *Supernatural* (Bitch/Jerk) but didn't quite get there.

Where DmC Dante really falls apart is... it's hinted at that while Dante Prime is an attractive, athletic male, he doesn't get laid much. Possibly because he engages in soliloquies with demon scientists who want to kill him. At his heart, he's a goofball edgelord, he just happens to have the ability to slay all the demons in the world and is nearly immortal.

g7sth1m,t3_j5ci0i,"I remember when this all went down. I was one of those people who wanted to play the game before casting judgment, but Tameen's attitude made it difficult. I understand wanting to make changes when rebooting/remaking a series, but I don't recommend antagonizing and mocking those who love the original series. They are supposed to be the bulk of interest for the new series. Otherwise, what is the point of rebooting a well-known series if not to use the name to bring in the original audience? Nostalgia is a powerful force. 

When I finally played the game, I was split down the middle. The actual game play and combat was fun and fluid. The environments, especially when being pulled into Limbo, were really interesting to look at, thought maybe a bit too saturated, and it worked so well with the bleak mood they were setting up. The animations looked great and still do all things considered. The boss fight with Bob was definitely my favorite and it was pretty unique. Also, the soundtrack was fire. 

The issues I had? It was the writing, to put it plainly. The characters weren't interesting and were very stereotypical, which is sad considering DMC is known for its characters breaking the molds. The dialogue made me cringe so much because it was trying to be so cool and intimidating, but it just came off as, ""edgy."" It didn't immerse me in the story; it pulled me out. I also had an issue with how the female characters were handled. Kat was just a tool to bring Dante into the mix, inform us on the rules of the world, and to give him motivation to change. With a few minor changes, you could remove her from the story and it wouldn't affect it. The other female characters were all portrayed as disgusting, with the exception of Dante and Vergil's mother, but we only know of her through memories. The abortion rifle scene was just abhorrent. This game did not have the right to tackle that. Had he just shot her in the head, it would still be fucked, but it could be argued that he was doing what he thought was necessary and the story would have played out the same way. Shooting her stomach and then her head was just way too far and it was such a level of spite and depravity that I don't believe Vergil had reached. I don't believe he was that radicalized to justify it to himself and I don't like how the other characters just shrugged it off and it was never addressed again. It just felt like something the writers did for shock value alone and it definitely did not sit well with me. I like dark, fucked up shit, but the execution of said shit matters.

g7s1r3v,t3_j5ci0i,"DmC was *fine*, but the DLC (Vergil's downfall) kicked ass. I love replaying it just for the combat on the high difficulties and the fantastic animated cutscenes by Danijel Zezelj. It's a good little game because it's short and sweet and I think the weapons are really well balanced, far better than the main game. Vergil handles very nicely with his Yamato, and with hook-type weapons and scythes instead of guns it feels silky smooth. It's definitely not as brutal as earlier DMC games, but if you get up onto the high difficulty settings it does take a bit of skill. 

It's a shame that there was no sequel, but obviously given the fan reaction to the reboot, that was out of the question. They released a comic as a prequel centred on Vergil, but it kinda sucked.

DmC had really good concepts and environments, it's just a shame that it couldn't live up to the original trilogy. And the sniper rifle abortion is just... well. The anaonymous Vergil thing was always going to get old fast, I don't know how they thought it would be a good idea.

 DMC's always been edgy, but it still had a sense of humour which made up for the grimdark storylines and questionable writing. DmC just felt mean-spirited at times, and the jokes didn't land.",,,14,14,2020-10-05 11:47:01

There are 2D and FPS analogs, but really no other games where you can style-beast a la a 3rd person single-player fighting game.

That fucking DmC story though. Woof. To this day I can’t understand games media slobbering all over its “maturity” when it’s genuinely, *genuinely* the most misogynistic game I’ve ever played, starring a poor man’s Sid Vicious.

The game *starts* with Donte fucking two girls in his trailer. “Look how cool he is! Look! He’s having sex with *TWO* girls! Please clap!”

It’s not like we were starved for edgy fuckboy protagonists in the early 2010s. If anything, we were starved of fun goofballs like original Dante.

f9zrroh,t3_e7hkyy,"I think that this is because the anime hasn't reached the climax, if there will be a 2nd season it will be literally pure fire. And in the manga the fan service is less evident, like the comedy scenes",Matty17x,,16,16,2019-12-07 18:53:10
fa08h51,t3_e7hkyy,"I'm disappointed by the slight variances the anime has from the manga. My biggest one is the fact that the infernal in episode 2 (the father who's head is burning) doesnt talk, and is shown to be as mindless as the rest. In the manga, they show the daughter finding her father, who is barely holding onto his conscience, and actually speaks. The anime doesnt include this (in my opinion) vital scene that really shows what the fire force is killing. They also censor ohbi saying they're killing people but that's not as important, in my opinion.

If you compare this to demon slayer, the anime is pretty much a 1:1 translation. Demon slayers anime is objectively superior to the manga because it conveys EVERYTHING the manga does but presents it in a media format which gives more depth (animation, obviously, but also sound design)

Fire Force is by no means a bad anime, it has superb animation and still conveys the same story as the manga, but I just feel like these small changes dampen the experience for me.",SirPhantomIII,,10,10,2019-12-07 20:29:00

I'd even wager that anime fans in Japan are used to the time slot. Plus most of them can be streamed for free after it airs on GYAO/TVer/Netflix Japan; the time slot isn't that much of a con now. And to be honest, it's hard for most anime series to pull in ratings these days during the golden time slot (18:00~22:00).",MindyMayonnaise,,1,1,2019-12-08 00:39:15

particularly, that 2/3 of the agents were not accredited as anti-doping agents, all were found to be acting unprofessional (in an enquiry) and that there were inconsistencies in the paperwork. The linked news article below goes into greater detail.

But considering the importance and impact drug tests can have on an athletes career, I can also imagine an elite athlete (and their team)being very stressed and not allowing 3 people who were acting unprofessional to take a vial of their blood for purposes unknown, especially when advised by his lawyers and swimming officials to not sign paperwork.

ev1nuuo,t3_cgkb8v,"So I've got a question

I used to be really into weight lifting and my general understanding was that a significant amount of serious athletes were using steroids during off season for training and the doping rules were to make sure no one was using it while competing. A lot of countries also have significantly looser regulations on steroids for this exact reason, and it should be used to have the most effecient training time, but not used during competition to prevent it from becoming a technology race with potentially dangerous effects to the athletes, like what was going on with Russia in the 50s and late 40s.

Is this totally incorrect, or only correct for weight lifting maybe? I just assumed it was totally normal and accepted so long as it wasn't done during competition. Which is not in defense of that swimmer or anything because it obviously gives you a gigantic advantage, especially when everyone else is playing by the rules",venusblue38,,3,3,2019-07-26 17:28:56

fmmk2f2,t3_fvzi84,"I've never been big into the Final Fantasy games, mostly because I just cannot get into turn-based combat, so I'm looking forward to this. I played FF9 couple of years ago on iOS, using all the cheats, and really enjoyed the story. Tried playing FF7 the same way but just couldn't deal with the gameplay. But I am interested in the story, so I am looking forward to this one with its modern combat and everything else. I'm a big Bloodborne fan, so anything with real-time/action combat is a huge draw for me. 

The Kotaku review does a good job of explaining how turn-based combat was a result of the technical limitations of the time, and modern real-time/action combat allows for a much better/more immersive game.",perennialpurist,,2,2,2020-04-06 20:58:22

It drags on and is padded out? People expected side quests the quality of Witcher 3 from this it feels like, and that I have the patience of an old person. Should be a good benchmark of how you remake one small part of a game into its own separate thing.

If I gave it a scored review it'd be high in large part from the absolutely excellent gameplay that I'm still enjoying, hunting trophies now.

I haven't played it, but I feel like it can't radically change enough to be worth $60 as if it was an entirely different game because it's still called FF7. 

If it's like how different FFXV is from Versus XIII, then I think it would be worth $60. I don't think it's worth any more than $40.

I think that trump will send troops to help the Mexican government eliminate cartels but no war will happen, there's also another big reason it won't happen and that is BRICS which Mexico will join if trump attacks which will then be devastating to the dollar and severely harm the economy of the USA. Russia and China are really wooing Mexico to join BRICS and at this point I think Mexico should accept the invitation because trump loves to push his weight around and we will lose many allies because of him. ",LiberalAtheistKitty,,1,1,2025-01-16 10:49:42

gnrvkk4,t3_llo0y7,"This is a great write-up OP!

However, I'm absolutely gutted to read about this. I'm not a RK fan so this completely slipped under my radar but this anime was almost impossible to miss growing up- and I watched some episodes casually when it was on TV. Knowing now that the author has exploited children who were my age at the time is just giving me the chills.

I for one will find it very difficult to dissociate the author with the work, especially with such a serious crime as child pornography. 

Unfortunately, it says alot about big companies like Jump and Shueisha that they're willing to close one eye in favour of making bank off a big and what was most certainly a very culturally defining series not just in Japan but worldwide. I'm also really disappointed by all the messages of support from authors who pen series that are some of my favourites as well. 

These companies produce(?) distribute (?) many of the good/well known manga series too so they're super hard to boycott if you're a manga or anime fan too, ugh!

I wonder if there was any clapback from the public about this exhibition? I feel that public perception towards this sorts of crimes in asia is still rather laissez fair compared to the west (I do apologise if this offends anyone, I am from south east asia myself so these are based on my own perceptions). People tend to simply think 'oh he has received punishment from the law so it's fine' even though those punishments are just a slap on the wrist.",Volteehee,,59,59,2021-02-17 15:43:42

go3zcpx,t3_llo0y7,I don’t think it’s a valid to criticize a company for profiting off one of its IPs just because the creator is a piece of shit. I’m also not going to enjoy RK any less because of its author. It’s important to separate the art from the artist.,Bladewing10,,0,0,2021-02-20 11:16:19
gnr34yc,t3_llo0y7,"My question has always been how art can always exist within its own entity, all without the need to associate them with its creators. I take the philosophy from the French painter [René Magritte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte), particularly from his work of ***The Treachery of Images*** ([French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): *La Trahison des images*), which is a 1929 painting.

[*The Treachery of Images*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images) (*La trahison des images*), which shows a [pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_pipe_(tobacco)) that looks as though it is a model for a tobacco store advertisement. Magritte painted below the pipe ""*Ceci n'est pas une pipe*"" (""This is not a pipe""), which seems a contradiction, but is actually true: the painting is not a pipe, it is an *image* of a pipe. It does not ""satisfy emotionally""—when Magritte was once asked about this image, he replied that of course it was not a pipe, just try to fill it with tobacco.

This goes to show that no matter how many real-world connections we can correlate with art, or even with the artists, the connections are only there because we *allowed* it. As such, we could easily allow the personal, subjective experience of art for the sake of art, as if it existed in a vacuum with no creators needed. It's a myth to think that it could not exists in a vacuum. Not if art means nothing until we say, think, or feel it does.

Similarly, RK is NOT Watsuki, and Watsuki is NOT RK. Just because they created it, it does not mean the *thing* *is* RK. Any subjective experiences from an individual *belong to the individual*, and *it does not belong to Watsuki*. In this way, art can, in fact, ***exists in a vacuum***, as it does not merely exist as a causative property, it exists also as something that can be unique to us.

Consider RK as a child of Watsuki. If the father is an asshole, does that mean the child should be punished for the sins of the father? Or even those who love that child as its own person (in this context, it's own thing)?  


In fact, I was ignorant of who even Watsuki is until now, and the memories of RK did not change for me. That my friend is ""proof"" how art can exist in a vacuum because people forget to consider the individual, personal universes where the laws of physics are not the same as the one we knew.",,,-5,-5,2021-02-17 10:35:00
gvfbw8m,t3_llo0y7,"The most disgusting thing from this situation is the hypocrisy and ignorance of people. talking about someone with a mental disorder ( hebephilia, not pedophilia), as if he was some sort of monster. Meanwhile other mental disorders that may or may not also cause harm to others aren't demonized like so.

This exact behavior is what leads to these people being afraid to seek help, or they don't even recognize it is an issue, because all people do is talk of them as evil. As long as misinformed people continue to mock people with mental disorders nothing will change and this will continue to happen.

For those who haven't grasped it yet, here is a simple example: If you were to meet a guy with Autism, would you mock him, tell him he is (insert offense), and tell him to simply stop being the way he was born?  Bet that would be seen as twisted... right? Well, this comment section is full of such people that help perpetuate the issue.

The interesting takeaway is that toxicity has no boundaries, and since the precedent is set, there's no limit to how many more games/ anime/ manga/ people etc. this toxicity will victimise.

Trolls will be emboldened to ""stir sh*t"", as some would describe, without much concern, since their campaigns look effective.

China-Japan tension has always been there, but the lockdowns and COVID-19 stress changed some people... 

If ultra-nationalistic trends continue, a lot of businesses will have severe issues. Hopefully it does not come to that. Also, so far all we have been hearing seem to be from the China side.

\- From[SCMP news article](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3121883/japan-voice-actress-ai-kayano-sparks-anger-chinas-social-media) (There's more but you'd have to pay)

Makoto Watanabe, a professor of communications at Hokkaido Bunkyo University, said it was likely Kayano simply did not realize the full significance of her visit and the anger it would arouse.

“There is a trend among young people in Japan now to visit old temples and shrines around the country and to admire the spiritual and natural world more than perhaps their parents’ generations did,” he said.

Knowing that Japan has been known to whitewash its history, I don't blame her for not knowing. For those that say that she should have known better or should have done research on the shrine, would you do research on it if you know barely know it existed or you'd think it didn't matter much or had any huge significance?

Also in the YouTube broadcast, Kayano said she had recently visited the Yasukuni Shrine and described it as “comfortable” and adding that the air there was fresh. She also mentioned the visit on her Twitter page, although both posts have since been deleted. Kayano also had visited the shrine in her private time and was unlikely to have intentionally tried to disrespect Chinese fans. (Note that this information doesn't match up with the OP's comment of the broadcast

>She never mentioned anything related to history or politics. Nor did she ever mentioned the name of the Shrine.

I'm not saying he's wrong or I'm right, heck I could be wrong myself since I truly don't know what was in the full broadcast and I am taken my info from a news article.

The video was secretly taken inside the pavilion of Yasukuni Shrine, and what was inside that pavilion is basically the same as Nazis saying its invasion was just.

ifwc24u,t3_vx9trl,"**First criticism that comes to mind** - You yourself noted that Letterboxd and Serializd have (apparently) huge overlaps of users. So (if we were to assume that it is not a substantial overlap between them and MAL and IMDB) you're adding additional weight to those users' opinions by treating those two sources as equal to the other two individual sources. I.e. you're saying there are 3 user bases, A, B, and C, but rather than taking the average by dividing their cumulative ratings by 3, you're taking the ""average"" of A+B+2*C.

&nbsp;

**Second criticism that comes to mind** - You don't seem to be accounting for number of users within each score source. If 300,000 users rate something on IMDB, giving it an overall 7/10, and 50 users rate it on MAL with an overall 9/10, your method would say it should be an 8/10 ? Isn't that pretty ridiculous?

&nbsp;

**Third criticism that comes to mind** - The number of sources you have is very low and they are very similar. IMDB is not really a ""mainstream"" outlet in the sense that the average person does not go and rank something on IMDB after they watch it - you would want something more like the statistics released by streaming/broadcast companies reflecting the viewership trends of their users. Conversely, Letterboxd and Serializd are just additional social media tracker platforms, not that dissimilar from IMDB or MAL and I am skeptical of the notion that they somehow represent a significantly more ""critical"" userbase - it's not like they are collating professional reviewers and publications here. 

Then consider how all of your sites have very similar demographics - e.g. U.S.A. is the dominant userbase for all 3 (36% of IMDB visitors, 32% of Letterboxd, 22% of MAL), they are all primarily for an English-speaking audience, etc. If your sources are all geared towards the same demographic subset, how can you know whether it is representative or not?

ifuj6g8,t3_vx9trl,"Also, I would like to point out that this list does not take into account other things like the amount of acclaim a show gets or how well it is regarded among critics (although the top 35 at least have considerable overlap.)There are other posts like the top 500 movies of all time list which basically did what I did but also add the critics side to it as well. If I included that component then spirited away and some other ghibli films are by FAR the most acclaimed anime on this list, and since spirited away is already so close to being #1, it would probably be #1 in an overall ranking that combines users, critics, and acclaim.

I also didn't include the NUMBER of votes into this calculation. The only exception would be  if there are too little letterboxd/serializd votes and I have to omit the score. If I include the number of voters then stuff like mushishi and gintama and LOGH  would definitely go down, while Your Name, Ghibli films, Attack On Titan, etc would stay strong and maybe even be higher.

Final Fantasy XIV... still, NMS pulled off one **hell** of a redemption arc.

Speaking of hell -and leaving aside P5R for a second, since a better version of my game of the generation will, naturally, be on the undisputed top-, Hades was the absolute best game I've played last year.

No game, not even TLOU2 or Ghost, with its well deserved victory, comes even close to the amount of polish, dedication and care Supergiant Games put into Hades. Not only is a blast to play but it also masterfully flips the rogue-lite genre on its head by integrating narrative and making death, a thing feared on the genre, something you start looking forward. There's always something new to discover after each run, be it a new perk, weapon, character building dialogue or story beat.

fqaahum,t3_ghnvc0,"I appreciate that you made a post about this and after looking through the evidence you provided, I can't in good faith defend DW or T-M for this. I hope T-M will address this and soon.

However, I also find your post to be low-quality for two reasons. One is that it links to too many other things that are not actually all that relevant. You did not have to link both the books and the publisher's website, when the link to the books are on that same website anyway, and listing all these editions are not relevant enough to be in the main body. They should, funnily enough, be included as reference in a footnote instead. Likewise, all the links to various tweets regarding this topic clog up your post and makes it annoying to sift through and should've been a footnote too for people who are curious. 

The second reason I find your post to be low quality, and I consider this far more damaging, is that a good chunk of your post just covers how underwhelmed fans felt this particular Lostbelt. Frankly it is not relevant because regardless of how well or badly written this Lostbelt is, that does not justify plagiarism in a professional, commercial product. What's the point of namedropping some English twitter users and linking to their thoughts about how boring Olympus was? Why dedicate an afterword to showing how people think Romulus=Quirinus is boring? It's irrelevant, and more than that it's damaging. Look at how a bunch of responses here start with defending Grand Romulus, and how many of those don't seem to consider the plagiarism to be a big deal. Whether it's intentional or not, due to all these other superfluous things you added to your post, you have helped to detract from the actual issue at hand.",suoukun,,78,78,2020-05-11 16:48:30

fq9synu,t3_ghnvc0,"Is this merely ethical issue? or is there something much more substantial?

From what I understand, the copying is one or two sentences. Not a whole paragraph or a page.

Copying sentences directly for your paper from literature (book, paper. etc) is a big no no in academic society. Even if you cite the source, you still have to paraphrase. Unless it is a direct quote that you want to address in your paper.

But a video game? It is an entertainment media. It is like Total War quoting dialogues from Divine Comedy.

The worst judgment for the writer, from my understanding, is “you’re lazy”.

fqa3896,t3_ghnvc0,"This is definitely something that feels iffy to me.

I know how sacred citations are when it comes to academic stuff, but at the same time it being used as a quick historic summary for fictional characters also makes me want to brush it off.

I just kind of feel torn. If you’re gonna be so lazy as to copy paste the passages, i see the point of just putting citations to the source there since it just feels scummy. But at the same time, citing every book and writer for the pure historical bits of characters for a game that’s there mostly to provide some context to irl history compared to whatever made up history TM then makes also feels a bit much. It would definitely feel weird to have names of random writers and books everywhere in the profiles.

Maybe i can see it being done better in the mats. And i guess it’s not like FGO doesn’t give back to these kind of works, since books related to servants have flown off the shelf by using the FGO characters to promote them. Maybe that would’ve been better? Contacting the writers specifically, and set up a cross promotion while not filling up the profile with citations.

-

For the Olympus bits, i agree that it was disappointing. In regards to how it handled the overarching story beats and characters of FGO part 2, i think they did well. We see a lot of progress there. But i feel the story and characters of ‘Olympus’ itselfs suffers, if you get what i mean.

The gods that we basically rush through aren’t that interesting and developed tbh, and well in regards ro the ‘grand boring’ thing i aslo think our support line up was real questionable this time.

I feel like making musashi the ‘main’ helper was a mistake. We already went through a whole chapter with her, she didn’t need that much more development. It’s such a waste when the helper role is usually the time where characters can get the most developments. We had sane caligula, but he barely said and did anything. So forgettable he wasn’t even on the chapter completion CE.

I feel like caligula and maybe also normal romulus should’ve been the main helper along musashi, so that when the finale came and grand lancer appeared it would’ve meant something. If i had to compare it with camelot, musashi should’ve been the ‘arash’ or ‘CA’ of the story instead of the ‘bedi’.",Dragonsoldier77,,51,51,2020-05-11 15:47:03

But citing everything they have used every time they push out a new story or servant is a bit much, especially when Servants are often just caricatures that aren't true to life or literature.

But when sentences or whole passages are copied and pasted 'word for word', that's when you need to follow due protocol.

I hope they can also start citing when releasing mat books. I understand it might be a pain for the previous ones but it’s never too late to start making amends

The disconnect between Olymp and Atlantis hurt them, but that was the only thing out of their hands. The Greek mecha God takedowns being repetitive, Zeus getting no big moment and winding up as a midboss, Roma having an awkward design made by 2 people combined and doing 2 things before dying immediately, every story-beat having a lengthy explanation, both twins being extremely one-note, and the boring prose and writing style are all legitimate judgments.",PkFreezeAlpha,,9,9,2020-05-11 15:51:22

fqcqqss,t3_ghnvc0," 

This whole thing reminds me of Shimousa=Makai Tensho controversy.  
Sure,plagarism is wrong but i wonder if Homer,the original author really care about it.  
The book has been translated to multiple languages and truth to be told,this ain't a scientific Master/PHD paper where citation from original work NEEDS to be done or else,your paper worth nothing and can cause you problems down the line.  
If we need to citate every fiction sources in the world,i don't think fiction will be as prominent as it is today.  
Nasu are also known to 'plagarize'(homage) multiple other people's work such as Saint Seiya,Star Wars and hell,even the history of King Arthur itself,with a twist of changing gender and some minute details.  
Imitation is sincerest form of flattery,i say.  
In context of Dioscouri,i need to ask.  
Does the plagarized line change the intent of the work?If it's not,i am pretty sure those who involved in the original translation of the work have a ground for copyright infringement and can sue TM/DW for this.If it is,then it can be considered as a 'homage' since fiction works often citate original works in a way that it does not affect the original works in a negative way.As a matter of fact,some people might go out of their way to buy the original works as demonstrated by people in charge of selling historical books using FGO characters to sell it.  
Are you here for the original work or reimagined Dioscouri themselves?  
If you are here for original work(which is kind of weird but hey,in some cases it did happen),then i dunno.Sue DW/TM.  
If you are here for Pollux's ass and hips,then i don't think it will became a case of plagarism,since the intent of the work have already been changed.  
If you stand by the fact that plagarism is bad and TM/DW need to get their shit together,then by all means stand for it.  
I personally didn't care and i have better things to do than getting outraged since i am pretty sure TM themself wouldn't care until a lawsuit came to their office.

f8znl6o,t3_e2za6v,"Saying turn-based JRPGs are not being made anymore is definitely just plain wrong. 

However, it is also true that real-time combat has become as prevalent if not more than turn-based.

Off the top of my head, I'd say the biggest JRPG franchises active right now are: Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Pokemon, Tales, Xenoblade, Shin Megami Tensei (including Persona) and Fire Emblem.

Pokemon and Fire Emblem, however, really aren't the same kind of game as the rest, so let's put them apart for the sake making things clearer.

Only one of the remaining 5 franchises began as an action RPG, and that is the Tales series. Xenogears and Xenosaga, spiritual predecessors to the Xenoblade games, were all Turn-Based.

Now, 3 out of 5 have real-time combat in their latest games and only Dragon Quest and SMT/Persona games remain as truly ""big budget"" turn-based JRPGs - although it's impossible to predict what kind of combat system will be in the next numbered Final Fantasy game. 

Another thing, of these 5 franchises the ones that offer the closest experience to the ""golden era"" games as far as setting, structure, etc., are Dragon Quest and Tales.

Meaning that - despite the fact the Tales series doesn't have turn-based combat - if you want to play a game closest to, let's say, a modern day Final Fantasy 4, you are better off playing the latest Tales game than the latest Final Fantasy, and this has been true for some time now.

All this being said, what I really take issue with is the notion that games from way back when were better in general - or that they had better combat systems.

Some people really seem to look at the past with extremely rose tinted glasses. The fact many people will readily mention Legend of Dragoon as one of the classic JRPGs should be enough proof of that.",,,71,71,2019-11-28 17:39:31

I seperated the original 3DS releases as many here probably dont have a 3DS, those games are hard to get on other devices and to highlight what an absolutely amazing JRPG Device the 3DS is even now after its run. I highly recommend one.

Still 24 Home Console/Pc JRPGs and 12 3DS Jrpgs in five years is plenty. Cant really see why anyone would say the genre is doing badly, thats more than five games a year, many of them good.

I'm sure if you used that same time frame in any time within 1995-2009, you could find a much better list with lots of classics. And I'm giving that time frame just because I'm not very familiar with SNES games, but I know there's a lot of classics there too.

* Valkyrie Profile

With the exception of the Lunar series, I believe most of these games were released in a 3 year period from 1997-1999, and this isn't account for some other titles that are often beloved on this sub but left off because they're not strictly turn-based (Vandal Hearts, FF Tactics, Parasite Eve, Tales of Destiny)

What do all of these games have in common? We can boil down some commonalities:

1. Mature storylines
2. Generally epic scope (Big world, lots of travel, many locations)
3. Most were ""Big"" RPG franchises for their respective developers.

Many of these games also pushed what the hardware could do at the time and had what would be considered ""AAA"" graphics back then. Let's also clarify what they're not:

1. They're not handheld titles.
2. They're not dungeon crawlers.
3. They're not mobile RPGs
4. They're not monster collection (Pokemon/Digimon).
5. They're not deliberately focused around the sexualization and infantilization of their female cast (waifu/harem games)

A staggering amount of games in OP's list vanishes into the aether if you apply these filters, and we're left with 

* Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE
* Persona 5
* I am Setsuna
* Dragon Quest XI
* Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III/IV
* Octopath Traveler

This is where things start breaking down into personal taste, but it honestly feels like only Persona 5, DQXI, and Cold Steel can solidly stand next to the golden age games quoted at the top of my list. This is what people mean when they express frustration. JRPG aren't the killer, console graphic-selling genre anymore with the best stories anymore. That's what we want developers to give us again.

f91f8qq,t3_e2za6v,"When I saw that other topic, I understood something different than most of the other commenters. For context, I had just finished watching a review of Pokemon SwSh, in which the reviewer addresses Pokemon's unchanged formula, and how it has stayed in the past in comparison with other franchises. 
 
And that's what I thought the last topic was about. The OP was pointing the lack of modern jrpgs, but not modern as in recent but as in innovative and with a modern take on the turn-based formula. And in that sense, I have to agree a bit. While there are some amazing games that have spiced the turn-base combat a bit (among my favourites are Super Robot Wars OG's juggling mechanic, Tokyo Mirage Sessions' joint performances and Radiant Historia's grid-based combat), I think they are not that common. But I may be wrong! Sadly, I haven't keep up to date with all newly released games. 
 
Rather than a list of all turn-based jrpgs, I would prefer to see a list of innovative (as in, spicing the formula a bit) jrpgs released in the past 5 years.  
 
Just to note, I don't think that a simple turn-base system is bad. Digimon Cyber-Sleuth and the Atelier games are like that, and I love them. It's just that after 25-something years playing jrpgs, I want something new.",Yukito01,,5,5,2019-11-29 00:43:33

Shawn Michaels would be a full-time performer from August 2002 (Summerslam) to March/April 2010 (Wrestlemania), but he would have lengthy breaks of several months off in 2004, 2007, and 2009.

He wrestled around 100 matches in both 2005 and 2006. He wrestled between 40-80 matches a year from 2003-04 and 2007-09. In 2010, he wrestled 25 matches including his retirement match against The Undertaker.

While Shawn Michaels didn't wrestle as much as he did in his first run with WWF/WWE (he had 172 matches in 1996 alone), it's a miracle Shawn was able to come back in 2002 and have a great 8-year run after his severe back injury and overcoming his personal issues.",James1DPP,,5,5,2020-10-07 21:04:21

h6szxyy,t3_oszgv2,"Reading some of the responses in this and other threads is quite disheartening. Simone Biles has been one of the top athletes in the world for years, has collected gold medals en masse and has achieved things most others couldn't even dream of - and people drop her like an ugly baby the moment she shows any sign of weakness.

People need to understand that Gymnastics is one of the most dangerous sports out there. It's something you can only really do if you feel on the top of your game and have utmost confidence in your abilities. A ""bad day"", a bad landing can ruin or even end your life.

Comparing this to your job at home or some other athletes like Tom Brady is therefore pretty ridiculous. What's the worst that would happen to Tom Brady when he has a bad day? He might miss a pass or two. He's not going to break his neck.

Also the accusations of being a quitter and the claims that ""quitting is for the weak"" and ""you should never quit"" are quite nonsensical in my mind. Knowing when to quit, judging when a risk is just not worth taking is one of the most important skills in life.

I was disappointed myself when Simone dropped out of the competition. I'm not even American, but I do enjoy watching the best. But she did it - probably knowing how the reaction at home would look like - because she thought it would be the best decision for the team, and I respect her for that.",ETAHoffmann,,5,5,2021-07-28 07:26:45

Regardless of how strong you think you are or how strong someone is, no one is immune to these kinds of struggles and deserves compassion. 

I also wonder what this upbringing via a strict sport mentality does to athletes when they deal with non-athletes in everyday life. I've only known one ""top"" athlete, let's say (she was about as high as you go in her sport without being a professional or an Olympian), and she was one of the least compassionate and most callous people I've known whenever the people in our orbit were struggling or acted in ways she didn't approve of. I don't want my experience with her to taint how I could view athletes as people, should I ever meet others around her level, but it does leave me wondering how common her pov is for people in her sport and in sports at large.

We need reform all around when it comes to having these discussions. It's sad to see these athletes struggling as they're so close to reaching their dreams, but it's a step in the right direction.",,,1,1,2021-07-28 01:26:21

This is just to say that mental health issues is something going on outside of superstars like Osaka and Biles, and that there’s probably hundreds of similar stories that you’ll never hear of.

nrkjxk,,A comprehensive breakdown of every game under Nintendo's first and second party studios.,Animegamingnerd,,508,0.94,2021-06-03 18:38:00
h0h1rtf,t3_nrkjxk,"A few things I'd like to add on to this.

1. Nintendo EPD is divided into 10 main divisions (along with a mobile games division), which are each responsible for either Internal or External R&D. 
   1. EPD1, EPD2, EPD6, and EPD7 are External R&D. These divisions help affiliate and 3rd party developers with game development, but aren't typically responsible for developing their own games. 
   2. EPD3, EPD4, EPD5, EPD8, EPD9, and EPD10 are Internal R&D. These divisions work on their own games in-house.
      1. EPD3 is the Zelda team. Currently working on Breath of the Wild 2.
      2. EPD4 is responsible for a lot of the random ""oddity"" games. Think Ring Fit Adventure and Labo. Currently working on Game Builder Garage.
      3. EPD5 is responsible for Animal Crossing and Splatoon. Currently working on Splatoon 3.
      4. EPD8 is the 3D Mario team. There are rumors that the team working on Donkey Kong are an offshoot of this team, with younger developers at the helm, rather than devoting the entirety of the Odyssey team to the project. Current project is unknown, but the rumors are pointing towards the aforementioned Donkey Kong and most likely the next 3D Mario title.
      5. EPD9 is the Mario Kart and ARMS team. Current project is unknown, but is speculated to be the next Mario Kart title.
      6. EPD10 is the 2D Mario and Pikmin team. Current project is unknown, but the next mainline 2D Mario game and Pikmin 4 could be possibilities.
2. Grezzo is another important 2nd party developer for Nintendo. They do a lot of work with remakes and ports, such as Link's Awakening and the Zelda 3DS ports. They helped out on Miitopia, but it's unlikely that commanded a significant amount of attention. Given their familiarity with the series, they could be helping out with potential Zelda 35th Anniversary titles, such as Ocarina/Majora Switch ports.
3. Another important 2nd party developer is Good-Feel. They're the ones behind Yoshi's Crafted World, Yoshi's Woolly World, and Kirby's Epic Yarn. Current project is unknown.
4. I hesitate to call MercurySteam a 2nd party developer, but given the numerous rumors of them working on the next Metroid game, I think they deserve a mention.
5. Beyond Bandai Namco and Koei Tecmo, Nintendo also has a pretty strong relationship with Platinum. Bayonetta 3 is likely their next Switch title, and Astral Chain 2 could be int he pipeline as well.
6. Nintendo's strongest 3rd party ties seem to be with Atlus (Shin Megami Tensei), Grasshopper Manufacture (No More Heroes), and Square Enix (Team Asano titles).",,,184,184,2021-06-03 18:56:20

Path of Radiance is my 2nd favorite game of all time (the first being Guild Wars 1, by the way), and it deserves to be affordably experienced by a new audience on modern hardware.

Their April events were cancelled due to poor ticket sales, and the XPW owners would be arrested on Federal obscenity charges around the same time.

>WWA's latest PPV in Glasgow, Scotland saw Lex Luger defeat Sting to win the WWA title in a short, terrible match that was basically botched from start to finish.

WWA doesn't last much longer either. They do one more tour Australia in May 2003. The WWA International Cruiserweight Title is merged with the NWA TNA X Division Title, and the WWA World Title is merged with the NWA World Title at WWA The Reckoning in May 2003. That would be the final show.",James1DPP,,3,3,2020-12-24 02:46:08

For those new to NJPW I would add that IWGP stands for ""*International Wrestling Grand Prix*"" to further flesh that part out and maybe add an American equivalent like the NWA titles being the championships in Jim Crockett Promotions & TNA: *Total Nonstop Action* Wrestling as the NWA was the governing body both promotions operated under to maybe help some people out who don't understand why NJPW's top titles are IWGP.  Comparing to an American equivalent may help those who are completely new and taking in all this information about the promotion for the first time.

You put in a lot of time and work on this.  Kudos to you, sir.

i656h1s,t3_ubhzvs,"First and foremost, great writeup OP! I'm going to put an explanation I wrote up earlier about the Dontaku card.

Kazuchika Okada (c) vs Tetsuya Naito for the IWGP World Heavyweight Title: Naito didn't win when he challenged in February but then he pinned Okada in the Semi-Finals of the New Japan Cup (via roll-up) so now he has right to challenge for their third match of the year and I believe 12th all time but I may be wrong. Naito has made it his mission to get back to the Tokyo Dome main event after he finally achieved the glory of standing atop the pedestal of New Japan at Wrestle Kingdom 14, completing a 5+ year arc. Naito has kept coming close but never getting the cigar as he took Okada to his absolute limit at the finale of the New Japan Golden Series for the IWGP Heavyweight Title and then the aformentionted New Japan Cup win which led to him losing in the final because he tried to slow the pace too much which hurt him since the longer he waited the more his knee starts to give out. Oh, that's something to mention, Naito's knee is kind of giving out on him (mix of kayfabe & reality). Naito has to deal with the sad fact that right when he finally finished his arc and his emotional state was at it's best (and thus in the best position to win), his body is giving out. Furthermore, Naito has for a while said he would consider retirement at 40 (unclear if this is work or shoot) so that's another reason why he desperately wants to be in the main event of Tokyo Dome again. Okada as the ace of New Japan has been on a mission to prove himself as the greatest of all time during the 50th anniversary. He was going for the Triple Crown (New Japan Cup, G1 and holding the IWGP Heavyweight Title at the end of the year) but he failed to capture that in the Cup. So now he has 2 priorities, hold onto the belt and prepare for the G1 which he aims to win.

Hiroshi Tanahashi vs Will Ospreay for the vacant IWGP US Title: Sanada was forced to vacate after Ospreay broke his orbital bone during the New Japan Cup. Sanada wanted Tanahashi to have it since Tanahashi is a legend and was the champ before Sanada but Ospreay declared that since he not only had the right to challenge because he beat the champ but also because he was the man who forced Sanada to vacate, that he should have it)

El Desperado (c) vs Taiji Ishimori for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Title: So Bullet Club is kind of split into two sub factions, Bullet Club & House of Torture, they are aligned but have a bit of inner tension. The junior of House of Torture, SHO, challenged at Hyper Battle after attacking Desperado during and after matches multiple times during the New Japan Cup Tour. Then after Phantasmo & Ishimori lost in humiliating fashion to 6 or 9 for the IWGP Jr. Tag Titles (featuring one of my favorite commentary lines ""some unwilling 69ing from 6 or 9!""), Phantasmo told Ishimori to go challenge for the jr. title (quote ""fuck house of torture"").EVIL (c) vs Tama Tonga for the NEVER Openweight Title: Jay White kicked Tama & his brother, Tanga, out of Bullet Club but White couldn't go back to Japan yet due to visa stuff. So, White's biggest advocate/manager type in Bullet Club, Gedo, went around trying to see where everyone was aligned, pressuring them in. Then the New Japan Cup bracket worked out so that House of Torture guys were facing Tama and/or Tanga. Then it came time for Tama to face EVIL. It looked like Tama would win but Dick Togo (curse that man) pulled the ref out making the allegiance of House of Torture clear, they side with White. Ishimori & Phantasmo ran out after the match to save Tama but then they turned on him right away which led to all of Bullet Club running down to join the beatdown, no one had sided with GOD (Tama & Tanga). Then Jado ran in (Gedo's best friend and tag partner for 30 years) and he saved GOD (or at least tried to he was overwhelmed very quickly). So the lines were drawn and it was stacked against Jado & GOD. At Hyper Battle after EVIL defeated his old stablemate, Hiromu Takahashi to retain the title, Tama ran down, attacking EVIL, and issuing the challenge for Dontaku.United Empire (Jeff Cobb & Great O-Khan) (c) vs Bishamon (Hirooki Goto & Yoshi-Hashi) vs Bullet Club (Bad Luck Fale & Chase Owens) for the IWGP Heavyweight Tag Titles: Cobb & O-Khan of Will Ospreay's stable, United Empire, challenged Bishamon at Hyper Battle for the tag titles after Cobb beat Yoshi-Hashi in the New Japan Cup. Cobb & O-Khan won the match, becoming the new tag champs and giving O-Khan his first ever IWGP Title. During their post match comments, Cobb & O-Khan boasted about how great they are and how any team can come from far and wide (in fact I think he called out FTR), then Owens & Fale who had expressed their desire to go for the tag titles earlier, walked in but so did Bishamon. Bishamon wanted a rematch.. Owens & Fale told them to get to the back of the line and made their own challenge.

6 or 9 (Ryusuke Taguchi & Master Wato) (c) vs Suzuki-gun (Yoshinobu Kanemaru & DOUKI) for the IWGP Junior Tag Titles: 6 or 9 is the team of an up and coming young guy (Wato) and a veteran (Taguchi). They are a comedy team but Wato has been showing more fire and ring prowess lately and despite his comedy stuff, Taguchi used to be one of the top guys in the junior divison. Kanemaru was a legendary junior in NOAH but hasn't found the same sucess in NJPW. DOUKI is kind of the bottom of the Suzuki-gun totem pole, he is seen almost like a little brother by Zack Sabre Jr. He is a bit strange, carrying around his walking stick and with his odd mask & face paint but he is a lovely lower mid-card wrestler in my opinion. Kanemaru & DOUKI attacked Wato & Taguchi during their post match comments after they defended the belts against Phantasmo & Ishimori at Hyper Battle. They yelled at them, ""you know what this means"" and funnily Taguchi, kind of wasted and overall just confused was grabbing Wato asking what it means and what they want.Yujiro Takahashi vs Tanga Loa: Earlier I told you about the whole thing that went down between GOD & Bullet Club. Yujiro is a member of the House of Torture (probably the lowest on the House of Torture totem pole aside from Togo who doesn't wrestle super often) and one of the men involved in the many beatdowns of GOD.

YOH vs Hiromu Takahashi: Yoh used to be part of the top junior tag team in NJPW, Roppongi 3K but they broke up when SHO turned on him. YOH has seemed to have lost his way, his natural confidence and with it his fire for wrestling. But then he broke that streak put on a massive winning streak in last year's Best of the Super Juniors, losing to Hiromu in the final but that match was incredible (aside from when SHO attacked both of them trying to force a no contest which was refuse) and YOH came very close to victory (which would have been his first over Hiromu ever). But Hiromu was able to triumphant, although event though both of them were affected the same physically by SHO's attack, the mental impact on YOH can't be denied. YOH has not performed well in 2022 thus far, his fire seems to be lost, he was finally beginning to stabilize his violate emotional state but then SHO through a wrench in things again, he hasn't done anything of note, he's just been plodding along, sure he got to fight in the New Japan Cup but he exited first round, sure he has been in a ton of big time tag matches (IWGP Title previews) but he hasn't begun anything meaningful out of them, he has not fulfilled his potential. Meanwhile, Hiromu has been doing everything he can, he loves wrestling and sometimes his motives seem a bit sporadic, but he is always doing something, always giving 110%, always has his heart on his sleeve. He made an epic run in the New Japan Cup, despite only being a junior and having a tough road. So these, two men with polar opposite 2022's faced each other in a tag preview for Okada vs Naito (Naito & Hiromu vs Okada & YOH). After the match, Hiromu called out YOH, I suggest watching it, it starts around 12:30 and ends around 19:00 but you could also watch the whole video if you'd like [https://njpwworld.com/p/s\_series\_00608\_1\_bs](https://njpwworld.com/p/s_series_00608_1_bs)

Los Ingornobles De Japon (Shingo Takagi & BUSHI) & Tatsumi Fujinami vs Suzuki-gun (Taichi, Zack Sabre Jr & TAKA Michinoku): This year is NJPW's 50th anniversary so they are having a lot of legend tag matches at big events to show this stuff off. In this case, Tatsumi Fujinami is the NJPW legend. He hasn't wrestled in NJPW for a good bit and I'll be honest I haven't seen his stuff as I haven't watched much of past NJPW but it should be a fun opener. It was originally supposed to be Hiromu, Takagi & Fujinami but then Hiromu vs Yoh got added last second so they subbed in BUSHI (the lowest on the totem pole of LIJ) I'm not sure why LIJ vs Suzuki-gun was chosen specifically though if I had to guess it's because Taichi and Takagi are in a quick feud over the King of Pro Wrestling Trophy, which Taichi is trying to make more prestigous.

i64tl5z,t3_ubhzvs,"Thank you so much. What I’m doing is I’m watching it on the Roku Channel (they are replays but I’m slowly getting into it) my dad saw the Will Ospreay vs Hiromu Takahashi and he was just in shock. My dad is a old school Puerto Rico fan but haven’t watched wrestling with me since 2006 (WWE product was dying) and when I introduced him to AEW, he was also in shock with all these wrestlers, the moves, promos, the attitude vibes and now he watches it with me and he is compromised. Now he is Excited for NJPW and he is 57 years old and he saw Wrestlemania and he only liked the Cody vs Seth, Knoxville vs Sami and Brock vs Roman, the only complain was that Brock vs Roman match was short and he doesn’t like the commentary table because it doesn’t sound “professional” and more into influencers and Social Media and Money related and towards the youth of now days. He wasn’t feeling it but he respects the company but the product is not for us the Old School.

Otherwise, awesome writeup! The one minor critique I might have is calling Suzuki-Gun a ""heel"" faction, because ""faces"" and ""heels"" can be fluid in New Japan.

I would argue the only ""true"" heels are Bullet Club. Suzuki-Gun and UE are maybe more 'tweener-ish in that they can be bullies they often wind up being the fan favorites in some scenarios (i.e. especially against Bullet Club). UE in particular doesn't really cheat to win and they have a strong fan following. They definitely lean heel, but it really all depends on their storyline at any given moment.",darthsabbath,,4,4,2022-04-25 17:51:44

igd2uzy,t3_w09id2,"PS: This was a rather nasty way to realise reddit posts had a 40k character limit ahahahaha. I can't even put this PS in the actual post. It took so much just to cut it down to this level.

But yeah, this took a lot of effort, but as such that just means it has even more places where I might have missed something, overlooked someone, or straight up gotten some information wrong. So please let me know if there's anything I've missed or forgotten.

My knowledge of Strong for example is ridiculously little, as these last few years of my life have been far too hectic to follow much other than New Japan's core. So most of the info on Strong has been provided by others, and I can't thank them enough for that.

I really want this to be an easy to use, access and understand resource for anyone looking at getting into the company, so any help or even spotlight I can get on this would be much appreciated.

And of course, for anyone new who wants to know more, feel free to ask any questions you want. Can't always promise an answer, but it's good to get more info out there.",Shuriken95,,36,36,2022-07-16 06:01:33

Also also, by sheer coincidence, it seems like /u/costal_signals has actually just posted a full primer on the G1 that goes a little more in-depth on the context for each of the wrestlers involved.

igd8nya,t3_w09id2,"Additional introductory resources: 

* **The Recount**: An official Youtube series on NJPW's English-language YT account that details many various parts of New Japan history. Examples include a series on [the history of Bullet Club,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFb8Dxypi00&list=PLuY6JE3lpYAOcId_BCad-4hE8N-da2f1G) running through each of its eras, a similar series on [the history of CHAOS,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjmVQpBy62M&list=PLuY6JE3lpYAOdzDz5rLM6zdRDshVdhKzP) and a series on [the history of the G1.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S366sKirFNE)

* **Showbuckle**: So unfortunately, one of the worst parts of having a Japanese television deal for your product is that draconic copyright laws in Japan make it such that anything a fan puts on Youtube that has any footage whatsoever gets taken down. One of the biggest and best examples of this is Showbuckle, who had an excellent series of videos that were basically required viewing for introducing western fans to the company back in 2017-2018, especially with New Japan themselves not doing much at the time to supplement background information in English. His Youtube may no longer be around, but his vids are [archived on IA](https://archive.org/details/showbuckle-pack) and, while some have aged a little and aren't quite as relevant anymore, others are still some of the best video essay content you will find on New Japan. (In part because people know they can't really upload such stuff on New Japan right now anymore.) 
Some of his best work includes:
    * *""The Tale of the Golden Lovers""* - a vid about the one-of-a-kind relationship between Kenny Omega and Kota Ibushi. 
    * *The Triumph of New Japan's Young Lion System* - self explanatory.
    * *NJPW's sublime video production style* - a vid that goes into the details of why New Japan's highly-lauded camerawork is so good.
    * *The Rise and Fall of Tetsuya Naito* - the only vid I had to make sure was in the main post, because it really is essential viewing imo. 
    * All of his vids. Seriously, they're just great introductory viewing for New Japan, and it's a massive shame that he got taken down, never to make a New Japan vid again.
* **Chris Charlton** - The man who long served as a Japanese-English translator for New Japan, and who now has even been upgraded to a role as co-commentator to Kevin Kelly, also happens to be the biggest English language historian of NJPW, and he has multiple books on not just NJPW history, but even the history of Japanese wrestling as a whole, such as *Eggshells* which details the stories of wrestling within the Tokyo Dome. If you want background context or the winding threads of long-term narrative that New Japan is well-known for, this is a man to follow.",Shuriken95,,24,24,2022-07-16 07:10:07

As far as faction goes, I have taken an early liking for LIJ. AFAIK, they seem to have a very unique dynamic with having two ""top guys"" in Shingo and Naito.

h00pbv4,t3_nogneu,"Thank you to King for such an amazing rate!!! Those shitposts are god-tier! I hate to be the whoever the host is to follow you up :grinny:

Anyways, for stats here are the [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=28287180) and [leaderboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) like always!!

##Songs

Well who saw this coming. **XS** sweeps the competition. It lands on the highest rated songs of all time top 25 leaderboard at #23. It also takes a spot on the most 11's leaderboard at #5 with an amazing 34!

**Ungodly Hour** also gets a stellar score and lands at #47 for highest song averages (not enough for the leaderboard unfortunately) and #11 for most 11's! (which IS enough for the leaderboard!)

##Artists

I think most people thought this would be **Rina's** rate to lose and it turns out they were right! She pretty much swept the competition and the scores really show it. Rina's rate results move her into the top 25 for highest artist averages at #23! 

For the only rate newcomers, **CxH** knocked it out of the park. They enter the artist averages at #27/258 with a stellar 8.099! Their records with Ungodly Hours' title track are also amazing. 

Despite the beating **Charli** endured on day 1, she managed to avoid a total bloodbath on day 2 but unfortunately day 3 wasn't enough to save her. She is one of the 6 artists to lose their whole album before the top 10 (in the 5th earliest exit at #12). Charli also moves into the top 10 for most artist 11's at 5th (with 167) and onto the leaderboard for most artist 0's also at 5th (with 98)! Charli is also now tied for 1st with Beyonce for most Popheads rate appearances at 17 each!! Will Sweetnermore 2 push this to 18? Or are we cursed to never get it?

This sub really said **Carly** was more outmatched that Bebe Rexha and Bionic in their rates. She becomes the 2nd earliest exit in a 4 album rate (after Drake with his near-unbeatable out in 25th place record). Carly also moves up records for 6th most songs rated from 10th (73 -> 85).

Also while Carly and Charli both seemed to be destroyed, their scores actually matched up similarly to their previous rates. Carly's average only dropped by about 0.005 and Charli's average actually rose a little! They just had the misfortune of going up against two stellar albums.

##Albums

~~Probably Sawayama idk~~

So definitely **Sawayama** it seems! It ends up with an absolutely stellar 8.336 which puts it at #14 on the leaderboards for highest album average!

**Ungodly Hour** got an amazing average too, but not enough to make the leaderboards (though it should show up on the top 100 made by Niki)

##Rate

This rate turned out to be the 3rd most participated rate!! It also makes it onto the list of most songs to receive someone's 11 at #6 with 77.55% of the songs picking at least one up!!

speaking of rates, I've heard there are some fantastic ones open right now! [Video game vocals](https://redd.it/n3ilq2) is due in 2 weeks and [Breakup Pop Rock](https://redd.it/n3ikze) is due about a week after that! Please do them both!!!",TiltControls,,23,23,2021-05-30 22:07:45

I think this is one of the weaker tracks on UH and it's still this fucking strong, as an opener it packs a hell of a punch, and I'm obsessed with Chloe singing ""you must got me fucked up"". I remember the video for this dropping with/just before the album and replaying it obsessively, they looked so good.

---

# im not sure i actually know what the fifth amendment is

**1998tweety** (10): Amazing. I already wrote about the song here for our top 100 songs of 2020 so I'll just link that (it deserved higher though).

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): This album has a really strong start and Forgive Me showcases the strengths in the girls' vocal delivery and catchy instrumentals

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The way they go off! It’s absolute perfection.

**akanewasright** (10): This song only just now clicked for me. It’s honestly such a perfect vibe

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic intro!!!! Gorgeous song. The delivery is very beyoncé. Like mother like dorters

**brenda\_official** (10): DETONATE THE YASS GRENADE

**Brendon-Urine** (10): It's a perfect song, in any other rate this is probably my 11 (but there are ~5 charli songs in front lolololol). also the music video is so fucking beautiful

**conceptualromance** (10): this shit is in different areas!! This is literally a perfect song.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i will be cross referencing the chromatica ii/911 scores to make sure no one is underscoring this

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): the intro is so ethereal and angelic. The song is really great Introduction to the album about becoming an adult even while it’s centered around a soured relationship. Also I love melodrama.

**EnCaine** (10): perfect opener

**endcreditouilles** (10): this transition is fucking heaven. I wish these two tracks were combined into one song on the album. I can never put this album on shuffle bc it feels like a crime to stream one without the other

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): yes, this is just hella good esp the bridge

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love the transition from the intro to the song to the song so much. And everything about Forgive Me is just perfection with the build up and harmonies

**iniekcja\_** (10): an absolutely perfect introduction

**jaztinax** (10): queen behavior through and through

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): THOSE VIOLINS, THAT TRANSITION

**musical\_pyn** (10): what an incredible way to start an album

**nootnoot781** (10): what a way to start your album. they both demolished the track

**notarobot3675** (10): my favourite song on this album! ive been obsessed, i mean that bridge alone

**plastichaxan** (10): the transition pushed this from a 9.8 to a 10 for me lol

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): haunting, gorgeous, amazing, talented, never been done before, i cannot deal with the harmonies. the lyrics. the anger. the absolute body covering chills when those strings come in. i do not know what they are saying the whole song but girl i feel your pain! fuck that man!

**ReallyCreative** (10): me when I die and it turns out God is real and he isn't with the whole gay sex thing

**Roxieloxie** (10): im literally obsessed with them

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the intro leading up into the song gives me chills! they brought the drama with this one and I’m here for it

**seanderlust** (10): ""I love it because it’s so badass, and it’s taking your power back and not feeling like your self-worth is in the trash"" - Chloe about this song, which I fully agree with

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the transition should be talked about more, it was so good

**SupremeShani** (10): I fully came into this rate ready to defend the literal seconds that was Intro, but I'm happy that it was combined with Forgive Me. The vocals and atmosphere here are so hauntingly beautiful, with the production being open and airy while still having each note be perfectly incorporated, which I think just really does a stellar job opening the album.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): one of my favourite openers ever. the intro is just pure stunning vocals and then forgive me GOES OFF especially the outro omg

**throwaway7650** (10): don't ever ask for permission... ask for forgiveness. iconic. adding the intro pushes forgive me to a 10

**Vultuxe** (10): Forgive Me is an excellently crafted pop song, it should have taken off instead of Do It. The hook and their voices are just enthralling, the production hits just right -- there is not a flaw in this song.

**waluigiest** (10): ask for forgiveness violin frenzy I die instantly

**wavingwolves** (10): LIE-LIE-LIE-LIE-LIE-LIE-LIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!

**xaviersi** (10): honestly best intro and song to set the vibe for the whole album and the intro incorporates my favorite saying

**fenellabeach** (9.7): ethereal and a perfect intro

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): Intro > Chromatica II

**juanolsen** (9.6): the transition between this two songs make my buddy throbe

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): I don’t know what it is exactly, but there’s something about the verses that just make me think of Beyoncé.

**artzpop** (9.5): this is what plays when you enter the gates of heaven. A place many of you will not be seeing.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Iconic intro. Her voice in that first line, uhhhh. Forgive me for not giving it a 10, but it ends so abruptly that it actually makes me mad.

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Intro is gorgeous and transitions so well. Forgive Me slaps especially the outro. LIE LIE LIE LIE LIE

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Their vocals are always stunning but something about their performance on this song specifically I love

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): this gives me disney princess vibes in the best way possible

**zagreux** (9.5): Gosh. The intro mercilessly scalped my wig, and girl, the transition into Forgive ME?!?!!?!?!!?!?!?

**anothertown** (9): You must got me fucked up. You must got me fucked up

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Thank you for grouping these two together lol.

**camerinian** (9): the bounce on this is so much fun

**Dekubaku** (9): Love their voice!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): A perfect song to open this amazing album. Gosh, their vocals are so heavenly.

**fairytalehigh** (9): The way they sing ""Best believe I'll move on to better things"" ????

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Tbh this grew off me a bit, but still great, and even better with the intro.

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): That. Fucking. Transition. Chloe and Halle’s debut was already a crazy display of raw talent and artistry but they showed from the first 5 minutes of this album that they were A) Not here to play with yall, B) really good at rhythmic humming, C) They can CUSS now yall. I keep forgetting that they’re like my age so it’s kinda weird running into an album that’s basically hitting the same notes of growth/experiences that I’m also going through? Full admission, this album will get an insanely high average from me primarily because of that.

**jayjaysortagay** (9): gaslight gatekeep girlboss

**KennyEarthman** (9): me after using my dad's credit card to buy robux: Don't ever ask for permission, ask for forgiveness

**liberalitea** (9): this is such a smooth, incredible transition. i LOVE CxH vocals and literally just their ""ooh-ing"" in the intro took me placed

**ManofOranges** (9): Very beautiful intro and very beautiful song.

**Oberionsynth** (9): this song is amazing but i just wanna admit that i've thought these girls were twins for as long as i've known about them (2015 ._.)

**Palutzel** (9): it slaps

**poptartchill** (9): such a good transition and I love the production

**pros-and-connors** (9): never has someone saying you got me fucked up sounded more beautiful

**Uberpigeon** (9): Halles high register in the chorus and Chloes delivery in the verses are such a good match, a great track. And the video is really cool.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): “So forgive me, no not really!” UGH this song just hits all the right spots for me! Just think it’s missing one more chorus...

**welcome2thejam** (9): Helluva first track and tone setter. That opening drop kills.",Awkward_King,,9,9,2021-05-30 20:30:07

This is... my most played song on last.fm. By... a considerable amount. This is four of my favourite artists who all evidently injected something fucking insatiably addictive into this remix and god it fucks so hard. Charli does what she does best, elevating the hook to be insanely catchy. Sarah's verse is adorable and I find the little sound effects in the background at the end of the lines a perfect addition, but Rico is in my opinion the star of the song, absolutely killing her verse with no remorse. All laid over what was already a brilliant gecs track. I remember when they played this remix a couple months early at a gig, I replayed that live performance online so many times, and even that didn't take away from how much I looped it when it officially came out. This is an awesome bonus winner, if you can't tell I am very happy.

# 227 plays

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**akanewasright** (10): Literally a perfect collab

**bbfan132** (10): this is the main version of the song

**bespectacIed** (10): excellent remix. rico and sarah devoured

**bigbigbee** (10): Okay so I have to say after a lot of thought, I don’t think that this IMPROVES on the original, if only because the original has Laura’s “I got a little thing for you, I got a little crush or something” bridge. But I LOVE the original and I think this is equally good. Rico’s part is my favorite (which is true for almost anything she’s ever featured on).

**Brendon-Urine** (10): gec

**celladonn** (10): Grateful I can't give 11s to songs in the bonus rate because if I was forced to choose between giving my 11 to this or XS I might actually implode

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Charli, Kero Kero and Rico definitely elevated this track over the original.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Rico ate. Give It's Bugsnax your 10s in VGV.

**EnCaine** (10): everybody here went off but RICO NASTY WENT OFF

**frogaranaman** (10): Charli sounds perfect on this chorus

**geraldinewww** (10): can we PLEASE watch the official lyric video and not the video where dylan and laura hold up pictures on pencils. the pencil one is good but the lyric video is high art

**ggal2020** (10): literally invented music.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Everyone on this kills it

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the best thing 100 gecs have done

**iniekcja\_** (10): gecs

**jasannn** (10): This is peak hyperpop right here.

**jman457** (10): literally invented music

**ManofOranges** (10): Actually amazing to me.

**martian\_pet** (10): 100/100 gecs

**nick1372** (10): this song got me into 100 gecs so thanks for that but also it’s incredible in every way. I love how it twists the original around and each participant here has their own take on the concept.

**pat-rickstar** (10): The 11 of the bonus rate

**pig-serpent** (10): Probably the only remix I can think of that feels like it's meant to be a sequel instead of a replacement, and follows the original really well. Charli is great, but like all her best collabs she gets out of the way to let the other performers steal the show, and holy cow why can't anything else Rico Nasty's done be this good! Would be my 11 in the main rate.

**plastichaxan** (10): it’s litrally my banner… i’d be crazy to give it anything less

**racloves** (10): it just slaps idk what to say

**runaway3212** (10): 10 Tree Of Clues rate when

**seanderlust** (10): this song is a gateway drug into 100 gecs fandom

**SupremeShani** (10): still shook on how all three of them just fit so perfectly here, this song actually inspired me to go out and assign my friends special ringtones like it was the 2000s again

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): He could be in danger, and yet, I still would not save him

**waluigiest** (10): this song made me a gecs believer

**wavingwolves** (10): this is gonna win this bonus rate isn't it

**pros-and-connors** (9.5): shit slaps

**urfavgalpal** (9.5): this is a cute little song and I considered giving it a 10 but then I realized that while this is maybe the more *fun* of the remixes I think the original is actually better.  It’s a tad disjointed, and I’m not the biggest fan of the whisper end.  I mean I do like all the parts.  Each of the verses is really good, but I feel like aside from then “hey Charli can you do the chorus again” there isn’t enough interaction for me.  Still a great song though.

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): i watched this music video high once and the ending gave me a spook

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): Inifnitely better than the original (which was still great, FYI), just because of the 3 fantastic features

**conceptualromance** (9): Rico Nasty is kinda the star of the show here

**liberalitea** (9): this is so weird i love it.

**LostintheCosmicFire** (9): but personally Rico and KKB really shines more than Charli on this

**Palutzel** (8.8): my life is 100 gecs

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): every one of these points is for Rico Nasty holy fucking shit

**fairytalehigh** (8): ringtone (remix) (ft. kero kero bonito & rico nasty) (charli's version) (from the tree of clues)

**jsonphile** (8): okay why is this the Charli xcx song I like the most on this playlist? It should be my least favorite it’s the stupidest and most annoying but it kinda works for me??? I don’t get how I gave HIFN a ~5.5 average but this gets an 8

**musical\_pyn** (8): wait, charli, can you sing the chorus again?

**notarobot3675** (8): this song was really cute but the mv was genuinely a little unsettling

**poptartchill** (8): it's a jam what else can I say

**skargardin** (8): rico ate

**throwaway7650** (7.5): quirky ~ rico's part is the best

**afs** (7): This remix is somehow even more of a trip than the original. It's so bizarre I don't know what score to give.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): I like this remix A LOT but I wish there was a full Laura chorus

**J\_Toe** (7): the only 100 gecs song I would willingly listen to, as it's somewhat tones down.

**Roxieloxie** (7): i think my first exposure to this was when i popped into plug during the hyperpop reveal and i was truly lost (for alot of reasons) but i remember this playing and it working its way into my head like the earworm that it is.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This song is honestly the perfect mix of PC and “traditional” pop! And it’s very cute!

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): the genre for this song is Fantanocore

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Charli's parts sound kinda fun actually

# well you all fucking lost because it won didnt it

**targetguest** (8): music video is musty and I need like rebecca black on this or something

**welcometoNY** (8): the original goes so much harder i will die on this hill

**astrologicalangel** (7): ngl, I prefer the original

**Vultuxe** (7): I never clicked with this as much as people did, it's certainly an improvement over the original (I have some strong opinions on 100 gecs...) but only so much can be done to a song flawed from the start.

**welcome2thejam** (7): Oh hey, it's the one 100 gecs song I listen to without irony! This remix is fun.

**KennyEarthman** (6): only enjoyed Rico Nasty's part tbh

**thedoctordances1940** (6): Recently I've come to realise I don't actually unironically like 100 gecs.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): Gonna be generous with this one because I know my distaste for their music is entirely based on personal taste rather than quality, and Charli’s part is nice enough!

**AHSWeeknd** (5): well

**IIIHenryIII** (5): It's not bad.

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): i take it back, hyperpop is not growing on me.

**vayyiqra** (4): Sorry I am known to be a Gecs anti and I like Charli and Sarah but they barely save this. I don't care for Rico's part either way and I absolutely hate the intro. I tried.

**shhhneak** (1): everybody in this song is doing a different assignment.

Don't get me wrong, I adore XS, I mean it got my 11, but this winning would have been such a lovely surprise. I honestly don't have a whole lot to say about it, melodically it's so pretty, honestly as a package it's just so *pretty*, like it **sounds** pretty as a song, that's so impressive. I love all the layers in the song, all the instruments layered on top of one another, and I love how spacey Halle sounds in the bridge, that's a highlight for me. Overall this would've been a lovely winner, but it'll make a great winner of AS5 too so whatever :)

---

# honestly the real g's for 11'ing this

**1998tweety** (11): oh my lorde this song is gorgeous, im floating

**AHSWeeknd** (11): This is one of the greatest songs ever created. Mozart whom!??

**akanewasright** (11): This song deserves to win. It is the best song on the album, a song where both girls get to show off their vocal ability, and just groovy and perfect in general. I love Rina, but XS does not deserve over this.

**bookthieving** (11): the production is stunning here, perfectly setting the moody, mysterious late-night vibe while still letting cxh's gorgeous vocals shine through. and the songwriting is lovely, a fresh take on the ""loving yourself before loving someone else"" theme that matches the poeticism of the title.

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): Please let this beat XS...

**endcreditouilles** (11): not being able to give multiple 11s in this rate is a war crime, CxH just don't fucking miss. When u decide u like urself and appreciate Ungodly Hour for the masterpiece it is, holla at me.

**engifear** (11): That ""Won't you love me?"" as the bridge is ending and that final chorus (and let's be real, the entire song) is just heavenly

**fadedblue09** (11): One of my favorite discoveries last year, and fully convinced me to see the talent of these girls. Very slick and hypnotizing, and a magnificent display of their vocals.

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): This song is just a work of art that I don’t even really know what to say about it; it’s perfect, which is actually something I could talk about a little bit I guess. When this album came out people were *buzzing* about it on popheads and at first I wrote it off because I thought Chloe X Halle were “too perfect” for me but then I stopped and thought about it and I was like wait… is that racist? Because that’s the same shit that people say about Beyoncé. It’s like, we demand that these women be “relatable” and feel “accessible” to us but then pounce on them for doing anything “messy,” but then when they push past all of this and focus solely on their craft they get labelled as stuck up or as robots. And I almost missed out on one of the best albums of the decade (it’s totally not too early for me to say that) because of my prejudices. Idk maybe it’s just me but think about how you interact with black artists is what I’m trying to say I guess. Anyways, this song is a stunning blend of pop/r&b/dance with a bridge that could span the Atlantic, long live Chloe X Halle and may your every hour be ungodly.

**Itsafudgingstick** (11): So this is my ultimate fave song of 2020 actually. There are a select few songs that just latch on to me instantly but the dreamy, atmospheric vibes of the title track pulled me in right away. It’s just such a lush, gorgeous track and I don’t think I will ever tire of it.

**jackisboredtoday** (11): this production is so perfect and I don’t even really have that much to say about this song but its just so good

**jayjaysortagay** (11): nothing in this already amazing rate can match the ethereal quality of this song

**mudkip1** (11): literally the best song ever made point blank period

**oscarbrierley1** (11): the vocals, the production, its amazing

**racloves** (11): this song is just a masterpiece

**rosecoloreds** (11): if covid wasn't a thing i'd be throwing it back to this song in a gay club but im forced to do this in my room

**sssaaage** (11): r&b and house are like my two fav genres so ofc i love this.. we need more like this (stream play with the changes by rochelle jordan btw)

**SupremeShani** (11): Absolute perfection, the combination of Chloe and Halle's soft, concise harmonies and Disclosure's signature production just creates a song that is so impossibly ethereal, spacey, electric, and groovy all at the same time. I could really gush about this song for hours, the production's synths here are so minimal but precise here, and just lets the girls angelic vocals swirl all around in what is hopefully the winner of this rate.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): this song is pure brilliance. the harmonies, THE BRIDGE, the topic, the production. it feels like i'm listening to liquid gold

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (11): this song really has it all- excellent harmonies, a good beat, a catchy hook, interesting song structure, pointed lyrics... i could go on

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): To me, this song is absolute Pop Perfection. Every sound is right, every melody is sung in the right way, and the icing on the cake is Halle’s harmonious yet haunting “Love Me”s floating through the bridge, each one like a lost soul forever searching for romance

**wavingwolves** (11): in a perfect world this would be the #1 song </3

# if i decided i liked myself i would holler at all these people

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): This rate has like 3 songs that I wanted to give an 11 to; this is one of them. Disclosure in extraordinary form in making a sensual, glimmering instrumental that CxH freaking nail, not hard to see why this song's name carried to the album.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): the chorus in this.. and the bridge.. and the verses.. and the outro.. Wowza.

**afs** (10): Ooooh this is slick. Love the nostalgic production on this one, and their vocals are especially heavenly here.

**Alumineous** (10): This is heavily reminiscent of Dire Dire Docks from Super Mario 64.

**bespectacIed** (10): [I did the writeup on this song for popheads top 100 songs of 2020] (https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kyrcji/the_top_100_tracks_of_2020_according_to_rpopheads/gjjlcdi?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) and it was honestly the only time i used brainpower during the entire 2020

**bigbigbee** (10): This song is really something special. A sit-up-in-your-chair song. A scramble-to-open-Shazam song. A download-on-first-listen song.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): One of two runners up for my eleven. This is easily the best dance pop song in this rate.

**camerinian** (10): mostly I'm just mad that Disclosure's RnB collabs don't all sound like this. Where was this sort of gold on Caracal huh???

**CarlieScion** (10): a winner mayhaps [2]

**celladonn** (10): The production, the vocals, the vibes... immaculate

**cremeebrulee** (10): if this is somehow 1 point off from beating XS please @ me for not 11ing this but otherwise i hope this gets to be runners up!!! this song literally blows me away every time i listen to it. its gorgeous in every way and it makes me so excited to see where cxh go next.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): honestly, if you give this your 11, no matter where it ends up you get the moral victory. Good on you.

**Dekubaku** (10): So tempted to give this an 11. A masterpiece!

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I love Chloe’s lines in this. I love how the song is about someone needing to work on themselves (“when you decide you like yourself” is brutal lol) before they can be in relationship but isn’t even a ejection given that’s it explicitly saying come back after.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I don't know what CxH and Disclosure put in this song but my goodness this is fucking perfect. They should collab again.

**EnCaine** (10): i am fully single but the lyrics still hit so hard, favorite song of 2020 contender. This would 100% get my 11 if it weren't for XS

**fairytalehigh** (10): definitely spent most of 2020 thinking the chorus was ""when you don't have time to think about it / love me but just don't call me at work."" this of course makes no sense. anyway this song is perfect

**fenellabeach** (10): i mean what more can i say

**frogaranaman** (10): that chorus gets stuck in my head so often

**hakkerj** (10): CLUB JAMMMMM

**hikkaru** (10): they snapped and disclosure snapped on the production

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): this is just so ethreal, the production’s smoothness contrasted with the brisk claps and Chloe/halles flawless vocals. The girls could not do it better

**ignitethephoenix** (10): such a perfect song. Disclosure did amazing in here and I would love to see the girls continue to work with producers like them

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Checkmate, atheists.

**iniekcja\_** (10): Disclosure always serve but somehow their set was possibly the worst concert I've ever been to

**izeaklapaucius** (10): i heart disclosure

**jasannn** (10): Daddy Disclosure did amazing work here.

**jaztinax** (10): the chorus just hits different

**juanolsen** (10): my personal favorite from the album, i love how sexy and sultry it is while also giving an air of mystery and sweetness

**Leixander** (10): so effortlessly cool, love it

**liberalitea** (10): i just love this song

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): invented singing and harmonies, also the VMA UH is the superior version and i can't believe they were capable of THAT",Awkward_King,,8,8,2021-05-30 21:47:16

I think if XS weren't in this rate this may be my 11, it's definitely one of my favourite songs of last year, which was an incredible year for music. The raw fucking energy this radiates is absolutely peak Charli and I think goes above and beyond for her even. The drop in the chorus is laced with the same crack that Charli inserted into ringtone, and the blaring synths throughout are insane and shouldn't work as well as they do. It is also a weirdly beautiful time capsule of like Springtime last year, when everything was shitty but seemed oddly hopeful still. It's odd to be nostalgic of a time that clearly none of us enjoyed, but it feels like there is safety in familiarity, and at this point we are finally coming out of lockdown and I don't know if I am emotionally and socially ready for that, and so the comfort a song like Anthems brings is appreciated

**hakkerj** (11): Song of the millennium

**iniekcja\_** (11): this could go to any of the last three tracks but I feel like popheads might hate this one because of the Dylan Brady production

**izeaklapaucius** (11): imagine if I had the talentry of her and A. G. Cook in my basement 1 year ago. I could've definitely write this song.

**nick1372** (11): No song captures 2020 like this. The glitchy production and slightly off-kilter lyrics expressed exactly how I felt throughout the year in a way that nothing else could. All I can say is thank god for this song.

**Palutzel** (11): BANGER imagine if this kind of music topped the charts

**therokinrolla** (11): an incredible soundscape that perfectly encapsulates the rapturous energy buildup brought to us by quarantine. The production is like a bouncyball stuck in a motor engine and the lyrics are so stupid and terrible it's brilliant. a modern day work of art honestly

**vagenda** (11): This song is like a sandblaster for my brain when I’m getting bogged down in COVID-related anxiety. It has this amazing tension between denial and catharsis, frustration and euphoria. It’s a lament for the nights we’re missing out on that will act as a perfect soundtrack for the moment we get them back; an anthem in waiting. It’s also the dictionary definition of a fucking banger and that sure doesn’t hurt

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (11): ; just absolute perfection. I desperately want to see this performed live.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Even if the lyrics are kind of weird the total chaos of this song and just how hard it goes, continuing with Pink Diamond, really makes this track a standout.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): an album highlight

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): HEAD BANGIN' IN BED RN.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): y'all when we get a Charli concert... and she plays this... I don't even want to think about it

**camerinian** (10): IM SO BORED WHOOP best two seconds of this rate

**CarlieScion** (10): goes awf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**celladonn** (10): TRULY the 2020 anthem

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Forever is the sad song for remembering fun times with your friends, Anthems is the happy song for remembering fun times with your friends.

**frogaranaman** (10): this literally hits so much harder as the pandemic continued on.. probably the most impactful song on the album, who knew such an early quarantine mood would literally only grow harder as it continued on

**hikkaru** (10): I'M SO BORED me after listening to party 4 u, good thing this banger is right after

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): Charli lonely ?? but Charli ride ??

**joeeswift** (10): reminds me of early quarantine and im weirdly nostalgic

**KennyEarthman** (10): this song just summed up my pandemic experience

**liberalitea** (10): sEX ME AND MY ROMEO YESSS

**LuisEnRod** (10): this is (to me) the “trying not to go crazy” lockdown anthem

**martian\_pet** (10): the amount of times i've deafened myself playing this at max volume...

**musical\_pyn** (10): other than track 10, this is to me the charli xcx song

**nootnoot781** (10): when this gets played in the clubs >>>

**pat-rickstar** (10): Still think she's saying ""island anthems"" but it slaps so

**pig-serpent** (10): crazy overactive snyth line and Charli has the audacity to yell ""I'm So Bored"" this is why I love her.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this is what i mean by chaos. that explosion of sound is just a breath of fresh air after the comparatively laid back tracks. the chorus is just so big!

**racloves** (10): man this hits hard

**runaway3212** (10): I too am bored

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): An10ems amirite

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Go off!

**sirpancakeXI** (10): massive bop

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is my favorite song on this album and encompasses my overarching mood for the last year. I truly do just wanna go to parties, wanna feel the heat from all the bodies.

**targetguest** (10): when I listen to this song I feel nostalgic for the late NY parties I never attended when I was in school

**waluigiest** (10): LYRICIST OF THE CENTURY

**wavingwolves** (10): when i sent this to my best friend last year saying ''i miss us''... a moment i'm fond of

**welcome2thejam** (10): Crazy good chorus carries this song to its super high score.

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): My other favorite car crash song

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I cannot stop listening to this song. I know this song is about longing (for something you don’t have), but actually, she’s so good at describing the things that she wants that it makes me feel powerful, and excited; like I’m in the middle of .

**fadedblue09** (9.5): I'm not fond of the abrasive production, but damn these lyrics really hit hard considering last year.

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**akanewasright** (9): me when i’m so bored. woo.

**artzpop** (9): Why is this song still relevant. This pandemi should have been over a year ago already. That being said agreed with everything

**bbfan132** (9): the fan-submitted lyrics… they went from shit to excellent in a matter of two lines

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Any song Charli makes with Danny L Harle is always gold. A PSA for y'all to get vaccinated when you can so we can get fucked up in the clubs again.

**EnCaine** (9): s/o to that part of the instrumental that plays at ~1:50 minutes it's so good

**juanolsen** (9): Charli really puts into perspective how quarantine has affected her as someone who loves ves to party and it's extremely extroverted

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): Really the best intro for the whole year...........I'M SO BORED

**ktajlili** (9): Iconic.

**rickikardashian** (9): okay now i understand the gays that say they wanna listen to this album at a club

**Roxieloxie** (9): okay so this is what throtzilla would sound like if it wasnt horny

**slimboyfriend** (9): I'm so bored WOO

**thedoctordances1940** (9): absolute banger and placed perfectly in the tracklisting

**Uberpigeon** (8.7): I think this is the best song on the album, not by much

**Qustomar** (8.5): The first half is ok for me, but I love the second half when the production really gets its chance to shine.

**seanderlust** (8.5): you know, this song grew on me from first listen. the chorus' end I think bothered me bc it feels so anticlimactic (""we might be even closer"") but other than that nitpicky thing I really like this

**SupremeShani** (8.5): Just like Pink Diamond, I think I usually only click with Charli when she embraces these harsher and more aggressive soundscapes.

**geraldinewww** (8.2): gotta have my bowl gotta have cereal

**IIIHenryIII** (8): an anthem for an anthem.

**J\_Toe** (8): this song addresses the COVID-19 quarantine the most directly. I think other songs were written a lot earlier, but the themes of isolation, mental health, and being alone with just one person fit the album well enough to be added. But eating cereal as a lyric only makes sense for the quarantine album.

**Oberionsynth** (8): FINALL an anthem anthem, we've hit the meta guys pack it up time to go

This is honestly boosted for me just by how funny I find it that Halle absolutely fucking hates it LMAO. I get why this is a bonus song, I don't think it exactly holds up especially to be more necessary than any of the original tracks, but it is still a very good song and pleasant to listen to.

---

# chloe

**Brendon-Urine** (10): even the bonus songs are amazing whew

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): flawless, stunning, the moment

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wait this is good, why didn’t i save this after i first heard it

**iniekcja\_** (10): I really hoped to get a break from maths after my exams...

**KennyEarthman** (10): that chorus is so sexy

**musical\_pyn** (10): another incredible chloe x halle track

**oscarbrierley1** (10): makes me want to cheat on my non existent boyfriend

**plastichaxan** (10): imagine making these whole ass bangers as bonus tracks

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): why they relegated this + ""hazy"" to bonus tracks is beyond me, they're two of their best from the era. this is my less favorite of the two though

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): could have been on the standard album I fear

**SupremeShani** (9.5): i will never got over the way halle absolutely despises this song every time it would get brought up on the live lmao

**LostintheCosmicFire** (9.3): should have been in the main rate x 2

**akanewasright** (9): “I’m a good girl, but you made me bad” with all that vocal fry... Halle you own my life now.

**notarobot3675** (9): this is such a bop! really wish we could get an mv for this

**Oberionsynth** (9): ""thinking bout that 20/20"" me everytime i try to read a reddit post without my glasses

**urfavgalpal** (8.8): I also have not listened to this enough to know how I feel but I think I’m really into it?

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): I wanted to give this an 8.2 for the joke but this song is just too good for that

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): I like the darker direction on this one more than on Hazy for sure

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8.5): Makes me feel like a bad b

**engifear** (8): Well I guess the guy ended up making it harder on her

**liberalitea** (8): I prefer Hazy but this is still a great track

**pig-serpent** (8): The instrumentation is really just alright, but this is easily a stronger hook than anything they laid down for the album and that bumps it up a point or two.

**poptartchill** (8): This could've been on the original album

**waluigiest** (8): about average for the album (so really good)

**wavingwolves** (7.7): this sounds like a bonus song but it's still pretty good

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The better bonus track, but I don't care for it that much I fear

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I like the guitar. It sounds like something I've heard before.

**bbfan132** (6.5): an understandable bonus track, pretty catchy though

# halle

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.5): halle seems so bored

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Halle was partly right, this ain’t all that, but it is great.

**amiriteor** (8): just sounds like a chloe x halle song

**throwaway7650** (7.5): hazy should've been pushed instead of this

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): kinda feels like are you that somebody?

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): a bit dated, and not in a good way.

**targetguest** (7): and didn't get the hype for this one

**frogaranaman** (6): this is definitely a bonus track

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): ensuring the album has no skips by putting the worst song last ugh their MINDS, queen shit

**runaway3212** (6): meh

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): According to the youtube comments (lol) this song is about cheating, and uh… let’s just say when it comes to CxH infidelity songs I prefer “Wonder What She Thinks of Me”

**jman457** (5.8): Glad this was on the deluxe version

**astrologicalangel** (5): I did not want to think about 2020 again thanks

**Vultuxe** (5): Same as the other one... it's a reject. Nothing special.

This is one of my favourite tracks on the album, and I'm so glad it made it this high up, it ended up being a real dark horse in the rate tbh. This feels the most reminiscent of their prior album, The Kids Are Alright, but I'm not quite sure why? I think it's the way they're singing, it feels very airy which is how I think of tracks like Down and Fall on TKAA! But yes, so glad it lasted this long, even if it just missed the top 10 :sob:

---

# dont make it harder on me HE HEEEEEE

**musical\_pyn** (11): the impeccable harmonies, the strings coming in on the chorus and then when the chorus opens up, and an incredible hook all make this song easily my 11. I absolutely cannot wait for more chloe x halle

**tectec787** (11): their voices are so beautiful, the melodies and harmonies are mwah! I love this song

**TiltControls** (11): best song on the album

**1998tweety** (10): they just cant stop winning wtf

**akanewasright** (10): Seeing them do this song live (at the tiny desk concert of course, I’m not going to concerts) completely changed my opinion on this song. It’s fucking wonderful.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): the best song on the album

**bespectacIed** (10): Always has been, always will be the best song on the album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This was the other runner-up for my eleven. The vocals, the production, that IMMACULATE PRECHORUS, the lyrics which are firm but also vulnerable. I feel like this is gonna get robbed in the rate and I'm pre-bitter.

**endcreditouilles** (10): this has such a classic sound, the vocals and production are immaculate. And the strings!!! My heart is on the floor in a puddle

**fadedblue09** (10): The vocals here just give me chills.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song was a sleeper hit for me, I didn’t think much of it when I first listened to the album (it didn’t help that it’s sandwiched between two bangers) but over time I’ve really come to appreciate the cinematic storytelling of the track… like something about the juxtaposition between apparent frustration and mounting joy just tickles me pink. Plus the strings are to die for and I actually think this is one of the best choruses on the album! Underrated imo

**ignitethephoenix** (10): their harmonies i ascend

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh WOW

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): So I always liked this song since the release of the album but very recently (inspired by their tiny desk performance which is def a MUST WATCH) I have started to stan it. It’s just such a beautifully created song, with such an angsty subject matter yet an upbeat instrumental (my fave genre of music). And the adlibs in the outro of the song are just chefs kiss. The girlies did their thing here

**jaztinax** (10): the motown vibe in this is immaculate

**KennyEarthman** (10): a dreamy bop my dad would play in the car

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (10): The harmonies in this one....and then when the strings pick up towards the end....they sound.............godly

**ManofOranges** (10): Now THIS is an immediate standout for me. This song absolutely hooked me right away. Definitely my favorite discovery of this entire rate. Just so amazing.

**nooodisaster** (10): Ugh I adore this song. The old-school style is a great change of pace too.

**ReallyCreative** (10): such a fun fucking track, yet another masterpiece

**shhhneak** (10): Almost my 11. COME THROUGH HARMONIES. And the strings.

**skargardin** (10): VOCALS

**steelstepladder** (10): SO close to getting my 11

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): stunning

**throwaway7650** (10): this song is so cheesy in a good way

**wasian-invasion** (10): the voCALZ

**zagreux** (10): this song is so relatable omfg they were NOT playing around

**Alumineous** (9.9): I try not to use decimals. However, I deducted 0.1 because I don't like it when Chloe belts ""meeeEEEeeeEEEEEeeeahhhh"" at the end.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): the vocals i just, wow

**savemeaseat143** (9.6): the chorus!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): That's a straight up banger. That pre-chorus is divine. It's actually better than the chorus, which made me shy away from giving it a 10. That pre-chorus is even better than the one on Tipsy.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): god what a good chorus. not that the verses are a drag or anything but that chorus flies

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): I love this sound for them

**wavingwolves** (9.1): wait... ?? let me listening again ??????????

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Such Beyoncé IASF vibes

**bbfan132** (9): such a good album cut ugh

**CrimsonROSET** (9): me listening to this album trying to not give everything 10s

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): I love the prechorus especially. You can really feel the pining for an ex better left alone.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Man, this song makes me regret breaking up with my non-existent ex-boyfriend.

**engifear** (9): I'm a sucker for a song with strings

**runaway3212** (9): bop!

**juanolsen** (8.8): really catchy melodies hut the lyrics are a bit clunky

**hakkerj** (8.6): The last 30 seconds of this song goes offfff

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I love how classic this song sounds; it’s a bit of a throwback for me. I think it really compliments the rest of the songs on this record well. It feels like an ending, to me; I think this might have made a great closer on some other iteration of the album.

**EnCaine** (8.5): really dope ending

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): this is so comforting and old timey plus VOCALS ??

**jman457** (8.5): The production and Vocals are on point, they should take advantage of their harmonies more often

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): The production is gorgeous

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): VOCALS!!! This one will not leave my head omfg

**urfavgalpal** (8.5): again not much to say beyond they have gorgeous voices.  Also they have really good story telling ability.

**fairytalehigh** (8.4): this grew on me a lot once i realized what it was about, but not a standout for me

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): A great, well-written ballad that definitely shines in the second half of the record. Love the energy to this one.

**afs** (8): It was only a matter of time until soul makes an appearance, and even though I'm not too into old school stuff, that chorus forces a high score.

**frogaranaman** (8): queens of making relatable love songs when you want to hoe out but then it becomes hoe out with one person

**Oberionsynth** (8): the vocals on this ugh i'm pregnant

**salivantsonority** (8): Mildly cliché and tonally different from the rest of the record. The All Night of this record. But that chorus is really delicious-sounding.

**slimboyfriend** (8): This would have been such a good album closer if the album didn't have two more average songs after this one.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): the tiny desk concert was what got me into this song

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): the honda stage version would've gotten a 10

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I never realized how good this song sounds!!

**Vromega** (8): gorgeous instrumentation, especially the violins

**welcome2thejam** (8): Grooving with this one.

**liberalitea** (7): I love this song but can't give it a higher score than this because the message just...idk

**racloves** (7): I’ll tell you what’s hard on me, this rate as I love all of these albums wtf

**Uberpigeon** (7): romcom vibes

# it should be illegal to say anything negative about this song

**pig-serpent** (6): I love some of the twang on the bass here, but overall the song isn't that interesting.

**Vultuxe** (1): What the hell happened to this album? This song is nigh unlistenable. The vocal delivery is tragic.

# everyone thinks they're twins but they're actually just sisters jdsjaks

**SupremeShani** (9): Such a lovely song, I think the sparser production with the strings and plucked guitar works well here with the twin's voices.",Awkward_King,,6,6,2021-05-30 19:57:28

Bad Friend is one of those songs that feels equally like a personal anecdote and like an experience which anybody can relate to, and I think that's a testament to Rina's lyricism. The touching re-telling of how Rina lost contact with someone who was once her closest friends, not through any dramatic event, but simply the passing of life, is something I don't know I've ever heard be sung about before? Platonic friendships aren't the topic of many songs, especially in this way, so this is nice. While, as you can probably tell from my score, it isn't my favourite, I still definitely understand why other people love it and can appreciate it for that.

# summer of 2020, singing our hearts out to rina

**astrologicalangel** (11): fuck

**bespectacIed** (11): I love this song. Heck, I *lived\* this song. Well not literally; I never ran through the Tokyo streets at night and got drank and sang Carly at a karaoke with my friends. But I felt in my bones what Rina wanted to evoke in this song: perfectly capturing the tiniest details of pure bliss after they're long gone. The pandemic made me reminisce on all the relationships I lost from self-isolation, depression, growing up and moving on, etc... Bad Friend soundtracked the most self-introspective year of my life (all our lives). I've accepted this won't win but 11 is not enough for this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Media hardly ever makes me cry, especially music. I've listened stone-faced to songs about far more serious/depressing topics than this, but Bad Friend is just so viscerally relatable. There are so many songs about romanic breakups - they crowd up the Hot 100, but the ending of friendships whether slowly/passively or suddenly is something we've all experienced more frequently but is rarely represented in music. And like relationships, friendships usually end for a reason. Bad Friend pierces me so much because it puts to words all my fears that I'm not connecting/reconnecting with people because of my own insecurities, anxieties, and self-induced isolation. That I'm the reason.

**pat-rickstar** (11): These comments are going to be full of people saying how much they relate to this, but it's true! It's refreshing to hear a song about a friendship breakup for once rather than a romantic one, and when it's as good as this, I have to give it my 11

**sirpancakeXI** (11): having a fall out with my best friends are always my biggest fear, now that we have finally graduated and will be going our separate way in university, i was worried that i will actually become the bad friend and said something that might hurt their feeling and slowly drift away because i have unfortunately done it before. i feel like this beautiful song really represented this kind of fear in me and i hope that i can gradually change myself and be a better friend to others.

**welcome2thejam** (11): Read somewhere that the chorus was meant to evoke a roller coaster. And yeah, that first chorus absolutely feels like when you're cresting the top of a hill, feeling weightless, floating out of your seat, and time just slows. It leaves me a bit breathless every time I hear it. And as someone who's lost track of friendgroups by being a Bad Friend, holy shit does this hit. A song that's climbing up fast on my Top Songs that Will Fuck Me Up Every Time I Listen to It list.

**1998tweety** (10): smasha

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): A shining crown jewel in the tracklisting, like holy shit the LYRICS are so direct, it just hits where it hurts the most. How often have you just have had friendships in the past where you felt like the world were you two's oyster, and then with no true catalyst, everything just dissipates in a whimper, and you just find yourself thinking: was it your fault? How are they doing now, would they still even fucking remember your name? Rina puts all these emotions out on the table for you, over an instrumental that is doused in a gasoline of nostalgia, heavy with melodrama.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I don’t get why people don’t like this. It’s so gut wrenchingly beautiful.

**Alumineous** (10): In 2018, I became friends with this awesome lesbian woman from my university LGBTQ+ club. One night, we went bar hopping together, which ended with drunk karaoke. Eventually, we just... stopped talking. I was an undergrad, she was a masters student, it was bound to happen. Last summer, I made one visit to her Facebook profile just to see how she was doing. She has a girlfriend now. Got her masters. Has a fantastic engineering job. She sent me a message on FB 32 weeks ago. It said, ""Hey! I hope you're doing all right!"" And I kept it unread. Yup. I'm the bad friend.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): i'm a sucker for a choir moment

**bookthieving** (10): when this song outlasts carly's entire album

**camerinian** (10): Hands waaaaaaay the fuck up. Apologies to all of the group chats and Discord channels that I disappear from for weeks at a time.

**cashewconstellation** (10): i ALMOST gave this song my eleven, i've had so many nervous breakdowns to it, it's amazing

**conceptualromance** (10): yeah ??

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Oh God, this is like my huge fear as someone who is a huge extrovert who wants to be friends with literally everybody. There are a couple of close friends that I don't want to lose my connection with and this song literally tackles my fear of losing a close friend because we are on different pathways in our lives. I still want my close friends to somehow be part of my life despite the changing nature. The thought of not being able to talk to them just really scares me all the time. Thank you so much Rina for this song.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I hate myself.

**engifear** (10): I've lost many friendships because I stopped putting in the effort, usually due to depression and anxiety. It hurts to fall out with someone and know it's your fault. I don't think I had a close friend last more than 2 years, except for my partner.

**fadedblue09** (10): Among the Rina frontrunners, this is my favorite. It captures a very emotionally complex subject matter and showcases one of Rina's more intimate performances.

**fairytalehigh** (10): the circumstances of 2020 gave me a lot of time to contemplate all the friends i've lost touch with, and all the friends i miss. this song evokes all that in such a touching, empathetic way.

**ggal2020** (10): sometimes I feel like I’ve been this bad friend more than I’ve been a good friend, and there’s not enough songs about the pain of losing a friend (especially when it’s your fault) which for me is harder than losing a lover. break ups happen all the time, but friends are supposed to be forever.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Hopefully by the time this rate is revealed I’ll have texted back my best friend from high school that I’ve been ghosting for five years despite her consistently reaching back out to me! Wish me luck!

**hunnybee12** (10): such a special song, we really need more songs about friendships over romantic relationships

**jman457** (10): The lyrics hit a little too close to home, but it's still amazing

**juanolsen** (10): one of the best songs of the year, i am a firm believer that loosing a friend hurts more than loosing a lover and this song hits really close home

**liberalitea** (10): well this mentions Carly so it's already above average, but the song honestly is just THAT good, and so relatable for me. especially during quarantine when i've felt really isolated and that i'm losing friends which has brought me down a lot. it's really nice escapism and i wish topics like this were discussed more in pop.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this song could have easily been my 11, I absolutely love everything about it

**nooodisaster** (10): PUT YOUR HANDS UP IF YOU'RE NO GOOD AT THIS STUFF

**notarobot3675** (10): this song just gets me so emotional

**plastichaxan** (10): me singing/screaming/crying this everytime i hear it it's true

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): oh no ok so this song also makes me cry every time i hear it because it's directly calling out all of my bad behaviors. but it is also a reminder that i can't be too hard on myself and that i have to have some level of grace for the people that i love, including myself! i also love the layered vocals with the music cut out. so pretty!

**pros-and-connors** (10): this song is a punch to the proverbial gut every time. Also the video is ART!

**ReallyCreative** (10): I'm in this picture and I don't like it.",Awkward_King,,7,7,2021-05-30 20:42:19

I don't know quite how to put it because I'm not particularly musically minded, but this feels much sonically darker than anything on the original edition of UH, like it sounds like it would have like purple cloud effects around it if it were in a video game to suggest it had been poisoned? Does that make sense? Anyway, while this isn't really my favourite, I'm not too keen on that darker sounding vibe here, nor is the drum and bass outro really for me, I'm happy this made it as far as it did, even if it was always a kind of distant second place!

# daisybop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is an insane experience. They were holding onto this excellence for too long. Chloe’s production is beyond.

**akanewasright** (10): MASSIVE bop

**engifear** (10): The DnB moment is just chefs kiss

**fairytalehigh** (10): that monster chorus, the harmonies, that DnB breakdown at the end, oh my ??

**KennyEarthman** (10): has a horror movie ambience

**liberalitea** (10): one of their best songs me thinks

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): this sounds like Ungodly Hour's evil sexy twin, soo excited for CxH3.Also, it should have been in the main rate

**runaway3212** (10): immaculate

**SideBTrack8** (10): I wish this was in the main rate, it would have been such an easy 11

**SupremeShani** (10): this is strangely specific but half of their songs feels like they're about to murder me but like in a slow and sexy way

**throwaway7650** (10): would be top 3 on the album if this was included in the main rate

**TiltControls** (10): spooky, but like, in a good way

**waluigiest** (10): an 11 contender if it were in the main rate. It’s got this blend of warm and dark sounds that works really well, and the lyrics are gorgeous like the rest of the album. The frantic, sexy bridge just elevates it that much more

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I love this. It’s so ominous and strong. I wish it were on the main CD, it would be in my top 4 songs there.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): This should be on the album. What were they thinking? It's such a banger.

**Leixander** (9.5): should've been on the main rate! :(

**poptartchill** (9.5): SO GOOD!!! I get why it's a bonus track but it's one of my favorites! The outro is amazing

**wavingwolves** (9.4): ugh this is everything and that outro is everything and a bit more

**wasian-invasion** (9): ooh what a sensual song

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): I see why this was a bonus track but it's still great

**EnCaine** (8.7): something about the lyric ""smell my daisies"" bothers me too much to rate this as high as i wanted to lmao really good song tho

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Omg why did CxH scrap this song from the original tracklist? This is so good omg.

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): The drum n bass moment, this is their Sine From Above

**Palutzel** (8.3): those deluxe songs might be better than most of the non deluxe

**jasannn** (8.2): My witch anthem

**afs** (8): Kinda slow and has some sort of a... Halloween vibe? Also didn't expect it to switch around like that at the end. In a good way.

**Alumineous** (8): Chloe using her lower part of her mezzo-soprano is just so seductive.

**iniekcja\_** (8): this is mixed weirdly but the dnb outro was cute

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This feels like something somewhere between circus music and something I would be murdered to

**urfavgalpal** (8): I honestly haven’t listened to this song enough times to figure out how I feel about it.  It’s so weird and kinda scary but hey music is supposed to make you feel something

**Roxieloxie** (7.4): I mean its deluxe track for a reason

**bbfan132** (7): the production sounded nice here, nice outro

**pig-serpent** (7): I like what this song is trying to do, but I think it should've leaned into the wonkiness a bit more than it does.

**seanderlust** (7): i like the line ""I know it's in you like knives,"" but tbh I am glad this wasn't on the standard edition

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): Definitely a bonus track for a reason but it’s not bad by any means

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): what in the halloween… actually I like this. Especially the girls’ creepy low singing!

**shhhneak** (6.5): the tempo of this song is giving Luigi’s Mansion.

# it kinda sends that im on the lowest scores i feel like no particular way about this song

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Of the 2 bonus tracks, I know people like this but it's just there for me

**jman457** (6.2): kind of boring

**targetguest** (6): didn't get the feel for this one

**Vultuxe** (6): It's okay, definitely feels like a reject of Ungodly Hour.

**astrologicalangel** (5): lowkey sounds like haunted carousel music

If I say this song feels like a clementine is that ? does that make sense? It feels compact and sweet and bright!! This is Dylan Brady at is best imo, just making fucking happy, fun hyperpop songs, and he really shines here I think, despite him not even being on the song.

---

# dylan brady sympathisers

**jman457** (11): This song made me get through the early part of the pandemic, and gave me the energy to finish my work and graduate

**1998tweety** (10): i hate to say it but this is amazing wtf. like I know yall clown Charli for her repetitive songs but this works really well. Also it has just enough weird to stan out but not enough to be abrasive.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): If you hate this song I assume you just hate fun

**amiriteor** (10): UGGGGHHHHHH i wanna be in love

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): such a fun song to feel like a baddie

**celladonn** (10): In this house we love Dylan Brady production

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Dammit Charli we get it you have a cute-ass boyfriend and he is a good kisser. ?? Ugh totally not a bitter single gay here smh. ??

**EnCaine** (10): tbh kinda sick of it (2nd most played of 2020 on my spotify oops) but i'm not letting that change my score

**frogaranaman** (10): when we fucking clowned on her for posting the lyrics on Twitter then it became literally one of her best songs

**hakkerj** (10): Charli really likes rollercoasters

**hunnybee12** (10): the hype after she wrote the lyrics on ig live was such a fun moment

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I like everything about this song, except the outro. It still deserves a 10, though. It's up there on my top 4 favorite Charli songs.

**jayjaysortagay** (10): hit main pop girl yaas queen slay purr house the boots gawd

**Leixander** (10): EVERYTHING BOUT YOU!

**liberalitea** (10): i love this

**martian\_pet** (10): I will get married to this song

**mudkip1** (10): aggressive twerking

**nick1372** (10): pretty good but she should repeat “I like everything about you” more

**nootnoot781** (10): i was a bit skeptical when she teased the lyrics in her livestream, but it works surprisingly well. charli hasn’t missed with dylan so far, and i’m looking forward to see what else is in store from them.

**Palutzel** (10): my friends hate this song and I can't express how brilliant it is (fuck them honestly), dylan brady at his best

**pat-rickstar** (10): yup. Idk I just love this, idc about the stupid lyrics it’s honestly really sweet

**plastichaxan** (10): i don't think the expression ""cherry on top"" has applied to an outro as much as this one for me

**pros-and-connors** (10): on paper this song shouldn’t work, but oh boy does it work

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I really wish this song was called Clementine, it just fits the vibe so much better. Also, is it bad that a part of my brain thinks this version feels kind of empty without Grimes talking about spaghetti over it?

**Roxieloxie** (10): I have been held hostage into liking this song and unfortunately it worked

**skargardin** (10): dylan brady snapped

**wasian-invasion** (10): idgi why is it claws, does his love have its claws in her or something?

**xaviersi** (10): perfect mix of chaos and melody and not to deny the best outro

**zagreux** (10): me writing an essay about my crush in the third grade:

**urfavgalpal** (9.9): okay people like to give Charli shit sometimes because on paper a lot of the times her lyrics seem kinda silly and that is true but I think really what it is is that Charli has a great ear for what will sound great and she has the right presence to deliver anything she writes exactly how it needs to in order to work and I think this is a really great example of this.  The lyrics are cute but kinda basic and I remember them getting some shit when they were posted before the song came out but it really works like you get such a good vibe from it and Charli really sells the whole thing with her attitude.  The production is great and keeps going along at a great little pace.  Also she name drops my favorite fruit.  All in all it’s such an infectious song.

**UselessTacooo** (9.9): my favourite from this album

**Dekubaku** (9.5): Catchy and fun. I like everything about it.

**wavingwolves** (9.4): bop

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Have I been sleeping on Charli XCX. This is insane production.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I expect a jeremih song to play in beatsense right after this or else I will be disappointed

**jasannn** (9): I still don't know why this song is named Claws.

**jaztinax** (9): this is the only song from this album i’ve listened to more than twice

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): this song fucks. every time i just spend the entire song doing random travis scott adlibs while it plays. IT'S LIT!

**Qustomar** (9): I like Claws a lot, I just can't help but feel it sounds like a sped up and less realized version of Forever lol.

**Vultuxe** (9): Contrary to whatever the hell the first two tracks were, claws is SO good I return to it often. It's actually catchy, the production does not hurt my fucking ears (the outro is testing me though). The lyrics are ... tolerable.

**waluigiest** (9): this song is so dumb I’m gonna stream it 200 times

**juanolsen** (8.7): absolute banger

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): Dylan kinda ate

**just\_thonking** (8.5): I feel like I shouldn't like this song on paper, but in practice I very much do

**cashewconstellation** (8): BOP

**CrimsonROSET** (8): but Troye was so right that this should’ve been called clementine tho

**fadedblue09** (8): Another euphoric chorus surrounded by excruciating noise

**musical\_pyn** (8): stream juice just like clementines

**runaway3212** (8): a bit repitative but still great

**Itsafudgingstick** (7.5): Continuing on the grimy hyperpop vibe, here we are. Not much to see here really other than it’s a really cute and easily digestible song, but I do love the random shoutout to Jeremih (mainly cause I legit forgot he existed tbh)

# my mother was run over by the very concept of hyperpop 

**salivantsonority** (8): Didn't age super super well but still a decent bop.

**vayyiqra** (8): I can tell this is Dylan Brady by the clanking snare so this is like 100 Gecs but with the distortion toned down enough that it's enjoyable.

**endcreditouilles** (7.3): juicy just like I DON'T NEED ANYONE, I DON'T NEED ANYONE, I JUST NEED EVERYONE AND THEN SOME

**afs** (7): Nooo it's autotuned rapping again! But hey this time it's music! Also love the part after the final chorus until THAT

**CarlieScion** (7): cute

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): fun song and the auto tune/vocal processing is harsh enough to ruin it for me.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This album is full of songs that make me go “is it actually good? or is it just awful?” Thankfully for this one I decided on the former

**notarobot3675** (6.6): this was a lot of fun! definitely the kind of stuff I enjoy from Charli

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): love the chorus but the verse's are ....

**throwaway7650** (6.5): not a big fan of this song overall and even less a fan of the outro

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6.5): Never really got that into this one but it’s a good song for sure

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (6): Mostly pretty forgettable track on this album, although the very ending is.......not my fave

**ImADudeDuh** (5): https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yY-jctqeJ61I4RMUIAqBsPb6URU=/0x1080/volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/a3168ec5b317f87e458b45c882dde459/repetition_thumb_facebook.jpg

**Raxxin** (5): same as forever LOL

**SupremeShani** (5): every time i hear this, i just think of the phcj post that posted the lyrics and said ""found a song i wrote for my ""girlfriend"" when I was in 6th grade lol"" and just start crying

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UosZ4mXL8EI

**jackisboredtoday** (3.5): this would be at least a full point lower if i weren’t happy to hear her shout out Jeremih, who needs WAY more love around these parts

WHO'S GONNA SAVE YA THIS TIME? You can tell I ain't a musician because I'd never think to make one of my album tracks sound like a live recording for added effect, yet it works *so* well imo. Just as you've had a couple downer, slower paced songs in a row, life is breathed into the album in the form of a crowd chanting and drumming up stadium rock guitars and it feels like a jolt of electricity. And it continues to peak, with each chorus being lowder and more full than the last all heightening up to a glorius final musical climax. This is top tier Rina.

# rina rINA RINA RINA **RINA**

**geraldinewww** (11): all her shows sold out and are 10+ hours from me. i'm never gonna be in the crowd chanting her name. who's gonna save me this time

**KennyEarthman** (11): I never skip this when it comes on shuffle cuz it always brings me so much energy, when that high note arrives I feel myself combusting

**notarobot3675** (11): here is my eleven... truly so well deserved. this song makes me feel so powerful!!!!!

**NotWith10000Men** (11): oh hell yeah back to the shredding. And those high notes?? Ended me. I had like 5 or 6 contenders for my 11, and this was the last one. As soon as I listened to it I thought ""hmmm dark horse candidate?"" and sure enough…

**urfavgalpal** (11): i wasn’t sure what song would get my 11 before I began this rating.  Tbh most of the songs in it could probably get an 11 from me depending on my mood but when I heard the chanting at the beginning the amount of pure joy and excitement I felt made it clear there was no other choice.  This song really has everything that I love about Rina for me.  Lyrics that make me feel, maximalist production, how-the-fuck-is-her-voice-that-good vocals

**1998tweety** (10): i love rock music

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This scares me so much. The power in these lyrics.

**akanewasright** (10): NO ONE! FUCK YOU! ...wait was that question directed at me?

**anothertown** (10): Perfectly counterbalanced against STFU as the two moments of pure escapism and catharsis on the album. STFU’s rage vs this song’s freedom.

**conceptualromance** (10): rock Rina my favorite Rina

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I love melodrama and climatic songs so much.

**frogaranaman** (10): that guitar riff in the bridge FUCKS

**hikkaru** (10): BANGERRRR OMFG if this doesn't make day 3 i'm throwing hands

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): almost my 11. There literally is not a single discernible flaw in this, Rina killed this whole thing

**ignitethephoenix** (10): making this a stadium rock song ... iconic, showstopping, legendary etc.

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): This song is literally a concert MOMENT waiting to happen. Ughhhh I can’t wait until concerts become safe again and I get to experience Rina (and this songgg) live and in person.

**jsonphile** (10): BANGER

**liberalitea** (10): do i even need to explain? the chants in the beginning get me so hyped.

**musical\_pyn** (10): if I ever see rina live this is absolutely the song I am most excited to hear

**pat-rickstar** (10): This being made to feel live really works, it makes it go that bit harder

**plastichaxan** (10): this always makes me wish to be in that rina concert i may never be able to attend

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song FUCKS.

**poptartchill** (10): I enter another dimension when this song comes on

**pros-and-connors** (10): this song has the perfect level of camp with the production to mimic an cheering arena. I’m obsessed

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This stadium rock style works SO well for Rina, and I ADORE the decision to make this sound like a live recording, it fits the song SO well, and amplifies the energy so much.

**seanderlust** (10): that little ""who's gonna save you this time?"" gets me every single time

**shesdoingyoga** (10): We don’t talk about this song enough

**shhhneak** (10): I can’t believe more artists haven’t made fake live productions. It combines the energy of a concert with well mixed vocals.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Whenever I hear this I think of the ""Holding Out For A Hero"" scene in Shrek 2

**Stryxen** (10): me when carly lasts longer in the bonus rate than the main rate

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): god i fucking love this SONG. each and every song here perfectly fits a certain mood and i deeply appreciate the ""i tried to help you, but fuck off and good luck finding this elsewhere lol"" mood here. she also serves vocals. and talent. like always.

**throwaway7650** (10): rina pulls off arena rock so well

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): She’s a rock chick. She likes to rock out

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this is what speak now sounds like according to some swifties

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The stadium rock sound? The vocals?? The keychange??? Immaculate

**wavingwolves** (10): stadium rock rina is something i never thought i needed and now i just need more of it

**welcome2thejam** (10): Still not sure if I like the arena sounds, but it absolutely rips so who gives a shit. Helps that the interjections improve the song tremendously, like that taunting ""who's gonna save you this time?"" near the end. And the ""woo!"" after the bridge is an all-time great ""woo!"" in music.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): ; the best song on the album

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.8): I want to hear this in a packed arena, Rina deserves!! Very fun and powerful, reminds me of Xtina’s Fighter with a bit more of a glam metal vibe to it

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.7): makes me feel like i'm singing at a music festival

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): I love the whole vibe this song has going on of emulating being performed live.

**pheromenos** (9.5): WHO'S GONNA SAVE U NOW?!?!?!?!

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): love the switch up to more live sounding vocals, it's a really cool choice that I wish was utilized a little more often

**SupremeShani** (9.5): Stadium rock and all related genres usually make me feel a certain way, as they tend to get formulaic and borderline tacky for me, but Rina's pop influence and unabashedly powerhouse vocals here absolutely sell the song for me. When the whole pandemic has settled down, I can't wait to hear her perform this one live.

**artzpop** (9.2): pop punk moment I see you babes

**juanolsen** (9.1): idk what this song is about but it is an absolute banger and i absolutely love it, also rina's vocals really shine here

**afs** (9): The Xtina influence is clear as day here,. If this is performed live, the crowd cheering better be as wild as it is here. Oh, and another sudden key change.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I’ve always said this has ‘building up to fight the final boss’ energy, like ‘who’s gonna save me? Myself, bitch’ and kick some ass.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): As a kid who was bullied by a bunch of annoying fuckboi twats, this is the underdog ""revenge"" (for the lack of a better term since Rina doesn't like revenge) bop that I wish my high school self could listen.

**EnCaine** (9): the answer is rina. she's gonna save me now.

**jaztinax** (9): i love the live stadium vibe, brilliant

**nick1372** (9): ugh

**salivantsonority** (9): Thematically so compelling and sonically out of this world. Can't wait to hear this one live.

**thedoctordances1940** (9): Stadium Rock isn't usually me thing, it can often be a bit over the top, but this is so well executed. It's not that this isn't over the top, it absolutely is, but it works so well here and I honestly don't really know why, it's just really fucking good.

**wasian-invasion** (9): this is so extra with the crowd cheering and the key change and I love it

**zagreux** (9): the 'rina! rina! rina!' is so nice to hear aaaah

**cashewconstellation** (8.8): what i wouldn't give to scream along to this in a stadium

**Palutzel** (8.7): rock queen

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Kind of like Love Me 4 Me but feels more committed to the whole rock infusion shtick, and kind of feels a bit more genuine in the self-empowerment thing since it focuses more on herself in a sense? Even if I'm not that big a fan of these songs that try its best to work this kind of heavy-metal in the song, it's still a banger that works in Rina's favour being in this faux-rock-arena crowd that her vocals can eat up hard. A better key-change here than in Paradisin' as well.",Awkward_King,,5,5,2021-05-30 20:13:16

I have such vivid memories of playing this on the bus to my friend coming home from school, when it was the first and only song out from SAWAYAMA. I don't really have a lead off from that it's just an oddly specific memory I have related to the song, and it's funny to think of how fucking hard this must have been going off as we sat their together on the seats right next to the driver because all the others were taken. Rina's ability to combine a bubblegum pop hook with absolutely raging nu-metal, all combined in a song about her first hand experience with micro aggressions... whew give this woman her awards

---

# yasssssss

**jsonphile** (11): such a great banger of a song. And the line “have you ever thought about taping your big mouth shut cause I have many times” is so applicable to so many situations. Obviously microaggressions as the song is about but also: Boss being a jerk at work? Ex being annoying? Accidentally watch Tucker Carlson? Come across a tweet from Ted Cruz? This line always works.

**Stryxen** (11): yas me at popheads when this goes out at 5th maybe 6th

**xxipil0ts** (11): This was such a standout track. Despite the album being a mixture of different pop genres, the blend of elements of Nu Metal, Acoustic, and Radio Pop has made this track really stand out.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): I hate how much I can relate to this song. I’ve had the slit eyes done to me, comments about my rice consumption(???) and other stuff people thought were just harmless jokes. But if you dare call it out, you are made to look like an oversensititive little bitch. Ugh, it can be so aggravating sometimes.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): SHE SHOULD SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE CULTURE-OBSESSED PEOPLE IN THE BACK.

**akanewasright** (10): I love Rina for her music, but I really respect how much she had to stick to her guns to keep this song on the record. Labels shot her down because of this song, but it was 1000% worth keeping. On top of everything, this song just *fucks*

**Alumineous** (10): Once I realized the song was about racial microaggressions towards group minorities, it immediately became a favourite.

**anothertown** (10): dizzying, electrifying!!

**bbfan132** (10): total banger, i can’t resist bobbing/banging my head whenever i listen to this

**bespectacIed** (10): Yup i listen nu-metal artist Rina Sawayama

**bigbigbee** (10): The contrast between hard and strong and sweet and melodic in this song is delicious.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): ""Yes I listen to metal.""

**CarlieScion** (10): so true queen

**celladonn** (10): HahahahahahahahahaHAAAAAAAA

**conceptualromance** (10): god, her mind

**cremeebrulee** (10): she made a song about microaggressions and it goes the fuck off

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is my first proper introduction to Rina. Before then, I only knew her for Cyber Stockholm Syndrome and Comme Des Garçons and that's it. This song gave me this feeling of nostalgia as it reminded me of the dominance of nu-metal in the early 2000s while giving me some kind of action in its anthem against racist microaggressions that POC have to endure. Rina gave us an angry pop nu-metal bop that POC pop fans have been waiting for and she fucking served.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): LIKE THE FIRST TIME, PLEASE

**EnCaine** (10): listening to this live when it debuted was an EXPERIENCE

**geraldinewww** (10): the fact that she opened her album era with THIS... rina your mind

**hunnybee12** (10): HAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAA (in melody)

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Everything about this song is perfect, that's all I'm gonna say. Actually, I just have one more thing to ennounce, if you don't give this a ten, I hate to break it to you, but you are very, very likely to have bad taste.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): end racism QUEEN!

**iniekcja\_** (10): a literal cultural reset

**jasannn** (10): The first time I heard this track I thought it was doing too much and my least favorite track by far. It wasn't until I watched the Fantano review of SAWAYAMA that I gave this song another chance. He pointed out that evil laugh that goes into a high note and that remains one of my favorite parts of the album. I never seen a song talk about microagressions and fetishizing that asians get and she executes it perfectly. This song is so angry yet cathartic, and I love it.

**jman457** (10): Sure the music video is amazing, but doing just a pure metal song was an amazing idea. We have no choice but to stan

**KennyEarthman** (10): she can tell me to STFU anytime

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (10): I'm not usually into rock this ""hard"", but I will absolutely take the opportunity to alterate screaming and whispering ""shut the fuck up""

**Leixander** (10): HAhaHAhaHAhaHAHAHA HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**liberalitea** (10): a nu-metal song about the microagressions she's faced in the industry?! YES. the switch up into the chorus (especially the 2nd one) & her laugh are so iconic too.

**ManofOranges** (10): Me to myself when I say something stupid.

**martian\_pet** (10): Dedicated to everyone responsible for this song not making it to last day of reveal if it doesnt make it

**nick1372** (10): we love metal music

**nootnoot781** (10): i want to see olivia lux lipsync to this song. idk why i just know she’d kill it

**notarobot3675** (10): oof it was a toss up between this and who's gonna save you now for the 11 score but... yeah. this song is without flaw.

**pat-rickstar** (10): I love how the guitars just drop away and it becomes a bubblegum pop song in the chorus, and her delivery is just so perfect

**plastichaxan** (10): no but the way i was shook when this was the first single and then watching the video… no one is doing it like her

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): what an absolute monster of a song. and it's something i have felt so hard. there's nothing like being attracted to someone only for their jungle fever to come out.

**racloves** (10): there’s so many people I want to sing this to

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I really hope this doesn't get done dirty, it's such a well produced, perfect track, even if it's the heaviest track on the album. I took a while to grow on me at first, I'll admit, but once it clicked, it clicked HARD. The melodic laugh in the middle there is incredibly iconic.

**Roxieloxie** (10): okay now if this wins it will in fact be deserved because i love this

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Rina is a fucking queen for directly calling out every-day discrimination, and destroying the expectation that she should be quiet and take it, when it’s the racist who needs to STFU. Unlike XS, this is NOT subtle at all in its nu-metal influence, and I LIVE for it.

**seanderlust** (10): as a former(?) evanescence stan....yes. this is everything.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): my job is high pressure and dealing w annoying client so i play this at work more than i'd care to admit

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): imma be honest this didnt click with me first. i was like... no way am i going to casually listen to this ever. i was wrong. i was so so wrong. stfu sweetie i am so sorry. this song is amazing please let the anger in your lives you'll feel better

**throwaway7650** (10): so many iconic moments in this song. the laugh into the note >>>

**TiltControls** (10): we rockheads now

**wasian-invasion** (10): i am a heavy metal lover

**wavingwolves** (10): she spilled when she went HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): ; the second best song on the album

**Dekubaku** (9.8): I listened to and enjoyed a metal-inspired song.

**fairytalehigh** (9.7): not me speeding down the highway cackling ""SHUT THE FUCK UP"" at every car that passes me

**urfavgalpal** (9.6): my favorite song to play when I feel annoyed",Awkward_King,,6,6,2021-05-30 21:04:40

The ultimate pre-game song (I say as a 17 year old who does not drink), it's so simple and so hype and is brilliant at what it does. This was the perfect lead single and I'm so proud of it charting, even if it deserved more. It was a brilliant start to the era and put eyes on them, which they retained until the album. I don't agree with the critiques of this using 'modern' slang making it weaker or more susceptible to aging, a lot in part because that way of speaking is mostly comprised of AAVE which has since been adapted to the mainstream and it feels... problematic to critique black musicians for using terms like that in their own music. Anyway. It's a bop :D

---

# do it

**conceptualromance** (11): they did it!!!!!!

**J\_Toe** (11): this is honestly the coolest track in the rate and I hope it wins. The whole album reminds me of Destiny's Child, but Do It sounds like Janet. if it was released in 2020.

**Qustomar** (11): This song is so satisfying to listen to, the production, the atmosphere, the vocals, everything is perfect. I love it so much, did a great job at introducing Chloe X Halle to a whole new audience like me!

**skargardin** (11): They SNAPPED!! This is so irresistably catchy and fun. Absolutely love it

**1998tweety** (10): this deserved to blow up wtf

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): A whole ass bop, a lovely highlight that again captures their strengths in making trap-influenced alternative R&B bangers.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): The song/video that started it all for me. I remember watching the music video last year and just being blown away.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That Uber on the way

**anothertown** (10): I know Scott Storch is seeing heaven ??

**bbfan132** (10): total bop, should’ve been bigger

**bespectacIed** (10): A MOMENT. My favorite pop moment of 2020 is this song and all the performances around it. They really had the recipe for stardom with this one: amazing visuals, unforgettable performances, and an honest to god awesome pop-R&B song. EXCEPT for the gp support smh. This not being a bigger hit than it was is just proof that life is meaningless and nothing matters

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This charted but it deserved to be a 10 week number one hit. Never trust the general public.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i cant believe they dropped the best pregame anthem in years and this fucking pandemic robbed us of using it

**CrimsonROSET** (10): its ok

**eeveefan01** (10): This song was one of the best songs of 2020. Would have been an 11 if ** wasn’t here.

**endcreditouilles** (10): this track look like bae

**engifear** (10): This string of 3 songs, ""Do It,"" ""Tipsy,"" and ""Ungodly Hour,"" is top-tier

**fadedblue09** (10): A rare song that is club-friendly and soulful at the same time, and such a mood lifter. I prefer the title track more, but this song deserves its success.

**frogaranaman** (10): I do a hard side-eye for anyone that doesn’t dig this song

**hakkerj** (10): Smash hit

**hunnybee12** (10): good vibes only ??

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic! Wish this actually blew up and was a massive hit. Such a bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I patiently await to see what sexual references people make with the title

**jaztinax** (10): they know how to pick their singles

**liberalitea** (10): TELL THE DJ PRESS PLAY REWIND KEEP IT ON REPEAT YESSSS MY BUSSY IS BOPPING MHMMM

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): invented quarantine mvs

**ManofOranges** (10): FUCKING BOPPPPPPP. That IS just how we do it girls. YUP YUP YUP. This song goes so hard, the video goes EVEN HARDER, it's LITERALLY so iconic to me. This song for me would get an 11 if XS was not in the rate because it's just so good to me. I believe it's actually one of my most scrobbled songs, which says a lot to me.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this deserved to blow up

**nootnoot781** (10): i’m sure i won’t be the only person doing the choreo whilst listening to this

**Oberionsynth** (10): ""girl, we so late"" is exactly how i feel when i realize i never listened to this song in the whole YEAR that it's been out

**pat-rickstar** (10): Me when I do it

**plastichaxan** (10): the other girlies don’t do it like them (even after hearing them say “and you can do it too”) :eyeroll:

**racloves** (10): I feel like I have played this song way too many times it’s concerning

**RandomHypnotica** (10): literally just the 100 emoji in song form

**runaway3212** (10): a whole bop

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This is such a refreshing partying song for being so laidback and carefree, truly turning the club into an oasis of chill (if we had clubs rn)

**savemeaseat143** (10): instant classic

**seanderlust** (10): i love the vibe of this

**shesdoingyoga** (10): We as a society failed by not letting this get to #1 on the charts

**sirpancakeXI** (10): I can't believe i listened to the remix version first than this, this is so much better.

**SupremeShani** (10): This is the literal definition of a bop, I know that term is so overused at this point, but this song deserved to smash so much. The twin's harmonizing here is so mesmerizing, the hooks are catchy, the way they blend their pop and R&B influences here into something so sultry and danceable, someone make this blow up on TikTok again or something.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): honestly i wasn't feeling this song when it first came out and almost didn't listen to the album but thank u popheads for making me listen anyway bc now it's one of my fave albums. any i disgress, song was a massive grower and a chill bop.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this song is so fucking good god where is that video of her throwing her ass in a circle to it when you need it

**TiltControls** (10): thinking of giving this a 10? do it

**Uberpigeon** (10): This gets a ten because of the amount of times in my day that ""I beat my face, Moving fast cause the uber on the way"" pops into my head

**urfavgalpal** (10): I love this one it’s so good.  And I love how it’s a hype song for Chloe and Halle that manages to include the listener with the “and you can do it too” so you feel like omg I could totally hang with them even though you know they’re cooler than you

**wasian-invasion** (10): this feels like it shouldve been a massive tiktok hit

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Deserved the grammy

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): This is the Truth hurts to my Juice, the make me feel to my screwed. Is this a good song, yes, but its not the best one on the album and it pains me everytime i only see people talk about this song. It also pains me because for some reason this is the song where i really need you all to go read up on your biases on AAVE and what it is because the amount of ' i dont like the tReNdY words they use in this, eww good vibes, 100,' like shut up you sound like the people who think the DaBaby version of levitating is 6 points worse than the original

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): CxH have the inate power to make me feel like a bad bitch no matter what I'm doing/what my mental state is

**Dekubaku** (9.5): Doing it so smoothly.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9.5): This is such a fun song and I love Halles voice on this

**iniekcja\_** (9.5): nobody ever dances to this song when I put it on at parties and honestly it is sad

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): while it's a smash, and easy to see why it was the song that took off, it actually isn't close to the best track on this album

**salivantsonority** (9.5): Banger.

**shhhneak** (9.5): IT’s a hit song for a reason.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.5): One of THE definitive songs from last year. So so SO well-crafted. I just love the vibe it creates and how fun it is",Awkward_King,,5,5,2021-05-30 21:12:08

Unsurprisingly, this was never not winning. Ungodly Hour put up a good fight, it was like 15/20 points behind until it kind of lagged among all the ballots in the last day, but not enough to overcome the power of what I will be calling Y2Communism. XS wasn't my introduction to Rina but it was the first song I became *obsessed* with by her, and I think that's the case for a lot of people. STFU! and Comme Des Garcons were both bangers, but XS really captures the moods of both of them and manages to smash them together while also being quite poignant commentary on the excess of western life. The haunting almost mystic intro, into the collection of heavy drum smashes into what could honestly be a Pussycat Dolls song from 2005 is, imo, one of the singest greatest musical moments of last year - So it's fitting it's the winner here.

# sexy bitches who read marxist theory

**\_SoulGlitch** (11): Fuck capitalism and consumerism. - sent from my iPhone I got one and a half years ago and that I haven’t finished paying off.

**anothertown** (11): this is definitely one of the songs of all time

**CarlieScion** (11): everybody always laughs at me when I say I think of this as a sexy song but it’s like…. Satire that makes Capitalism SexyTM and none of y’all will be able to take that from me!!!!!!!!!!!

**celladonn** (11): The only song ever

**Dekubaku** (11): XS? More like XL in terms of how amazing this song is.

**EnCaine** (11): hello favorite pop song of 2020

**hikkaru** (11): i just thought it was the best song i'd ever heard

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (11): ugh this song is the favorite to win so I dont really WANT it to be my 11 but it totally is and I understand why. this is an anti-consumerism banger

**ignitethephoenix** (11): truly one of the best pop songs from last year. I feel so basic giving this my 11 but it definitely deserves

**JunkyGS** (11): I hope the cliche of this being the winner doesn't make people overlook and forget how truly incredible this song is. An asian popstar being unapologetically fearless with their instrumental choice and song topic, the production being able to show its influences but be fresh, the very clever song writing to fit the theme but still flow super well and the range of vocals provided. When you look at all of these factors and combine them.... there truly is no other song like this in the history of pop music.

**ManofOranges** (11): RINA DID NOT JUST GIVE MORE SHE GAVE EVERYTHINGGGGGG ON THIS SONG. Something something Karl Marx found dead. Something something oh me oh my. Bottom line, if this song doesn't win I'm starting a revolution.

**martian\_pet** (11): AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!

**nootnoot781** (11): does anyone else think global warming is a bad thing? i love rina sawayama. i think she’s a really interesting artist.

**plastichaxan** (11): predictable maybe but when it’s right it’s right

**pros-and-connors** (11): Rina made a song satirizing excessive consumption and capitalism that is simultaneously an amazing piece of satire and a even better gimme anthem than 7 Rings or Fabulous (from High School Musical 2). We have no choice but to stan!

**RandomHypnotica** (11): As much as I would've loved to give my 11 to something else, there really was no other choice than XS. I remember first discovering Rina when I did the 2017 EP Rate. I was listening to the playlist in order, and I must've accidentally hit shuffle, and 10-20-40 started playing. I was hooked instantly. I went through the rest of the RINA EP, and I loved every single song. It was such an amazing experience, realising you've just discovered a new favourite artist. To this day, the RINA EP is still one of my favourite music projects ever, and most of the songs, but in particular 10-20-40 and Cyber Stockholm Syndrome are some of my top favourite of all time tracks. After a while, we started getting loose singles from Rina. Valentine, Cherry and Flicker. They were all really fun, cute songs, but nothing that really stood up to the same quality as the EP. But I wasn't worried, because these weren't album cuts. Eventually, STFU! came out as the first single. I really did like that track, but it was a very different sound, and Rina admitted as much, so I wasn't too worried. Then CDG came out. It's very much a great song again, but once again, it wasn't living up to the quality of the EP in my head. Was I setting my expectations way too high? Was I never going to feel quite that level of adoration and amazement that I did with the Rina EP?. Then XS happened. Instantly I got that same feeling as I did from the RINA EP, the excitement at how fresh this sounded, how instantly iconic and catchy. How perfect. It was the moment that really solidifed Rina as an all-time favourite artist for me. Of course, SAWAYAMA ended up being a fantastic album, and even if I don't love the entire project front to back as much as I do with RINA, XS will always continue to be one of my favourite songs, and definitely deserving of my 11.

**ReallyCreative** (11): I know we hate predictable winners but girls, let's look at the material. She deserves it.

**rickikardashian** (11): i really cant picture a scenario where this doesnt win and honestly i hope i dont have to witness it:)

**sarcasticsobs** (11): GIMME JUST A LITTLE BIT. MORE.

**SFbby** (11): GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT MOREEEEEEEE of this grade A pop banger

**shesdoingyoga** (11): Honestly most of the songs on SAWAYAMA could get my 11 but I’m picking the one that probably has the best chance of winning because I like winning

**SinfulAnarchy** (11): the way she singlehandedly dismantled capitalism with this song

**slimboyfriend** (11): I was going to give my 11 to a CRJ song I liked more, but this song distills everything Rina does well: Boiling a gargantuan theme down to 3 minutes of catchy off-kilter pop music. So congrats.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): for some reason I always mishear the first word of the second verse and assume it's the f-slur

**steelstepladder** (11): Im in my basic bitch era

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): it serves britney. it serves 90s r&b. it serves engaging social commentary. it serves that one reaction picture of miranda cosgrove on the set of icarly with blue hair.... while also serving that one reaction pic of paris hilton wearing the stop being poor shirt. the mv served story and visuals on a budget. she served us what is quite literally the best song ever created. literally what more can we ask for? that being said... [Intro] More ????????????

**waluigiest** (11): best pop song of 2020 I stay obsessed

# no iphone

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): If this track wins the rate, so be it, honestly, what a phenomenal anti-capitalist banger and a half. Not only is it clever in its wordplay (XS, get it, excess which is synonymous with more, and XS for extra small? I see it. Haha.) but the homage to early 2000s ""classic"" pop works wonders. What an idiosyncratic instrumental too, with the plucked guitars, that super dramatic string opening, the banging breakdown that happens before the chorus. This song flopping is just another piece of evidence for the GP's lack of taste.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a rate winner

**Alumineous** (10): Seeeeeeexxx when all that's left is immaterial.

**amiriteor** (10): i actually am a fucking capitalist in my juicy track suit

**bbfan132** (10): a rocker and a bop all at once

**bespectacIed** (10): I don't want to be too salty about this song being the winner. I love this song so much. Excellent production and thoughtful lyrics about materialism? Yes please. It's just that it's realllllyyy not the best song on the album...it's Bad Friend

**bigbigbee** (10): I’ve said this elsewhere, but – the two white actors playing the TV announcers in this MV didn’t have to go that hard. But they did. they did it for us.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Karl Marx found resurrected only to die again.

**camerinian** (10): “Rina Sawayama, a member of the RADICAL LEFT FEMINIST DEMOCRATS wants to seize the means of production, yet her song is produced by Kyle Shearer, Chris Lyon, Valley Girl? Curious” - Charlie Kirk, Turning Point USA

**cashewconstellation** (10): perfect, this is actually my 100th listen

**conceptualromance** (10): ended capitalism etc etc etc

**cremeebrulee** (10): like i said with blinding lights, sometimes the most obvious winner IS the right one. i would love to see cxh pull an upset just because they’re the underdogs here but i will not say no to an anti-captialism bop either

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): not a lot of people could make a fun pop song about consumerism and capitalism criticism but she succeeds. As always I love her rock influences.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): My goodness, the way Rina tackled capitalism in a pop perfection of a song is so fucking genius. This is the main pop girl that we are waiting for tbh.",Awkward_King,,5,5,2021-05-30 21:50:37

**Overall Average**: 8.336 **// Average Controversy:** 1.603

**bespectacIed** (10.071): Best album of 2020. Has there been a modern pop album that touched more non-romantic topics than SAWAYAMA? Self-confidence, family, friendship, Asian identity, materialism... even the only song tangentially romantic in this album (tokyo love hotel) is a Mitski-esque song about culture difference. All these themes tied together by such pristine, forward-thinking, and catchy production. When we overhype Rina in these spaces, we are not doing it enough!!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10.000): this is quite possibly my favorite album of all time. it's one of my most listened to albums ever. i love it dearly and i will be rating it as such. it's so rare for me to come across a body of work that i adore all parts of the whole, and all of them here are so intricate and unique. and they all slap. she tackles something different lyrically, thematically, and sonically on every track here and she fucking nails it. rina did what she had to do and i love her for it. like... truly... what a time to be alive. anyways stream sawayama

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.679): THE 2020 album of the year. Seriously one of my absolute favorite albums of all time. Every single song is immaculately crafted and tells such a vivid story that is so deeply personal and yet also deeply relatable. I can’t believe it’s Rina’s debut album because it has the seasoned flair of a very experienced musician. Not to be all “I knew her before she got big,” but I am proud that I’ve been following her since Cyber Stockholm Syndrome and now she’s one of the music world’s critical darlings. Ugh... it’s what she deserves.

**conceptualromance** (9.607): This is my favorite album from last year. She is the moment!

**moooo566** (9.607): Wow it's the best album of 2020. Can I give a 10 to every single song or is that prohibited as reverse sabotage?

**Dekubaku** (9.586): One of the best albums I have ever heard! The variety, the mood, the themes, the production, perfection!

**kirby31200** (9.571): 2020 AOTY. A nearly perfect 10/10

**ReallyCreative** (9.500): I was anticipating this album for so long and it delivered on every front. Dynasty is one of the best songs ever made, point blank period. XS is all the hype and more, a masterclass in nostalgia-pop while staying fresh and interesting. Bad Friend is everything. All the bops in between are everything. My album of 2020.

**liberalitea** (9.500): This is honestly the definition of a no-skip album. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th listens are just as good as the 1st and I just don't get tired of it- in face I may even discover more gems. Such an incredible debut and she manages to address such complex topics so well and I love the Y2K sound inspiration but also the fact she doesn't stick to one specific genre. Amazing album.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.414): The RINA EP is one of my favourite music projects of all time, and I was worried SAWAYAMA wouldn't be able to live up to it. While it isn't quite as consitent as RINA to me, I still absolutely love SAWAYAMA, and Rina continues to prove her excellence, and that she's only going upwards from here.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.400): easily top 3 albums of 2020

**pat-rickstar** (9.393): My #1 favourite album of 2020, I just love how eclectic it is in terms of genre/sound and lyrical content. There are no songs on here about romance, love or breakups which is honestly so refreshing.

**Alumineous** (9.357): Immigrated at a young age? Friend ghoster? Immigrant identity clashes? Experienced microaggressions? Felt insecure? Disowned by your parents? Check, check, check, check, check and check! Wow. This was a very personal record for me. I didn't know Rina before the pandemic, and I'm grateful to have discovered it. Finally, I have to note that SAWAYAMA was one of the albums that got me into the subreddit. I loved how we all experienced this pandemic with this music and discussed it together. And I decided to stick around. Y'all are a fun bunch.

**plastichaxan** (9.314): no one is truly doing it like Rina, this album is just her exploring and proving how great she is at everything, this album was such a moment for me last year and i hope it’s not hard to see why

**anothertown** (9.214): cries

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.143): I listened to the album one time before this rate. It didn't give me a strong impression but I was willing to listen to the album again because I probably didn't get the concept and the lyrics at that time. This rate was the perfect time to revisit the album and wow, I am so glad I looked at the lyrics because I heavily resonated with the topics that Rina tackled in this album. As an Asian diaspora kid who grew up in a foreign country and consumed Western media, this is the album that felt like it was tailored-made for me by a fellow Asian immigrant. Thank you Rina for making this album, for all of us Asian diaspora kids.

**steelstepladder** (9.086): YAAAAAAAAAAAAS

**skargardin** (9.071): Pretty crazy to think of how strong this debut is.

**notarobot3675** (9.057): my album of the year 2020, just... what a perfect debut

**akanewasright** (8.921): Genuinely, Rina deserves the fucking world. She could do no wrong for me over the past year and a half.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.893): A record with a rich, diverse palette of influences, genres, lyrical themes, and emotions that are so well-evoked by Rina's singing, SAWAYAMA is one of the most captivating albums of 2020 that puts onto display her tremendous vocal abilities and her knack of crafting slightly off-kilter yet thoroughly enjoyable and sometimes even radiantly beautiful pop songs. Rina proves that she can do it all, and all while marching to the beat of her own drum. Sidenote if you see my SAWAYAMA reviews are way more detailed than the others is because I thought I could put in the effort for the whole thing but gave up after one record... FML.

**jsonphile** (8.893): the first time I listened to this was back in September I was blown away by how good this was. I had heard great things from fellow popheads but even with high expectations going in it still blew me away. Not even exaggerating, this has become one of my top ten albums of all time I love it so much. I don’t know if it’ll stay there or if over time I may start to like it less but I’ve listened to this dozens of times over the last several months and I’m still not tired of it. You go Rina

**ggal2020** (8.879): remember when this and Fetch the Bolt Cutters came out on the same night? I hate to say it, but that was a cultural reset

**bookthieving** (8.679): wow music really hits different when someone with a background similar to yours writes about their experiences and you can relate to them

**Roxieloxie** (8.671): I think the first half fucks slightly more but overall i had fun

**sirpancakeXI** (8.643): i honestly did not expect this to have my highest average when the rate is being announced, but it just keep growing and growing on me

**EnCaine** (8.643): rina is 2/2 right now with RINA and SAWAYAMA and i hope she keeps up the excellence

**wasian-invasion** (8.607): I loved Cherry and Alterlife but for some reason never really listened to anything else in her discography. This didn't click immediately either, but after like the third listen or so, it's probably in my top 4 for the year for how consistently good and sonically diverse it is. Happy to see rina get the critical acclaim she deserves, now lets just hope she breaks through to the gp in her next era

**shhhneak** (8.593): I remember putting this album off for weeks after it was released because I didn’t trust the hype. My jaw was on the floor within the first minute of Dynasty.

**ImADudeDuh** (8.571): smasha

**poptartchill** (8.536): This was one of my favorite albums of 2020. I would like to thank this sub for hyping it up enough that I listened to it the day it came out so I never had to suffer in a world where this album came out and I didn't know about it. I love the rock influences especially. It's so cohesive yet all the songs are SO different. Overall amazing album.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.500): Clarence Clarity is the only good Clarity we've ever rated.

**SmileAndTears** (8.493): best pop album of 2020 (along WYP) yup yup yup

**Palutzel** (8.450): this album gets better with every listen, so many bops, really hope Rina gets huge

**AHSWeeknd** (8.429): Day 3 of this rate is just gonna be a listening party for this album. Without Chosen Family.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.414): As I did to Ungodly Hour, I slept on it for a while. I just couldn't understand what Rina was doing here. The tracks sounded so weird and messy. Fortunately, I woke up just in time to give it another try and it has really grown on me since. There's just a couple of tracks that I don't love so much, but they're no skips at all. I listen to the entirety of this album and when it finishes I just want to press replay, which I end up doing every time hahahah. My second favorite off of this rate for sure.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.386): Another one of my favorite albums from last year, I’m so excited to see what she does next. Rina can do so many different kind of sounds well and it’s refreshing to hear that.

**jasannn** (8.321): I don't know how she did it but she made a bunch songs over many different genres and sounds that still managed to sound cohesive and personal. This would be my 2020 AOTY if it weren't for Future Nostalgia and folklore.

**jman457** (8.314): I slightly prefer her EP, but its still one of the strongest debut album in years

This was my immediate favourite from the album and while I don't think it's still my absolute favourite, it's still so goddamn good. I love how the rhythms of the song actually sound tipsy, as some people have pointed out in their comments. I like the evolution of the idea of being drunk on someone, and because you're quote on quote tipsy you're more loose-lipped with the idea of being like ""if you hurt me i'm gonna fucking kill you"", I just think that's a smart way they wrote the song and I really appreciate it, I also enjoy songs about men dying!!

---

# i may have slightly traumatised roxie with my constant fake spoilers about this song's placement...

**CreepyMannequin** (11): I love this song. It’s infectious, it’s fun, it’s a bop.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (11): I was instantly obsessed with this song the first time I heard it. It's just so much fun, such a bop, and the ""better, treat me better"" runs are such an earworm

**Roxieloxie** (11): Im obsessed with this song so fucking much. I love angry girl pop anthems (which is probably why the only [redacted] song i can stand is blank space) I just love how this song plays around with the 'kill men :men:' concept that so often on yt women get to play around with. Like the truly just bubblegum murderness of 'boy dont play with me, i will fucking kill you with a smile on my face and still show up at sunday dinner with your mother :) <3' like just the immaculate southern gothic sexy horror of it all

**anothertown** (10): don’t you just want to go ape shitt

**bigbigbee** (10): I REALLY love this song; I think it’s incredibly musically interesting. There’s some unusual harmony in the verses that almost make it sound off-key (to my untrained ear), even though it’s not, obviously. And I don’t mean that in a bad way. It makes you pay attention, and then when you hit those gorgeous, more standard harmonies in the chorus and the bridge, they stand out even more in comparison.

**CarlieScion** (10): a winner mayhaps

**cremeebrulee** (10): if chloe and halle murdered me do not prosecute them they caught ME slipping ok

**Dekubaku** (10): Found this hidden gem when listening to the album for the rate. Holy shit! Everyone should be listening to this!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Queens of committing a murder while being under a Disney contract!

**endcreditouilles** (10): honestly it was so hard to pick between this, title track, and Do It for my 11, just pretend this is an 11 ok

**engifear** (10): Honestly if they murdered someone it would be a #girlboss move and I support them

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The production on this song is so nutty, it feels like it’s sliding around on my brain. It works well to give this that “off-kilter” vibe that backs up the characters they’re playing here.

**hikkaru** (10): oh to be murdered by chloe and halle

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Love a good men murdering anthem lol. Definitely one of the highlights on here for sure

**jayjaysortagay** (10): ???? end all men ???? except me lmfao

**juanolsen** (10): i love songs about killing men, also the fact that this song was produced by Chloe herself and is the best produced song in the album makes it even better

**KennyEarthman** (10): the way Halle says tipsy really makes this song

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): invented murder, also 2:01

**musical\_pyn** (10): one time I was singing the chorus under my breath and a friend screamed, turns out the part I was singing was going through his head at the exact same time. In conclusion, listening to chloe x halle gives you telepathy

**nootnoot781** (10): what a killer song

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this went on my new faves playlist the moment I heard it. goodbye earl's daughter

**pheromenos** (10): best song period

**plastichaxan** (10): this is just extremely fun i love it

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song is just. perfection. it's actual perfection. if i didn't love wasting my 11s, i'd choose this. It's clever, it's well-written, and i love the chorus effects.

**poptartchill** (10): SO GOOD! such a fun song!

**ReallyCreative** (10): misandry anthem

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The way this is more subversive than any edgy try-hard song about serial killers made by an industrial dude (just say Suicide Commando). They literally murdered the songwriting game with this. A clever bop that’s as unsettling as it is mischievous, playful and fun.

**skargardin** (10): songs to kill boys to

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): just fantastic, don't FUCK up

**urfavgalpal** (10): If I gave this album my 11 it would be this one but yeah this is the best song on the album.  Best song about murdering a man since Goodbye, Earl

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Few songs are able to elicit a physical reaction from me… but when I heard Tipsy’s second verse for the first time, I literally GASPED

**Vromega** (10): I was really surprised listening to this mysterious first verse. and then a fantastic chorus comes and suddenly everything made sense musically. Great production, gorgeous background vocals

**Vultuxe** (10): I know Tipsy will be a day 1 song but I wish people would hear what I hear with it. I think this song is so creative and silly, while being a total fucking banger. Whatever the production is doing in the chorus is addicting.

**wavingwolves** (10): real misandrists will give this a score above 9.9

**fairytalehigh** (9.6): the tipsy/crazy rhyme + their delivery is soooo catchy

**savemeaseat143** (9.6): melody sounds tipsy somehow

**camerinian** (9.5): More murder ballads from main pop girls pls

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): trend alert…murder that man

**kirby31200** (9.5): Gaslight gatekeep girlboss

**SupremeShani** (9.5): chloe and halle really are out here killing m*n and singing about it, popheads fan favorite right here

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): Cruella be like “yes, this will be my wedding song.”

**AHSWeeknd** (9): not one of my faves off the album but it goes all the way

**astrologicalangel** (9): love me a casual murder anthem

**bespectacIed** (9): Fun

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): They had it comin'

**Brendon-Urine** (9): definitely had to warm up to this one. kinda hated it on my first listen, it sounds... dumb (which is the point obv) but it's also really fun and I love it now. Like this song SOUNDS tipsy.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I now realized this album would be great with some wine

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): The verses and the pre-choruses carry this.

**EnCaine** (9): okay okay so i cant figure out how to word this thought, but i love really like this in the same way I like black heart by crj. there's a playfulness and type of delivery they have that i adore

**fadedblue09** (9): Very fun and flirty

**jaztinax** (9): i prefer the spotify singles version tho but why would we rate a song about murdering boys anything lower than a 9 anyways?

**liberalitea** (9): this is such a fun song and i can't believe chloe produced this herself. the ending is so good with the ""dum dum"" in the background

**Oberionsynth** (9): queens of killing their man and acting innocent around the family

**pig-serpent** (9): They should make more uptempo songs like this one.

**racloves** (9): go girls get his ass

**salivantsonority** (9): Great don't fuck with me energy; I love the spoken quality of the vocals in the verses. Just a fun song.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Misandry anthem

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): Queens of murdering lovers

**Uberpigeon** (8.7): I really wasnt expecting a song about killing your boyfriend from CxH when I first listened, but im so glad that i got it. Its also no coincidence that one of the best produced songs was produced by Chloe herself

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is camp

**throwaway7650** (8.5): ""I've been charged with murder"" - Chloe x Halle after their VMAs ungodly hour performance because they KILLED IT. love this song's lyrics!

**welcometoNY** (8.5): love a good homicide anthem

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): I LOVE the lyrics here, and I want to love this song, but the instrumental feels really lacking to me, it just sounds kinda messy and muddy.",Awkward_King,,4,4,2021-05-30 19:22:18

IT'S JUST SO FUN!! FUCK YOU CREME!! I didn't really know what citypop was before I'd heard this, but now a year later, being more versed in music I'd like to think, it's wild how perfect of a definition that is for this style - It really feels like I'm just stood in Leicester Square staring up at all the lights and the billboards and just letting the city envelop me and it is such a nice feeling. I grew up in the city but moved away as a young teenager so it feels like quite a nostalgic and comforting place to me, which I think is why this song feels so purely joyous.

---

# living their best life, thrivin'

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): As an Asian kid who grew up in a foreign country with strict parents, this is like the pop-rock anthem that my teenage/young adult self has been looking for all his life. I would often rebel by telling my parents that I would be home early only to return home at almost midnight and I would blame the traffic for it lmao. Good times.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): My Life as a Teenage Robot theme song fucking SLAPPED

**afs** (10): Anime intro now... this girl is trying everything and doing great at it. AND it has a saxophone. AND it has a key change.

**anothertown** (10): this has existential breakdown juice in it

**bespectacIed** (10): Probably my least favorite song on the album but I cannot give this less than a 10, it's still an excellent track. Love the 8-bit realness

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I put this on in the whip and a friend said it sounds like it should play on Rainbow Road

**cashewconstellation** (10): i love this song so much, it's so..... carefree, rebellious, i love it

**celladonn** (10): This just captures a specific atmosphere so perfectly

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Hi creme!

**fadedblue09** (10): This feels so carefree, and that key change in the final chorus...yas

**frogaranaman** (10): this song is such a fucking MOOOOOD

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Rina uses a lot of throwback ‘90s/’00s pop sounds in her music and I think it works best when she’s actually using that sound to help comment on what she’s singing about, like on “Ordinary Superstar” where it’s a commentary on ’00s pop icons or on here, where the dated sound palate and almost cartoonish production evoke the nostalgia and youthful carefreeness of the lyrics. Probably my favorite song on the album actually.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Oh fuck!

**liberalitea** (10): this song makes me wanna be a teen and then i remember im 17

**nootnoot781** (10): another song i don’t understand the hate for. it’s so happy and cheesy in a good way unlike one of her other songs

**NotWith10000Men** (10): the chorus is bottled sunshine and OH FUCK THERE'S A SAX

**plastichaxan** (10): euphoria in music form (the feeling not the show)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Anyone who scores this below a 9 was definitely born after 2003

**ReallyCreative** (10): she saw the gays can't drive and said ""let me make a driving anthem to commit vehicular felonies to""

**Roxieloxie** (10): I would 11 this if not for CxH, the first time I heard it i became obsessed with it. Its so bouncy and fun and feels like its the theme song for a show or a game from the early 2000s and I truly love that so much

**shhhneak** (10): The 2000s sound effects and references to MSN Messenger? This is camp. Take me back.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this song is so fucking FUN. like... please give it recognition it deserves. i will never trust anyone who hears this and does not have a good time

**TiltControls** (10): this is a bop and deserves more love!

**waluigiest** (10): the chorus was my biggest source of joy in spring 2020

**akanewasright** (9.9): My immediate favorite from the album and a true delight of a song.

**Dekubaku** (9.9): Wasn't expecting such a happy song given the heavy themes of the album but it fits!

**savemeaseat143** (9.9): next best teen tv show intro

**wavingwolves** (9.8): the mention of MSN messenger makes me feel so old

**fairytalehigh** (9.7): this song makes me feel like i'm in the casino stage of a sonic the hedgehog game and a cartoon cat croupier has just handed me a hit of poppers

**camerinian** (9.5): Never has a song made me want to join a spin class more

**CrimsonROSET** (9.5): WE LOVE TO SEE IT!

**jsonphile** (9.5): put a sax solo and a key change in a song and oooh I’m there

**juanolsen** (9.5): i know some people don't like it but this one is actually one of my favorite songs from the album, it captures the pure essence of adolescent rebellion so accurately and fun that i can't help but smile Everytime u hear it

**notarobot3675** (9.5): this is such a fun song that i feel gets lost in this album of stellar pop songs. it really does have that youthful energy of a rebellious teen, and idk if ive ever heard a pop song that explores that relationship between parent and kid during those years

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.5): I loooooove the 2000’s teen movie this song gives me. It’s so punchy and wistful and just sounds like teen rebellion

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): The only thing that holds this back is that the instrumental might be a tad too barebones for me, but it's still a fun, thoroughly enjoyable song that is a little bit of a palette cleanser after Akasaka Sad; love the transition, the key change is decent enough. Again with the different genres of pop - great shimmering, kind of bitpop-inspired, carefree instrumental that pairs with Rina's own carefree reminiscing of her own youthful escapades. Like who needs the FBI when you have Rina's mom, really?

**amiriteor** (9): gained a point for the beginning on headphones

**bbfan132** (9): super fun!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This song makes me nostalgic for a childhood/adolescence I definitely did not have lol. Also that sax.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): idk this is just the perfect warm weather vibe song

**musical\_pyn** (9): I was super surprised to find out people don't like this, this was one of my favorites on initial listen, just so different from the rest of the album while still being rina

**poptartchill** (9): it's just so catchy!!

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Is there a version of this somewhere without the overly long intro? That version is a 10

**Stryxen** (9): this song is about me and the girls in beatsense

**SupremeShani** (9): i definitely relate to this because i totally rebelled against my parents when i was a kid and had an exciting childhood yup yup, but for real though, she literally ended this with a sax solo and a key change, literally has popheads by its balls

**thedoctordances1940** (9): Absolute Bop

**Turpamutteri** (9): this was the standout track when I first listened to the album

**vayyiqra** (9): Unironically, only 90s kids will remember this. It captures a lot of highly specific things about growing up in the 2000s very well.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Honestly surprised to see a track like this on this album… It’s so fun and unabashedly bubblegum pop-y!

**salivantsonority** (8.7): I think this is the most underrated track on the record. Just joyful.

**urfavgalpal** (8.7): lowkey traumatized by this song because it’s my island theme song on Animal Crossing and I haven’t visited my island in so long and I just know that my villagers are gonna be upset that I haven’t talked to them in so long and there will be so many weeds and I’m just so scared to open the game again.  Anyway I like this a lot!  Very fun gives me some retro vibes.  Kinda reminds me of the song “paradisin by the dashboard light” idk if that’s the right name for that song because I only ever knew the Glee version but that’s the vibe I get from it.  Great and relatable

**vagenda** (8.6): I feel like I hear people hating on this song often….couldn’t be me

**jasannn** (8.5): Every great album needs amazing summer song.

**Qustomar** (8.5): The way people hate on this song feels like a personal attack towards me?

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): It sounds like she's telling her life story on a sugar rush over a Sonic the Hedgehog instrumental

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): BOP

**throwaway7650** (8.5): like the song and I like the lyrics even more. so relatable

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): I've never heard a song about overprotective parents like this before and its a really cool song idea

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): ooh an asian mom song, didn’t know I needed this",Awkward_King,,5,5,2021-05-30 19:30:44

I'm so glad I included this in the rate because it's such a brilliantly crafted pop song, it's so fun melodically and the subject matter is very simple and exact, but well done! Elio and Charli work brilliantly here together, and I still need to get into more of Elio's stuff beyond this and u and me but mostly me. I don't know if I'd call this outlasting Born To Play an upset but? I don't think people expected it. And the results were fucking *close* too.

---

**Vultuxe** (10): I'm biased towards ELIO, a few of their songs are stellar and CHARGER is one of them.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is WAYYY better than it has any right to be, the original was a cute moment, but the addition of Charli just elevates it another level

**ReallyCreative** (9): ELIO's album/EP thing is actually a really great listen, I recommend, and Charli takes this already good track and adds some fun elements to it

**racloves** (8): is it controversial to say I think I slightly prefer the original elio version

# should all check out more of elio's stuff :DDD

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): one of my fav Charli features

**bigbigbee** (10): This was my favorite surprise in the bonus rate. It’s so cute.

**liberalitea** (10): one of my favourite Charli features and it's a sound that I miss from her. Just her vocals really.

**pig-serpent** (10): The instrumental on this song is really good and the hook is really catchy. I'm trying not to overly Charli stan here, but this is easily my favorite discovery of this rate

**nick1372** (9.5): Love how this takes something so simple into something so dramatic

**fadedblue09** (9): This slaps actually

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): banger

**skargardin** (9): hold on this bops hard af

**Palutzel** (8.6): bop

**jasannn** (8.5): This is why you have two chargers.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): cute bop

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): Had to listen a few times to recognize Charli’s voice on this, they sound a lot alike - it’s a fun and catchy song.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): first time I'm hearing this and I really like the vibe but it kinda feels incomplete

**bespectacIed** (8): never heard of this, this is fun??

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): That chorus alone is a 10

**fairytalehigh** (8): perfectly pleasant song but it hardly even registers as a charli feature. i put it on a playlist and heard it half a dozen times before i even noticed.

**hikkaru** (8): cute bop

**KennyEarthman** (8): really picks up at the last minute

**LostintheCosmicFire** (8): I love her voice on this one

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Ok i’m normally not into this flavor of dance music but… that was pretty fire

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): ohhh when that beat comes in at 2 minutes

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): ok ok this is good

**throwaway7650** (7.5): ""final"" (? this song is so short) chorus is really good

**wavingwolves** (7.1): this is cute

**AHSWeeknd** (7): What a fun little bop

**bbfan132** (7): pleasant song to chill out to

**runaway3212** (8): cute but not amazing

**jman457** (6.9): cute song, nothing really special though

**urfavgalpal** (6.3): I don’t think Charli’s verse does much of anything here?  The song is cute enough and I’m sure if I listened to it 50 times in a row I would love it but I don’t really feel much of s connection to it

**frogaranaman** (6): it’s cute but basically the original song as far as I can tell

I played the fuck out of this when it came out, to the point where as good as it obviously is it doesn’t like pack quite the emotional punch it did straight away, but god it’s good. I think many people agree with the sentiment that this feels very nostalgic of the beginning of the pandemic, still hopeful but also quite sorrowful. The song really feels like a warm hug if I’m honest, the outro is heavenly and the melody of the chorus just feels like bliss. Honestly, I memed Jules' comment of this in the banner, but it's a really nice story and does a better job of encapsulating feelings linked to this song than I ever could so give that a read!

---

# i will always love you, i'll love this song forever, even when its not top 10

**\_\_Avaritia** (11): Lovely, sentimental, love the analogy of an AI professing its love in a robotic apocalypse, just the right amount of distortion along with how dramatic it is

**bigbigbee** (11): I know that separation from our loved ones can make people feel really sad during the pandemic, and this song may invoke those feelings of missing/emptiness for some people. For me, though, this song makes me feel love, first and foremost; Charli repeating “I love you forever” is like a reassuring mantra for me. I do love you all, my friends. I’ll love you forever. I’ll see you on the other side!

**Brendon-Urine** (11): best song of the rate, best song of 2020, best song of the decade so far, THE definitive quantine song, shall I continue? (for real this is a life-defining song for me I absolutely could keep going)

**hunnybee12** (11): when the music video dropped i watched it on loop and just cried about how miserable quarantine was making me :)))) anyways this song and album are really special to me and arrived when I really needed it

**joeeswift** (11): one of three songs to ever make me cry, charli should be honoured

**nooodisaster** (11): A fucking masterpiece. There's so much emotion in this: sorrow at time moving past a relationship, hope that the memory will still stay, maturity that both things can be true. The song feels like it's tearing itself apart during the bridge from the sheer weight of it all. Add the extra layer of meaning that when this song released no one could see anyone and the nostalgia for simply existing (which the mv captured brilliantly), and you have the highlight of this project.

**Raykel** (11): I'm always a fan of Charli's more upbeat songs, so the fact that I fell in love with this song as much as I did really subverted my expectations. It's so comforting. Even if the subject is bittersweet, it gives me nostalgia for past friendships/relationships. The intro is my favorite in her discog. It gives me the same feeling I get when falling, except I land in the rest of the song's warm blanket.

**runaway3212** (11): so I get very drunk one night and this was the only song I wanted to hear that entire night, I was with one friend and she got so so annoyed at me, but gave into me anyway, I started playing it at like 10 pm and when I woke up the next day at 9 am it was still playing. I didn't listen to it ever after that until this rate, but I do genuinely think it's the best song here, it's fun but also tackles insecurity in relationships, which is one of my favourite themes in music, furthermore it really goes deep into the 'i hate the silence, that's why the music's always loud' part of hyperpop, showcasing that behind the loud noises, artists are hiding their true feeling and insecurities and the loud noises just give more meaning to these emotions in my opinion.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): Without fail, I start crying a little when the third minute kicks in. Charli’s vulnerability in bracing for the worst in the future while cherishing the memories of the past moves me to my core. Hyperpop is often said to be a style cloaked in irony, but the harsh sounds here just bring out Charli’s raw sincerity and lovely melodies even more, sounding like a literal emotional breakdown while she sings the heartbreakingly simple sentiment of “I’ll love you forever, even when we’re not together”.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (11): me and my friends made it into the video and it just makes me so emotional, i love this song sm its v special to me

**bbfan132** (10): didn’t totally click with me at first but i love it now - i particularly love the whooshing sound in the background lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Not only a super touching song, but easily the best ""quarantine music video"" I saw last year.

**CarlieScion** (10): bop

**celladonn** (10): The video is an 11

**cremeebrulee** (10): the chanel to stuck with u’s walmart

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I mean, this was a moment. Early quarantine this got me on my feeling a LOT. I’ve ugly cried to this song before.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): When this song first came out, it hit me that we were truly experiencing the pandemic universally. It's a bittersweet feeling about not being sure when you are able to see our loved ones for a while when going out (with not much information about the virus at that time compared now) is a huge risk. This is the case for me when I heard this song again for the rate and it hit me that I haven't seen my friends physically for a year now. This song is definitely a quarantine anthem and the music video is a reflection of that feeling. When I hear this song years after the pandemic is over, I will remember the bittersweet feelings I had over that song when I miss seeing my friends and being able to go out freely. And gosh, I can't blame Charli for writing this emotional ballad for her boyfriend cause damn he can get it. I hope Charli and Huck Kwong stick together forever. ?

**fairytalehigh** (10): the brightest spot of the beginning of the godless hellhole of 2020, with an instantly iconic MV to boot

**frogaranaman** (10): this shit go wild

**ggal2020** (10): the song that defined early quarantine for me. every time I listen to it I’m transported back to early quarantine, trying to get into charli’s zoom raves and spinning around my room to this song on repeat.

**hakkerj** (10): The video makes me cry

**iniekcja\_** (10): Charli is one of the few artists that have love songs I actually like

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): I think for a solid week, I was just playing this, “Busy Boy”, and “Ungodly Hour” (spoiler alert for some of my faves in this rate lmao) back to back to back as though no other songs existed. To me, I love dedicating this song to my various boys that I’ve fallen in infatuation with but I know it’ll never progress into something huge.

**Leixander** (10): alexa, what is the definition of bittersweet perfection?

**ManofOranges** (10): There's something just so sweet and genuine about this song. It really does perfectly give across the feeling of ""I'll love you forever.""

**nick1372** (10): it’s really incredible how this song captures the sweet feeling of being with someone you love but there’s this almost imperceptible sad undertone to it that’s pure genius

**Palutzel** (10): such a beautiful song, it throws me back to the lockdown

**pig-serpent** (10): I love the haziness of this song (sorry CxH). It's a great song just to let the sound wash over you, and the growing decent into noise is fairly unique for this type of song.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): so this song makes me weep every time without fail. it's so heartfelt and then thinking about SOPHIE and i just UGH. i don't know if it's getting older and reflecting on my own friendships. but as someone who falls hard and falls fast in friendship love, i have def felt this frenetic, desperate energy because you want so much of somebody and you know that you'll always be connected, except that you won't. but they will still always have a place in your heart, even after they have moved on, or they are gone forever. UGH.",Awkward_King,,3,3,2021-05-30 19:37:40

If I'm being honest (and a little rude), I never quite bought Rina's explanation that this song was about toxic masculinity and was anything more than a flex song, which I live for in itself, I just always felt like that was a kinda failed attempt to make every song on the album something more than it was. Having said that, this still fucking BOPS. The post-chorus is one of my favourites from the album, she sounds like such a bad-ass, overall this feels so all consumed with attitude and it just works.

---

# Everytime you see me it's like getting 10th in Reno

**frogaranaman** (11): that SYNTH

**vayyiqra** (11): Don't care what anyone says: this is the best song on this album. One of the best songs of last year, in fact. It is a ""bop"", it's an earworm. The bassline slaps, the lyrics are clever, the half-singing half-spoken parts tickle the right part of my brain. This song has everything. I'm not even a girl and unironically this feels like girlbossing (joke). I'M SO CONFIDENT I'M SO CONFIDENT

**1998tweety** (10): gay bop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Toxic masculinity?? Not from this straight-male-pophead ??

**Alumineous** (10): I dreamt about this song once, so of course I'm giving it a 10.

**bespectacIed** (10): A song that is 90% comprised of hooks, I love it. I love the silliness but the lyrics are still snark as heck. HAWT LIKE A FEEVAH MAKE U A BELIEVAH

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): ""Like the boys"" but I've never seen a man this iconic.

**CarlieScion** (10): BOPS

**conceptualromance** (10): excuse ????? my ego ?? can’t ????? go incognito ?? every ?? time ?? you see me ?? ???? it’s like winning ?? big in Reno ??

**CreepyMannequin** (10): Absolutely consumed by the knowledge that this song was inspired by Beto O’Rourke.

**Dekubaku** (10): J'adore!

**ggal2020** (10): dare I say her finest song

**hikkaru** (10): i'm not confident at all but i will still bop to this

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this was the first Rina song I fell in love with. Love the sound on this and it just makes me feel fabulous

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is so fucking gay whew. When i hear this, i turn into frankie grande i swear.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): the beat here is perfection…

**jasannn** (10): This song was made for strutting down runways.

**jaztinax** (10): this song is addicting

**ManofOranges** (10): Didn't like it at first but it did grow on me. I'm still confused as to why anyone would want to be like one of the boys though!

**pat-rickstar** (10): It’s a 10 for ""don’t fuck with me, hoe"" alone

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): it's just a flawless pop song. this song is addictive.

**racloves** (10): I kinda want to give this my eleven but I think the song I did give it to just edges it out but like this was a really tough decision

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Ended toxic masculinity and gender roles

**skargardin** (10): a perfect walking song noitstrue

**targetguest** (10): this was the first song that clicked with me on the album and what encouraged me to listen to it another 2/3/4 times to get all the others on board. big reason the album took my number 1 spot for AOTY

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): invented being confident! literally vaporized my insecurity!

**throwaway7650** (10): perfect jogging song

**Uberpigeon** (10): This was the song that got me into Rina. It popped up on youtube and I hated it... but for some reason I kept coming back until it really grew on me and became one of my favourite ever songs. The rap verses are in my head all the time.

**waluigiest** (10): I’ve been obsessed since the day it came out. Perfect glitzy kind of club music

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Dance bop ended male privilege

**zagreux** (10): girlboss gaslight gatekeep

**bulforster** (9.8): The Beto O'Rourke callout never fails to make me giggle.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): When this first released, I definitely noticed the lack of Clarence Clarity, but that didn't stop Rina from making an absolute banger

**urfavgalpal** (9.8): this is actually my most streamed song of 2020 so it should probably get a 10 but I think the thing is that while it’s one of the songs I enjoy the most I actually think there are quite a few songs on this album that are better than it so I’m curving down a little.  I think it’s great though.  Nice little retro feeling song (is this disco?  Ive seen some people say it’s kinda disco but I don’t wanna call everything with a groovy beat disco). The actual funniest thing about this song though is how she saw Beto O’Rourke running for President and was like “why the fuck does he have the confidence to do that when he isn’t qualified at all?” And thus this song was born.

**LostintheCosmicFire** (9.6): WE WANT THE PABLLO VITTAR REMIX

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Usually not a fan of these sort of reductive female-empowerment anthems, but the production is so sticky and bouncy that it's just an irresistible bop. Rina constantly just serves up pop songs like these that are so difficult to define in genre - like who is doing this sound? Really? - but are just so universally enjoyable. Also it's really cool that she could dial back her usual operatic singing and have it still be this confident and charismatic.

**liberalitea** (9.5): this song grew on me like a rash. i was meh about it at 1st but came around really quickly. i absolutely love it now

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): this is strutting music

**notarobot3675** (9.4): another bop

**cashewconstellation** (9.2): yass

**Palutzel** (9.2): so good

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): a great club track, I really hope I get to hear it once the clubs open back up

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): This song makes me feel like a bad bitch.

**afs** (9): EXTREMELY catchy house was something I didn't expect after the songs before this, and that's good.

**bbfan132** (9): :velmaserve3:

**celladonn** (9): The postchorus is too good

**CrimsonROSET** (9): we LOVE confidence!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I would love to see Rina be on the cover of an elite fashion magazine. She fucking deserves it.

**runaway3212** (9): this is good

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): It’s camp

**Turpamutteri** (9): Teach me French

**juanolsen** (8.8): the lyrics are not my favorite but this song is a certified banger

**endcreditouilles** (8.7): i'm ready to lose everything to this song in the club

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Gender norm-defying anthem

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Rina would have slayed that year at the Met Gala

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): The opening ""oooooo"" has all the glamor of a thousand pearl necklaces on the necks of a thousand rich white ladies

**jman457** (7.9): such a cute club anthem

The metaphor of equating your relationship with your heritage nation to feeling like a tourist merely stopping into a love hotel for a quick affair is honestly inspired. The idea of feeling like you aren't enough of your culture to be able to sing so intently about it and thus the repetition of ""I guess this is just another song 'bout Tokyo"" to indicate her self doubt is awesome. This was actually top 5 quite near the end, it got knocked down in the last few ballots, but still levelled out to a nice 8th which I am more than content with for a deepcut! Especially when it outplaced two other entire albums jksdjkadk

# ✨✨that moviestar glow ✨✨

**Alumineous** (11): Japan is one of the most fetishized countries in the world. Many foreigners come to Japan, treat it like a zoo, and exploit Japanese hospitality to disrespect the culture they obsess over. I think of that jackass Logan Paul, or Ariana's tattoo mistake. Anyway, I played this song over 500 times, and it still blows my mind every time. ""Your fascination's my world"" is chill-inducing. Rina's career is so young, but I am not afraid to call this her magnum opus right now. It's a masterpiece.

**juanolsen** (11): best song on the bum by far, the social commentary is really clever and i deeply relate to it

**liberalitea** (11): this song was going to get my 11 from the beginning honestly. as someone who's moved around a LOT as a child, i've never really felt i had a cultural identity- despite living in such a culturally rich country. i'm legitimately the only one in my family that can't speak my mother language properly and it hurts. it's a joke between my friends that im a white person trapped in a brown body personality wise but it's something that's always bothered me. i genuinely try to fit in, but it feels like i can't, you know? and when i do i'm made fun of. i don't really feel like i belong anywhere and sometimes it can be a huge mental burden for me. so i really do wanna thank Rina for making this song and making me feel a little less alone. the production on this is great too.

**Oberionsynth** (11): okay this is my SONG. I can't relate to the idea of Japanese culture being used as an aesthetic, but I can definitely relate to the culture side of it. It took me a long time to accept that i was gay and fall in love with the community and culture of it, just for people to start taking it to ""normalize"" it or for corporations to put a rainbow color on their logo (but only in progressive countries, so like what's the risk). ""Your fascination is my world"" is one of my favorite lyrics EVER.

**savemeaseat143** (11): Diaspora Feels

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (11): This definitely will not win but this is far and away my favorite song on the album. The lyrics, the emotion, the PRODUCTION (her and Clarence really do make magic together) are all so perfect. The background vocals and layering and melodies are all so perfectly implemented it feels like listening to an angelic pop choir sent from the heavens to bestow this song upon us.

**WeakProduct** (11): Rina at her BEST

**1998tweety** (10): masterpiece

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Oh man do I absolutely KNOW this feeling as an Asian person myself, seeing other people cherry picking parts of my culture that they like without really paying attention to the people in the country itself. Not to say it's NECESSARILY wrong, but it just feels strange to have these people pretend they're all into this particular country's culture without really going beyond the surface. What a great metaphor of using the love hotels as a metaphor for this shallow love, too. Also did I mention this is the best instrumental on the whole song? Love the driving synths that kick in in the pre-chorus and how the chorus explodes, that with Rina's usual operatic vocals and the theme make this song just so special to me. ""Your fascination's my world"" the absolute way she SNAPPED...

**bespectacIed** (10): a love song can't just be a basic love song for rina, it has to be about fetishization. Her mind.

**bookthieving** (10): this is such a specific 1.5-gen immigrant feeling, i didn't even realize i felt like this until i heard this song. how do i, as an immigrant, engage with the culture that i grew up with without participating in the fetishization of that culture as an outsider?

**camerinian** (10): God I just love that this is a perspective we're finally getting in pop and that an otherwise traditional unrequited love song can have so much heartbreaking subtext.

**CarlieScion** (10): ??

**conceptualromance** (10): this shit is in different areas

**cremeebrulee** (10): she made a song about cultural appropriation and it goes the fuck off (this would be my rina 11 tbh!)

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I really love the meaning of this song.

**fadedblue09** (10): My personal 11 on this album. I love songs that evoke images of nighttime cityscapes and the message is wholesome and cute, with a pretty mature take on love. I can see this fitting on E•MO•TION perfectly.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): I dont think I have given an album this many high scores but omg this song is so glittery and glitchy and perfect

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i don’t wanna CHECKIN! TOTHE! TOKYO LOVE HOTEL!!!!!!!

**Leixander** (10): TOKY-OOOOOOOOOOO OHHHHHHH

**lolcevan** (10): best song on the album, i know that’s right !

**musical\_pyn** (10): I initially dismissed this song, but it eventually became one of my favorites

**ReallyCreative** (10): this was actually my least favorite track on release but it has grown on me immensely with repeat listens, her power!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Rina never ceases to expand my mind with the intelligence in her metaphors. I interpreted this as a love song for an unavailable woman at first, but it is actually a tribute to her roots, and feeling protective of Japanese culture but an outsider in it at the same time.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): The first time the lyrics to this one really hit me I almost broke down at work

**shhhneak** (10): my personal fave on SAWAYAMA. I love that this song calls out appropriation and also grapples with her relationship to Japan.

**skargardin** (10): this is so darn cute

**SupremeShani** (10): While I do love XS as much as everyone else, this song ended up being my favorite off the album. A synthpop ballad isn't the most adventurous sound that Rina explores on this album, but the lyrics hit hard for me with a story exploring the concept of the fetishization and appropriation of her Japanese culture. The songwriting doesn't slow down while dealing with such a heavy topic either, and manages to be equally catchy as it is unique. I don't think it's necessarily wrong when people slap together anime scenes and shots of Japanese cities at night for their album artwork and lofi remixes, but the line ""I guess this is just another song about Tokyo"" really sticks out to me then.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i will literally never be tired of this song. such an important message and the repeated ""toKyYYYYyyYOOOooooOOooOOOooO"" is literally so beautiful???? a modern classic

**thedoctordances1940** (10): This is essentially a perfect pop song, the verses are absolutely god-tier.

**throwaway7650** (10): the outro ""tokyo""s are sooo good. the lyrics too

**Turpamutteri** (10): damn

**vayyiqra** (10): Tokyo ""[I] Love [This Song]"" Hotel

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.9): the synths are so good

**celladonn** (9.7): Not only is it a bop, but the lyrical theme of cultural identity is so good too

**wavingwolves** (9.7): i love the little details in this sooo much, every time i listen to it its like the first time <3 just like what katy said about virginity on hummingbird heartbeat or whatever

**bbfan132** (9.5): when i first heard that live version of this song from 2019 or so…. UGH, such a good song

**nick1372** (9.5): love this so much!! Incredible concept and Rina really sells it

**fairytalehigh** (9.3): when i hear the phrase ""tokyo love hotel"" my first thought is of the scene in enter the void where olly alexander is blowing a crowd of dudes in an elevator at a tokyo love hotel. anyway this song is great

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): This is NOT just another song about Tokyo, this is another INCREDIBLE song about Tokyo",Awkward_King,,3,3,2021-05-30 20:19:28

It's so haunting and yet oddly so reassuring??? Rina's telling of familial pressures especially from her experiences with her east Asian heritage are beautiful, and they pair so gorgeously with the luscious electric guitars, and Rina's vocals over the top are heavenly. Sorry for just torturing you all in beatsense with that note as well, it hasn't happened as I'm writing this but... I feel a need to apologise already. This was pretty consistently in a battle for 3rd with Do It but ultimately pulled ahead near the end, even with a 0!

# outsold the goose lady mimicking a guitar solo in her linedancing through hell song

**afs** (11): The vocals, the production, the GUITAR SOLO, and more. What an album opener.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (11): second best song of 2020, the guitar solo is the best instrumental i have ever heard, it is a perfect opening track, i could literally write a dissertation on how amazing this song is

**CrimsonROSET** (11): From the first notes, this IS the moment. I love when there’s an obvious opening track and an obvious ending track, but this is so much more than that. This is like an opening letter to Rina herself, presenting the main themes of the album, and how she deals with them sonically. This also fucking kills everytime she perforoms it. I don’t see how she can make a song better than this, but I’m looking forward to being proven wrong.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (11): Rina is a star and this song is proof

**kirby31200** (11): A perfect opener and all around a perfect song. The way she harmonizes with the guitar solo is just... chef's kiss. Also perfectly sets up the album's theme of the family we choose being more important than the family we have by blood. She's breaking the chains of her oppressive family ties and reclaiming her power with the help of the friends she loves

**lagozzino** (11): the best Ayumi Hamasaki song of the last decade

**poptartchill** (11): This is an amazing opener. I was so hooked the moment I heard it, especially when she's singing along to the guitar solo after the bridge. The lyrics are so interesting too. One of the most 11 worthy songs ever.

**seanderlust** (11): a song about intergenerational pain but making it a banger of the highest quality? YES.

**SmileAndTears** (11): When she harmonizes with the guitar? Are you KIDDING me????

**throwaway7650** (11): ""won't you break the chain with me?"" I love this song and its lyrics. such an amazing album opener and I hope it makes day 2

**TragicKingdom1** (11): perfectly crafted thesis for the album. fuck you /u/ kappyko

**Uberpigeon** (11): there is no opening track more perfect than Dynasty. Lyrically, its an amazing introduction to the rest of the themes on Sawayama and... god it just sounds so fucking good. Rinas vocals are off the rails in this one, the hard hitting guitar accompanies everything perfectly and the bridge. Oh my god the bridge. Olivia Rodrigo WISHES her bridge was this good.

**WhyDoIExistXD** (11): That bridge...

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): An epic, operatic opening with an electrifying guitar backing, it somehow evokes the ancient, oriental atmosphere Rina was aiming for, and one that she nails with her powerful, evocative singing. I also like that this is the opening track that kind of reaches back into her broken familial ties to question if she will truly carry on her origins, like what a phenomenal track to start the album with.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): Serving us vocaaaals and production. Holy shit, what a way to start off this record.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Sets the mood perfectly.

**akanewasright** (10): One of the best opening tracks of last year. Like... it’s legitimately stunning. This announces Rina’s presence, introduces its themes, and overall just *fucks* sonically.  Plus, it *immediately* shows off how much Rina has grown vocally since her last record.

**Alumineous** (10): Shit, she sung the same notes as the electric guitar! Yo, that's dope as hell! It's so amazing how Rina opened the album to something so cathartic for her. She said she will break the chain, she will be the master of her own destiny.

**anothertown** (10): ,mxn,mxcnv.xc;kvlksdjf;lsfiopvixoksndllksdlsc

**bespectacIed** (10): A song about fucking generational trauma as an opener, who is doing like Rina, seriously? Gorgeous, sprawling, stadium-worthy

**bookthieving** (10): an 11 contender! an absolute banger about the conflict between family and identity, setting up the sonic and lyrical themes of the album

**Brendon-Urine** (10): what an OPENER my gawd

**bulforster** (10): I actually kinda dislike how garbled the backing vocals are in the intro but I can't not give this a 10 after that vocal guitar solo burned away all my generational trauma.

**conceptualromance** (10): The “Maps” inspired intro, the singing along with the guitar solo, the choir...she freaked it, ladies and gentlemen

**CreepyMannequin** (10): This is the only songs that leaves me stunned every time I listen to it.

**Dekubaku** (10): An epic start befitting a legendary album

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I really love the guitars and drums and how climatic the song is and how she just opens the album with familial pain and how it’s passed down.

**EnCaine** (10): one of rina's best outros (up there with cyber stockholm syndrome)

**engifear** (10): The arrangement and production on this song is so good. There's so much going on, but it works so well

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): So grandiose and addictive!!

**Overall Average**: 7.601 **// Average Controversy:** 2.045

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.818): I think I might not be exaggerating when I say hifn is probably the closest I will get to a perfect record. When the 'weak spots' don't really feel like weak spots at all and the whole record is just one banger after the next, deliciously abrasive yet sentimental, lovely yet catchy with every shade of brightness and darkness, it makes such an album that was put together in such a short amount of time so valuable. It makes me so happy to see Charli constantly improve and make pop records so daring yet accessible, and just overall pop perfection.

**Brendon-Urine** (9.773): WOW i love this album. so so so so much. It's absolutely THE album of quarantine, and I can't think of another one that comes close to competing for that title. I know in 30 years when this whole time period is a fading memory, I will associate it with this album. If it doesn't cement Charli as the greatest pop star (and musical act) active rn idk what can

**RandomHypnotica** (9.573): Charli is one of my favourite artists, but HIFN is still far and away my favourite project by her. I truly adore this project back to front, it's always going to be a great time capsule of the start of Quarantine, but it's also just got some absolutely amazing songs on it. Perhaps I enjoy it because the themes of loneliness and self-doubt REALLY resonated with me, but there's also bangers like Pink Diamond that just make me move like nothing else. It's my favourite project in this rate, and I REALLY hope it doesn't get done dirty (but I know it will...)

**kirby31200** (9.545): The best quarantine album that actually is about the quarantine. It's incredible she followed up the masterpiece that is Charli with another masterpiece.

**plastichaxan** (9.445): this album is incredible and not even one of charli’s best… her power… but honestly, this is the best quarantine album since it’s concept and such an event as an angel i will never forget

**steelstepladder** (9.373): Probably the album I am going to think about the most when reflecting on my quarantine listening

**camerinian** (9.318): yeah it's ok

**conceptualromance** (9.182): this album was exactly what I needed last May

**Palutzel** (9.145): call me dramatic, but this is a modern masterpiece

**hakkerj** (9.064): Charli XCX REALLY set the precedent for quarantine albums

**iniekcja\_** (9.045): I always wonder if this specific collection of music would be received so well if it wasn't for the global lockdown, I would say sonically it's one of her weaker projects since the Vroom Vroom rebrand but the circumstances make it feel much better

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.009): personally, not my fav of her work, but it is close

**pig-serpent** (9.000): I didn't love this immediately, but over time I found this to be exactly the quarantine album I needed and it grew into my aoty. Every song on here can be partied too or vibed too depending on how loud you feel like listening to it. A comfort album to sooth my wildly changing states of mind.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.909): Tbh I don’t like the cover. She could’ve worn black, white on white is pretty bland.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.773): Listening to this album a year later after it was made was quite an experience and it felt different from when I first heard it. This is definitely an album I am going to look back on as a classic for different reasons. It's going to age a bit due to the fact this was a ""quarantine "" album but I think anyone who was able to hear this album when it came out is going to have some kind of attachment to it due to the memories they have during quarantine.

**nick1372** (8.409): Charli has a lot of good songs in her discography, but she’s always lacked the focus to create a cohesive album. The lockdown gave her that opportunity and this is by far my favorite album of hers! It really made me expect a flood of incredible lockdown music from all my favorite artists and that was absolutely not the case, but I am thankful for this album and I’m glad I had it to help me cope with such a terrible year.

**nooodisaster** (8.318): this album is the dark horse of this rate it's just sooo quality and will be out at #5.

**anothertown** (8.273): this album is fine but extremely boring. It’s emblematic of the non-depressed people who were very upset by quarantine for 3 months

**wasian-invasion** (8.273): Parts of this don't connect as well as they did a year ago, but I still appreciate it for being a perfect snapshot of 2020 angst. Even though it's got some of her top songs, I haven't come back to it as much as Charli or Pop 2

**EnCaine** (8.273): not nearly my favorite thing charli has done but still good af, i've loved her since I Love It and i've only been rewarded

**jman457** (8.191): its low key, minimalist production compared to Charli’s other bombastic production makes it a fav of mine.

**akanewasright** (8.155): this is an album that very much reflects the circumstances under which it was created. It’s messy, heartfelt, and restless, and I love that for it.

**ktajlili** (8.091): I haven't listened to this album in full since the start of the pandemic, and wow does it feel like a lightning in the bottle. It was hard for me to process my emotions at the time. It was such a scary, awful, and miserable time that I don't plan to return to this anytime soon. But damn, does Charli deliver.

**pat-rickstar** (8.091): Charli is one of my absolute favourite artists and I love a lot of songs here but it's just not my favourite album of hers. With some of the songs it's a little too obvious that they were made in a short time period

**thedoctordances1940** (8.091): While it's not her best work, I definitely still prefer Charli and Pop 2, she keeps up the consistency she's shown over the last few years and for just how quickly it was made, it is really impressive.

**welcome2thejam** (7.909): I've loved a handful of Charli's tracks, but I've never really clicked with any of her full albums til this one. And while I'm curious to see how it holds up as quarantine eases up around me, the fact that it's only gotten better in my re-listens this week bodes well.

**buddhacharm** (7.864): While I don't think it's as versatile or as robust as Charli/Pop 2, I still think it's an essential listen because it serves as an incredible and disorienting encapsulation of the heavy and mind-numbing nature of 2020. It really does capture the zeitgeist unlike any album I've heard in recent memory, and I think it certainly offers really valuable, introspective, and morose reflections on the state of the world during the VERY specific window of time that it took to craft this record. Thankfully, the album is just as special and volatile as the conditions that informed its make, though I'd be lying if I said that I've returned to it as much as I have her self-titled; maybe that's because HIFN is so inextricable from the triggering imagery that surrounded the first lockdown ??

**bigbigbee** (7.818): I liked this album, then it grew off me, then I started to love it again recently. And the songs that I liked at first are not the songs that I like now. So in the end, I’ve felt every kind of way about this album and I can understand both the people who call it incredible and the people who call it crap. Ultimately, when this album is on, I love the way the songs make me feel – wistful, then inspired; powerful, then sweet.

**waluigiest** (7.818): I was lucky enough to be in the first Zoom meeting about this album. It’s a serve and it’s a legendary piece of quarantine art, but it loses me around the middle tracks

**Roxieloxie** (7.773): im feeling sad

**Qustomar** (7.773): This album is good, I generally like pretty much anything Charli puts out lol. The whole pandemic context gives it a very interesting atmosphere, and seeing everything be created in real-time from the songs to the fan chosen artworks was really cool and memorable. Just what I would love is for this album to be converted into a 1-2 hour, continuous night club DJ set you know? I wanna hear the production of every song get intertwined, every stem of the instrumentals slowly get added and taken away, hear the chaos build up and then go down. I think that would help a few of the more 'underdeveloped' sounding songs get polished, and then some of the other songs could become really really epic and allow the listener to fully relish in the production (especially the last 3 tracks omg).

**vayyiqra** (7.727): I finally understand ... the hype over this album! When it came out I wasn't that into it and found it to be not too memorable. Now I can happily say it is a grower and I enjoy it quite a bit. I like Charli a lot and always have (I first saw her live in 2014) so it's been neat to see her change over time and also write more personal lyrics on this record. The glitchy, distorted sound on some tracks does take some getting used to but after that, it's pretty enjoyable (and relatable).

**fadedblue09** (7.682): Now how did this get such a high average for me? In all seriousness, I’m surprised how much I liked this, considering I normally do not vibe with Charli’s music. I was ready to dismiss this as a bunch of Pop 2/Charli rejects, but it does feel like an album of its own. I love the lyrical themes and the lack of features, it definitely felt like a product of her isolation and there’s an intimate feel here that I haven’t felt from her since True Romance. Her abrasive production is still not for me, but at least I understand her artistry a bit more now.

**Roxieloxie** (9.983): i mean i guess its okay :/

**conceptualromance** (9.625): this album is just so impressive to me (??). They’re incredibly talented

**bespectacIed** (9.583): Flawlessly done pop, r&b, and soul tracks from the two most talented and likeable newbies in the industry. I am banking in on Chloe x Halle supremacy.

**AHSWeeknd** (9.417): One of the best albums of all time.

**wavingwolves** (9.333): i always associate this album with grocery shopping because that was my go to grocery shopping album for a few months but this is a compliment tbh. this is incredibly well produced and i love the textures the songs have, it's all velvet smooth and silky.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.317): one of my favorite albums from last year, I’m so excited to see what they do next. They are so talented and deserve to be even bigger.

**akanewasright** (9.292): Genuinely, how do you make an album this good so early into your careers?

**ElizabethDDoS** (9.250): I regret sleeping on this album for several months after it came out.

**ReallyCreative** (9.167): I don't have the words to express how much I love this fucking album

**musical\_pyn** (9.083): I immediately fell in love with this album, and my love has only grown since to the point where this is probably my favorite album of 2020

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8.975): My most listened to artist of 2020 behind like Beyoncé and my most listened to artist of 2019. Very excited.

**geraldinewww** (8.942): i think i'd only listened to this once (?) before this rate and MY MISTAKES.......!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY GOD!!!!!!!!!

**Dekubaku** (8.942): A seriously amazing album I discovered through this sub and this rate. It has the voice, the lyrics, the production!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.917): I haven't heard of any music from Chloe x Halle until I saw people praising this album when it came out. It's so easy to see why. It's so impressive that this album was worked with so many producers but Chloe and Halle found a way to make this album sonically consistent. Even with one weak song in this perfect album, every song didn't feel like a filler at all. On top of it, their vocals are so heavenly (which you will see a lot in my comments about some of the tracks lol) and their songwriting is top-notch. I can't wait for what Chloe x Halle has up in their sleeves next. And oh, thank you Beyonce for trusting Chloe and Halle so much to deliver a perfect album.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.908): The album I was least familiar with going into the rate. I knew of and loved the two big singles, but the rest of the tracklist impressed me with how well-written it was, the great production, and Chloe and Halle's sublime vocals.

**pat-rickstar** (8.833): My #2 album of 2020, they weren't even on my radar until this came out and I fell in love as soon as I checked it out.

**anothertown** (8.833): slept on masterpiece

**waluigiest** (8.833): it didn’t instantly click for me but in February 2021 wow it hit

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (8.750): love the whole vibe of this album

**kirby31200** (8.708): I had never heard of these two before 2020 and boy have they made a fantastic first impression on me.

**plastichaxan** (8.617): this album is so full of serves, i’m ashamed to admit how long it took me to find this such a great album but i learned my lesson

**NotWith10000Men** (8.583): why the hell haven't I had this album on constant repeat since I first heard it?? I will be rectifying that immediately

**jayjaysortagay** (8.583): this is iconic

**bookthieving** (8.542): the only artist in this rate to not get below a 6 from me. they cannot make a bad song

**jsonphile** (8.542): this was my first time listening to this album, but wow it’s really solid. Chloe and Halle are both fantastic singers, and these are some incredibly well written tracks. If there’s any justice in the world, these girls are gonna be one of the biggest acts of the 2020s

**fadedblue09** (8.542): They mopped the competition with ease! In all seriousness, I’m so glad to discover them. I’m normally skeptical of PH-core albums like these, but this just feels different from the rest in many ways. Despite the high caliber production, the girls and their soulful vocals are the highlight of every song. Not to mention they easily convey a lot of mature subject matter in their lyrics, I find it hard to believe they’re the youngest among these artists. Most popheads-core albums feel very of-the-moment, but I can see myself revisiting this a lot in the future.

**engifear** (8.500): I swear they could sing about literally anything and it would sound absolutely beautiful (as long as there are no men also singing)

**skargardin** (8.500): This is so solid and I can't wait to hear what they do after this! Hopefully it isn't too robbed this rate.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.458): perfection from start to finish apart from that one song...

**Qustomar** (8.417): Such a gorgeous album, everything about it is lush and immaculate, yet very youthful at the same time. Chloe x Halle made something very special here.

**EnCaine** (8.342): i didn't listen to anything from this record until almost 2021 and i am a clown for that. CxH are the future

**moooo566** (8.333): This album is the discovery of the month for me, I didn't really get into Do It when it was on the charts and kind of wrote the whole thing off as not for me, but it turns out they're good!

**iniekcja\_** (8.292): I love the idea behind this album and the way it flows through all the songs with some great storytelling, after many listens there are still some tracks that don't stick for me but it's compensated by amazing vocals, songwriting and production on others

**liberalitea** (8.208): Chloe x Halle are such a talented duo and balance eachother perfectly. They write, produce, dance, sing and perform amazingly well. This is an INCREDIBLE project and I'm so excited to hear more from them.

**notarobot3675** (8.183): like thousands of others have said, this album is such a phenomenal debut! theres not one skip on this album, and it really is just a perfect showcase for these girls stellar vocals. while i know this album got a lot of hype online, it really should have made them megastars.

**shhhneak** (8.183): My first time playing through this whole album so I expect it to grow even more on me. By far the best lyricists in this rate that really elevates their unclockable vocals.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.167): An absolute surprise for me last year! I freaking adore this album! I love how incredibly cohesive it is while still maintaining a really diverse and interesting sound across all twelve songs. It’s also so easy to hear how much love and effort was put into this album by Chloe and Halle, and it’s hard not to feel that infectious energy listening to it.

**mudkip1** (8.167): she's perfect, she's beautiful, she looks like Linda Evangelista, she's a model

**Brendon-Urine** (8.042): So glad this rate made me sit down and really listen to this. I kinda wrote it off on release but this album is beautiful all the way through with just a few meh tracks in the middle. Production is insanse (shoutout Queen B)

In my view, it reflects the influx of new ARMY (which is awesome!) and Reddit's special appreciation for for the rapline and Suga (much deserved), which may perhaps disadvantage older songs and other members a tiny bit.

And there are some individual songs for which I seek justice.

But when I look at this list as a whole, it makes sense to me and I think we chose well.

For those wondering why ON ft. Sia got dumped on so badly, from my perspective (which of course my not be accurate), it sounds like she didn't even try to add anything unique to the song. And we ARMY seem to be sensitive about people possibly getting an advantage from BTS's fame without making an effort to reciprocate.

2. It will do nothing for NJPW they will still have as big of a name as they do now in the US because most of the AEW audience already know what NJPW is and the type of storytelling NJPW does won't work for a big US audience

For NJPW to get back the Elite would be a major boost let's not beat around the bush about it, a another Okada/Omega or Omega/Ibushi match would be big business. I never got the feeling it was the talent from NJPW or Gedo that didn't want to work with AEW but the bosses behind the scenes.

I also hope seen as they are owned by the same company that AEW will be able to work with Stardom and bring over the likes of Mayu Iwatani and a few others for their women's division. I hope that happens as excited as I am if this opens the door to NEw Japan team I'm more excited if this opens doors now to Stardom working with AEW.

God I did *not* expect this song to be as hated as it was haha, I always enjoyed this as a weird blend between 2000s electropop and r&b somehow with a kind of unsettling melodic twist? Not quite sure exactly how to put it, but it works for me. It's not incredible, but I think it works. Many of you however, evidently, did not LMAO.

# We irritating

**1998tweety** (10): i love britney

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): should have been in the main rate 3 AND THAT LAST MINUTE,I'M A SLUT FOR MULTIPLE VOICES AND THAT DISTORTION WHAT

**pheromenos** (10): rina never misses honestly

**plastichaxan** (10): these bonus tracks being better than love me 4 me (except for lucid)

**KennyEarthman** (9): the production went ham on this one... maybe a little too ham

**notarobot3675** (9): this is another song that really hypes me up

**throwaway7650** (9): the best new/original song on the deluxe :noitstrue:

**urfavgalpal** (8.6): I think this is my favorite of the bonus tracks?  Feels the most at home on the album

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): This is low-key giving me Jenny from the Block teas.

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Yes I’m giving this a higher score than STFU or Snakeskin, no I would not replace either of those with this

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): Reminds me of some of her EP tracks, I like it a lot

**afs** (8): Lots of MJ in the verses there. And it's so aggressive wow.

**amiriteor** (8): amigas...cheetahs...friends for life. only an 8 bc i HATE the beginning and the end and the title

**bigbigbee** (8): I like this a lot. I think it’s more successful at the 00s Max Martin sound than Love Me 4 Me is.

**musical\_pyn** (8): I was not expecting this to be as good as it is! Could've been on the main album

**Oberionsynth** (8): ugh I love her 2000s vibes music, esp when it's about being gay

**poptartchill** (8): LOVE the end! Overall sounds more like RINA than SAWAYAMA

**SupremeShani** (8): we love a 2000s pop music revival, unfortunately xs does this sound much better, but we still out here

**fairytalehigh** (7.8): kinda reminds me alunageorge ?? also kinda reminds me of alunageorge covering ""this is how we do it"" ??

**jasannn** (7.5): I get why it's a bonus track but it still fits the nu-metal pop sound she is going for and the track gets better as it progresses, especially with that key change.

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): The only good Rina bonus track. Justice for her Love It If We Made It and Dance In The Dark covers

**iniekcja\_** (7): the message is good!! (the mix is bad)

**runaway3212** (7): I get why it was cut, but it's fun

**jman457** (6.8): like the techno/rock inspo but not really anything that justifies being on the album.

**bbfan132** (6.5): not on the album for a reason, although it’s not bad

**EnCaine** (6.5): i like parts of this

# This song irritating

**AHSWeeknd** (6): This sounds so unfinished

**frogaranaman** (6): if rating these deluxe / bonus tracks have told me anything it’s that these tracks usually stay as ‘bonuses’ for a reason

**vayyiqra** (6): Well, this is a song that exists. I would like it more if the chorus weren't so unwritten. Also, the bridge is weak. (Fully aware of the irony I just gave ""Lucid"" a 10 when it has a fucking instrumental drop as the chorus.)

**waluigiest** (6): she knew which songs to cut from the standard album

**Alumineous** (5): Heavy 90s/2000s vibes. I'm gonna call it a meh. Would never play it again. It's just a little too on the nose, which makes it sorta tacky and uninspired.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Glad this wasn’t on the actual album

**Vultuxe** (5): I guess I'm tired but I keep replaying it and then forgetting it and not knowing what to score so it's a 5

**wavingwolves** (4.9): i'm glad this isn't actually on the album tbh

**nick1372** (4.5): “we out here” is already dated rina and you’re not helping it by repeating it over and over again and surrounding it by vague corny lyrics

**Brendon-Urine** (4): this is... uhhhhh interesting i guess?

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (4): I like the vocal layering on this but this song really feels like a half baked Britney/Xtina loose, not like a Rina song

**pig-serpent** (4): I have so many conflicting thoughts on this song and no matter how many times I listen to it I still can't pinpoint any of my feelings for it. I think that overall I'm not a fan of more noisy aspects of the song and I don't think the parts of the song I enjoy are good enough to counter the parts I don't.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Well! This song certainly sounds like a statement! Not sure of what though!

**seanderlust** (3): there's just...a lot going on here

**Tedyonce** (3): it didn’t make the album for a reason

**cashewconstellation** (2): no

**akanewasright** (1): this just sounds ugly I’m sorry. It makes me feel sick, and I think that’s a result of mixing but it’s just... not pleasant for me

**fadedblue09** (1): Excruciating

**IIIHenryIII** (1): Is this a demo or something? What's wrong with the audio quality? I could not finish it.

# this is a cheetah girls song

**hakkerj** (8.4): This sounds like a Cheetah Girls song omg!!! I like it!

**Roxieloxie** (8): this is a cheetah girls song

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): what in the cheetah girls hell. stop making dated pop hits when we know you can be better at references than this, Rina.

# ur gay

**moooo566** (11): I feel like this would work really well as a duet, maybe with a dude and a piano? Would be a 12 if you did that.

**pheromenos** (11): extra credit for introducing me to rina. also do i get anything if my 11 goes out first in a rate?

**zagreux** (11): as a gay person in a homophobic place this song means so much to me. also the npr tiny desk version is superior thank you very much.

**1998tweety** (10): yall dragged this and for what, its cute

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): This is probably where most people will deck points off from SAWAYAMA but, there's something so pure about this song that is hard to hate at all. I love this message about 'choosing' your family and your home, your own safe space. It's definitely the song most people will be waving their hands Graduation (Friends Forever) style, fingers perching lit candles, some having tears streaming down their face... you get the idea. Love the simplicity overall of the production and melody, appropriately cheesy guitars and all - they just work together really well.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): Should I ever get married, I will pick this as my wedding song just to spite y’all haters.

**akanewasright** (10): King ily but also fuck you

**Alumineous** (10): I don't know how I haven't cried to this song yet. As a kid, I grew up watching all those coming out videos on YouTube. I was... an idiot to believe my Asian parents could accept me for who I was. I used to spend so much time at the LGBTQ+ centre downtown because it was the only place I felt safe. Look, I'm over feeling resentful or envious of other queer people who didn't have to face what I faced. If you do have parents who truly love you, treasure that love forever. I don't think I'll be talking to my parents any time soon.

**amiriteor** (10): this song.......YEAH

**bespectacIed** (10): You have to be cop to hate on this, like come on. It's a bit sappy but that's the fucking point, the queer experience is a melodramatic affair. If a youngster who has ever felt isolated in life hears this and it compels them to be find/create their chosen families, more power to them. Love this to bits, and the Tiny Desk version is even better.

**brenda\_official** (10): best song of all time if this comes last i will be very upset

**Brendon-Urine** (10): tears. real tears.

**celladonn** (10): This will be a victim of balladphobia but sometimes cheesy things are good!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): IM NOT CRYING YOURE CRYING !!!!!!!!

**izeaklapaucius** (10): fuck you and your balladphobia popheads

**musical\_pyn** (10): yes it's a little cheesy, but god this song touches on a subject that is so, so close to me and so many others

**nick1372** (10): This song is so incredible it’s almost difficult to believe it’s real? Like you listen to it and you can’t fathom how it hasn’t existed for your entire life? It’s just a truly transcendent experience.

**nooodisaster** (10): I feel hugged.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): makes me cry every time

**Roxieloxie** (10): i mean she said she was gonna write a song called chosen family so idk what i was expecting. this is a 5 but its gonna go out first and i wanna make king mad so ill give it a 10

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I have a complicated relationship with the term “chosen family” because my own family is so shit that family doesn’t seem like something that I would ever want to choose, and I am fine with just calling my friends my friends. But while this song is on my opinion changes and I just get in this weirdly bittersweet emotional state? Anyways, I feel like Glee would totally have done a bad cover of this and I have never even seen Glee

**static\_int\_husp** (10): popheads balladphobia is gonna tank this undeservedly

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): do i stream this one a lot? no. will i ever listen to the elton john version? probably not! but it's fucking cute and overly hated!!! maybe it's not the ~GAY RIGHTS!!~ anthem she heralds it as but it's a still a touching little song that i like a lot.

**TiltControls** (10): overhated bop! can't wait to get down on the dancefloor to this song once things open up

**wasian-invasion** (10): such beautiful songwriting and rina's vocalsss <3 also i don’t think ive ever heard surname used in a song before lol

**wavingwolves** (10): when this goes out bottom 5 because gay people are literally the worst!!! still, i appreciate this a lot as someone who was (and will probably never be) accepted and supported by their own family. i find the melody to be really nice and i like her voice in this a lot. also, fuck you /u/Awkward_King

**plastichaxan** (9.5): say what you want about this and the lyrics but they hit really close to me idc

**bigbigbee** (9): I get why this song is hated on so much; the lyrics are definitely a bit trite (esp. the bridge), but I don’t know. It just works for me. Musically speaking, I really love the melody and the underlying instrumental; it reminds me a little of Owl City (have I mentioned that I love Owl City?).

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This has grown on me a lot since it was released. It works well on the album and stands out well. That bridge into the final chorus is gorgeous.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): y’all are about to do this so dirty, and for what?

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Oh gosh, I hate that I am might have to witness this song going out on Day 1. This is such a beautiful song that heals me every time I hear this song. Sorry to add something about Taylor here but this is something she should have written about her appreciation for the LGBTQ+ community instead of You Need to Calm Down.

**jsonphile** (9): is this song cheesy as hell? Yes. Do I love it anyway? Yes.

**juanolsen** (9): i unpopular opinion but this song is great and the message is absolutely beautiful

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): This may have been a 10 for me before I heard the Elton John version.......and now that I know what's possible......this gets a 9

**NotWith10000Men** (9): this song is precious and I absolutely love the elton collab

**ReallyCreative** (9): the Elton John version did redeem this track a few points for me, the message is just too good to really subtract points from, queer friendships are so precious and special in a way that can be so hard to articulate, but this song makes a vary valiant attempt

**skargardin** (9): fuck the haters, this is lovely

**thedoctordances1940** (9): I know not everybody's too keen on this song but I find it absolutely gorgeous and the Elton John remix even manages to improve it.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this has several layers of camp

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): this song grew on me a lot. it's heavy-handed, sure, but it's deeply heartfelt. and the elton remix has such a glorious gay passing of the torch energy. i have to stan

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.4): I love how warm and sincere this is. Pretty tame for a Danny L Harle collab but not every song needs to be an experimental masterpiece, and I definitely underrated the production before, the electronic touches are giving me Frou Frou.

**afs** (8): A ballad, which isn't what I'm particularly into. Would have given a 7, but that note and the part after convinced me otherwise.

**anothertown** (8): people are so weird and homophobic about this song like we get it you hate songs about gay people loving and supporting each other

**conceptualromance** (8): I don’t get the hate for this song. It’s sweet!! Sometimes being corny is good!

**ggal2020** (8): this song is good you guys are just mean

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I’ve heard people say this is too cheesy but I literally stan Meghan Trainor so like… I’m not above that

**ImADudeDuh** (8): an INNOCENT song

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): Fully resisting the urge to post that RuPaul quote from Season 5, I really do love this song. I’m not usually one for a schmaltzy ballad moment but god it’s so beautiful.

**kappyko** (8): this does not make me recoil the way the carly lyric in bad friend does

**liberalitea** (8): yeah this song is kind of corny and the balladphobia is gonna make this an early out, but it's a good song imo. i love the message and her vocals are amazing as always.

**pat-rickstar** (8): Something something overhated

**salivantsonority** (8): Sonically not my fav but I love the message. And her vocals are gorg. A little too waving flashlight on phone for me.",Awkward_King,,8,8,2021-05-28 19:54:32

The best way to describe this song is definitely transcendant, it really feels like you are being lifted into another plain when Charli is singing with those heavily effected vocals in the first verse. Though the breakdown is... not my favourite, I really love the parts of this that I love ajsdkajks

---

# Raven-Symoné

**LuisEnRod** (11): I transcended the first time I listened to this song and that’s that on that. If she doesn’t close out her shows in the future with this song idk what I’ll do.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): A wonderful send-off to a basically almost perfect album, the outro reminds me a lot of 2099 in how apocalyptic it is but with such a manic energy as well.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It sounds like she sampled a fire alarm at the end

**bbfan132** (10): :poohascend:

**Brendon-Urine** (10): and of course a perfect album ends with a perfect closer.

**camerinian** (10): Holy fuck this is just the perfect way to close the album. The intimacy and the euphoria all wrapped into one spellbinding package. All I want is to be back in a sweaty gig with a DJ dropping that second half somewhere for me to lose my fucking mind. Is that too much to ask

**eeveefan01** (10): the outro is an out of body experience

**engifear** (10): This was an 11 contender for me. I want to dance to this song with other people so bad.

**fairytalehigh** (10): one of the main things that got me through 2020 was the fantasy of losing my mind to the outro of this song live. still excitedly awaiting that day

**iniekcja\_** (10): the whole pussy was inserted into the outro

**KennyEarthman** (10): that drop ascended me to another plane of existence

**pat-rickstar** (10): B.A.N.G.E.R.

**pig-serpent** (10): This is a great song, but what if it was 10 minutes long and had a video of Charli going swimming. Haha, jk. Unless...

**plastichaxan** (10): i got pictures in my mind too!!

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): CHAOS CHAOS CHAOS CHAOS

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): rave intensifies

**seanderlust** (10): i love this album bc my alexa timer has been going off for like five minutes and I just thought it was part of the songs

**skargardin** (10): the album is uneven but it does end off SO strong, what a banger

**steelstepladder** (10): Best closer of the four albums?

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Definitely one of Charli's all time best tracks, the gorgeous opening verses set up the ridiculously banger-tastic rave section so well, it's quite literally been proven impossible to not bop your head at the end of the song.

**vagenda** (10): when she said [ALARM BLARING NOISES] i really felt that

**zagreux** (10): the outro lives in my head rent-free

**juanolsen** (9.5): really great way to finish this album, it ties everything together nicely and it's classic charli

**liberalitea** (9.5): this is a super fun song

**nick1372** (9.5): maybe best production on the album? The version at appleville really made me appreciate this track more

**Palutzel** (9.5): what a closer, what an album

**CrimsonROSET** (9): c’mon oracle of charli

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is a nice full circle moment on the album, it uses some of the same techniques as the other songs on the album (especially similar to “Forever”) but it has comparatively tamer production as if she’s finally achieved clarity after all the turmoil of everything that’s come before. The dance breakdown at the end is nice too

**ktajlili** (9): I love the outro

**mudkip1** (9): wait i'm hearing sumn

**nooodisaster** (9): A classic last song, this is just beautiful from start to finish. The slow ethereal start building to the chaotic instrumental descent to pure electronica

**Qustomar** (9): The combo of Anthems and Visions ending the album kinds reminds me of how Homogenic ends with Pluto/All is Full of Love, thoughts?

**runaway3212** (9): a great closer

**vayyiqra** (9): A banger! I love that outro. It almost feels like being at a live show again.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Absolute bunker buster of a back half. This and Anthems together is such a strong one-two punch to close the album on.

**geraldinewww** (8.5): solely for the breakdown at the end

**Vultuxe** (8.5): I like visions, it steps away from hyperpop and dangerously close to eurobeat, which is... nice. The build up is great. Somehow this 3:49s song feels like 5 minutes or more.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): what an impressive album closer

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): This isn't a bad song, but in the context of the rest of the album, it definitely feels underwhelming. Once again though, the outro is jaw-droppingly good. This album has consistently good outros

**amiriteor** (8.3): get me into a club

**afs** (8): the first minute and a half was the second most unexpected part of the album, but Charli couldn't contain herself and decided to shake things up just a little bit.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This is a banger, but a lot of the first half is basically recycled Unlock It...

**hakkerj** (8): COULD the club even handle us...?

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): So I mean you have to play this right after Unlock it (lock it) in a club space right? Also the outro goes so fucking hard! Charlotte did not have to bless us like this

**lagozzino** (8): hello mid-00s futurepop. Charli getting ready to play Wave Gotik Treffen with this one.

**pros-and-connors** (8): would have been higher but the last minute is there

**throwaway7650** (8): really good album closer, almost reminds me of KARA - step

**Uberpigeon** (8): I forgot this one existed but it kind of slaps

**jman457** (7.8): Im unsure where to put my feelings for it but its certainly a way to end an album

**1998tweety** (7.5): ascend, this was a 10 until we got to the end

**akanewasright** (7.5): This song is kind of a mess? But also I think it’s kind of great?

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.5): I like the bouncy sounds.

**jasannn** (7.5): It's odd that there are two EDM-esque closers in this rate but this is the superior one.

**Leixander** (7.5): the outro is godly [9999]

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): this song gets a lot of hate but I genuinely would prefer if more of the album sounded like this?

**Turpamutteri** (7.5): the ending was kinda annoying but other than that I enjoyed this

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): The alarm ending is a fun way to end an album like this, but doesn't make me want to re-listen or add it to any playlists

**musical\_pyn** (7): it's a fine closer, I wish there was more to the song though

**notarobot3675** (7): great album closer

**NotWith10000Men** (7): this is a really nice closer. I like the drum that goes through the end.

**Oberionsynth** (7): why did i think this song started with charli saying ""bitches in that ass"" with her whole chest

**poptartchill** (7): sounds like a song that would play in the club that I'd jam to but it's while I go to get another drink

**SupremeShani** (7): Going out with a rave is the most Charli thing she could have done, and I appreciate it.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): this is a strong closer

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): A good song but very sonically similar to Anthems. I love a closing track that feels “final,” though, which this one absolutely does

**NecroDolphinn** (6.8): I absolutely hate the moment right after the first chorus because I want the build to start and then it just doesn’t and ugh, but the rest of the song is good",Awkward_King,,7,7,2021-05-28 21:28:28

Ah yes, my obligatory bad take of the rate. I was very tempted to give this my 11 over XS, anthems or ROYL, which were all very strong options for me, as this is far and away my favourite Carly song in the rate and honestly one of my favourite songs in the rate overall. I don't know what it is, because I wouldn't exactly but faux-tropical music on a list of genres that I seek out, but I think the melodies of it are just really pretty to me and it feels really transportive! The ""love on the beach and the tide is high"" is so on the nose but so effective, the whole song is very literal in its presentation, its a beachy song with extremely obvious tides and beach sounds in the background, but idk, it just works for me.

---

# Grimes stans

**IIIHenryIII** (11): Ok, I gotta be honest, TLIC is my favorite, but this is my second favorite for sure. I'm just giving it my 11 to give it the appreciation it deserves. I mean, did you really listen to this track if you hated it? Listening to this makes me feel like I'm levitating on a fluffy cloud that is actually a boat drifting away in the ocean near the coast of California, but I'm actually a straight merman swimming with Ariel and exploring the vastness of unknown, magical waters. Help me, I'm drowning in this sound! Perfect album closer!

**Vromega** (11): instantly fell in love with this song when I first heard this album. I still remember this exact moment I closed this album for the first time, during quarantine. This song quickly became one of my fave of 2020. The dropplets are so pleasing. I don't think I still have this strange feeling of ""ascending"" ""flying"" while listening to this song now. I also realize now this is far from being her best in terms of vocals but it still deserves my 11 for everything this song brought me last year <3

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This’ll probably be one of the first songs out but it’s an exotica inspired gem. Love it.

**akanewasright** (10): This isn’t even my type of music but it’s just... so nice....

**conceptualromance** (10): cute

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m from California… can’t say I relate. But I love how dreamy this is, it’s the perfect closer to the album because it makes you feel like you’re just drifting away…

**kappyko** (10): vacation bible school bop

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (10): Best song of the Dedicated era. Not a typical Carly bop, but has me feeling like I'm sitting on the beach relaxing when I've actually been in my garden-level apartment, having not seen the sun for 13 months

**ManofOranges** (10): I don't believe her!

**mudkip1** (10): an amazing bop idgaf what anyone else says

**poptartchill** (10): it has Christmas vibes for some reason but I love it

**waluigiest** (10): obligated to give it a 10 because of how I deeply relate to every lyric oops

**welcometoNY** (10): I already know some of y'all are going to do this song dirty, and if that applies to you, yes you are a bad person and you should feel bad

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.9): so overhated

**Roxieloxie** (9.6): Me when LA Hallucinations comes on.

**TiltControls** (9.5): groovy

**savemeaseat143** (9.4): I like sound effects

**fenellabeach** (9.1): I don't hate how long this song is

**hunnybee12** (9): I listen to After School by Weeekly on repeat a lot and to find it I usually search “after” in my liked songs, and so then this song plays immediately after everytime. after it playing dozens of times I started to actually like it even though I forgot it existed before that. I guess that’s my review for side b, it’s enjoyable when it comes on but it will never be After School by Weeekly

**juanolsen** (9): nice surprise at the end of the album

**ktajlili** (9): I think this was left off the original album because it's not a dancy but it 100% deserves to be there.

**musical\_pyn** (9): this has grown on me so much, I love the hook and production

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): this song is flawed for sure and I won't be mad if it makes an early exit but I do love it, it's so calming and fun

**vagenda** (8.6): A great addition to the “Canadian singers realizing the golden state isn’t as terrible as they originally thought” canon, right next to Allie X’s Not So Bad in LA

**bbfan132** (8.5): relaxing outro, i like the aquatic sound of the production

**bigbigbee** (8.5): east coast beast coast but this song is cute and fun

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): ties with ""warm blood"" for carly's most 420-friendly bop

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): the most interesting song on the album by a LANDSLIDE.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.3): This is basically L.A. Hallucinations' older, more mature sister. What a great song to close this album.

**Dekubaku** (8.1): A sweet airy ending befitting the mood of the album.

**EnCaine** (8): is this california's folklore era

**engifear** (8): This is such a good summery song

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): Carly said cali was the mission ??

**jasannn** (8): Cheesy but atmospheric.

**just\_thonking** (8): I feel like this will be a controversial one... In my opinion it does it exactly what it sets out to do and it's a fun, relaxing listen

**seanderlust** (8): me deciding that despite her marrying elon, grimes' discog is still pretty good

**vayyiqra** (8): cute

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I actually really like this… It’s strange and different, but in a sea (heh) of 6s and 7s this is a welcome surprise!

**Vultuxe** (8): People are going to love or hate this one, but I think it's nice. Not flawless but despite it's length I enjoy letting it play all the way through.

**wasian-invasion** (8): dancing day-drunk by the pool at a cheap palm springs motel vibes

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8): Tropical legend

**zagreux** (8): Now I Don't Hate Now I Don't Hate California After All After All

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): from LA Hallucinations to Now I Don’t Hate California After All…. this is character development

**cashewconstellation** (7.8): is it a bop? no. but it's pretty enjoyable, even if you have to be in the right mood for it. wait actually i reached the third minute mark and it might actually be a bop

**jman457** (7.6): It really feels like a surreal dream between utopia and dystopia

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): she’s cute [2]

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Good for you

**throwaway7650** (7.5): I love spongebob music (no but it seriously reminds me of bikini bottom/the beach)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.3): A cute relaxing summer bop

**shhhneak** (7.1): My brain has rotted in the last year so this kind of sounds like a Blessed Madonna song now…

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): A shimmery summery end to a pretty okay record, it's a cool track but I

**afs** (7): I was seriously worried she was going to try hip-hop during the intro, but thankfully she was actually going for a beachy vibe.

**amiriteor** (7): i like madonna

**thegraygh0st** (7): this song gets too much hate its cute! like if spongebob and sandy were in la la land

**wavingwolves** (6.9): this is cute as hell and i have a soft spot for songs mentioning ocean/waves/sea/water soooo

**SupremeShani** (7): I was a bit disappointed in the song after such a fascinating title, but it's still not bad at all. I love those sparkling synths and the underwater feeling here, just wish the lyrics hit harder.",Awkward_King,,6,6,2021-05-28 19:36:22

Tina Taught Me not to fuck with interludes I'm sorry

# Me before this rate started

**Alumineous** (10): Interlude? Interlude.

**conceptualromance** (10): so true besties ??

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): jesus this song is beautiful from top to bottom. i don't think i had listened to it as much before doing this rate, and it's just so lovely. the harmonies, the piano, the lyrics. it embodies anxiety and those feelings so well. beautiful transition into lonely as well!

**rickikardashian** (10): interlude solidarity

**Roxieloxie** (10): i love how this album was like horny bangers and then out of nowhere they we're like 'now lets work on you' like what the fuck i forgot this song existed and now im crying

**seanderlust** (10): so pretty

**SupremeShani** (10): Please Popheads, do not let your interludephobia disrespect this gorgeous tidbit.

**throwaway7650** (10): this will go out early and it shouldn't

**waluigiest** (10): I swear I sing the escalating “I don’t do well under pressure” to myself several times a week

**xaviersi** (10): sooooo many layers of harmonies for an interlude

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): love how dark this is compared to the rest of the album.

**juanolsen** (9.3): i loved how they really went into an instrospective and emotional mood with this song, the lyrics are really good and of course the vocals and production are in point

**geraldinewww** (9.2): anyone play this flash game called auditorium?

**bookthieving** (9): this does not deserve the interludephobia and balladphobia that it will face

**engifear** (9): I wish it was longer, the harmonies are so gorgeous

**LostintheCosmicFire** (9): WHY DOES THIS FEEL LIKE A FULL SONG LOL

**notarobot3675** (9): gorgeous interlude! that harmonising is something else

**runaway3212** (9): cute

**SmileAndTears** (8.9): bye... (third) best song on the album and it's barely even a song

**endcreditouilles** (8.7): can someone help me find my soul, it left my body 4 tracks ago and I think it would really like this song

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): This is way prettier than a short interlude has any right to be

**jman457** (8.6): A very beautiful slow ethereal song, just wish it was longer

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Very angelic, lyrics definitely hit a lot given last year

**pros-and-connors** (8.5): it’s so pretty but so short, why must they hurt me like this ????????

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): This better not go out day 1 just because it is short, this is better than some artists’ entire discography

**afs** (8): I knew CxHxPiano was gonna come at some point, and as expected it's angelic. Ends too soon, but that's how interludes are.

**cremeebrulee** (8): chloe x halle  rina: making interludes that shouldve been full songs

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): this is basically an interlude for lonely in my eyes. I like it a lot though lyrically and I love the layering.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I think this works well as an individual track because their impressive vocals mean that they can give it a vibe beyond just being an intro to “Lonely” and the solo piano backing makes it unique on the album

**ignitethephoenix** (8): gorgeous and relatable but yep it’s an interlude so it doesn’t really compare to the rest of the album

**jsonphile** (8): it’s so short but actually so nice to listen to

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): Gorgeous interlude expressing a very early 20s sentiment.....by their late 20s they'll be ready to add a Fuck This World (Interlude)

**musical\_pyn** (8): the harmonies here are so tight

**nick1372** (8): for what is essentially an interlude this is fairly ambitious! I think it really accomplishes the mood it set out to make

**Oberionsynth** (8): why do artists keep making great songs less than a minute long, girl i'm tryna get my bussy bopping here and with my old soul it takes a couple minutes just to stand up

**pig-serpent** (8): This is glorious! Why isn't this a full song?

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's a pretty good lead-in to Lonely but doesn't really wow me

**Vultuxe** (8): I actually liked this interlude, but I wish it was attached to Lonely. Would have made Lonely a much better song.

**zagreux** (8): the ad-libs or whatever here, whew girl

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): yeah me too

**EnCaine** (7.5): i promised myself i would not be overly interludephobic. this sounds good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): Very pretty and soothing, my super valid complaint is that it’s too short! Even for an interlude, it doesn’t have a real conclusion or breathing space at the end. Just as you start to get into it, it’s over.

**1998tweety** (7): reminds me of kali uchis, we didnt need to rate this but its nice tbh

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Vocal excellence but interludephobia exists

**akanewasright** (7): Cute little interlude. Won’t be interludephobic because it is fantastically done

**bigbigbee** (7): I love this but wish it were longer. I think there’s an amazing musical idea here and I would love to hear it as a full song.

**camerinian** (7): I love Kali Uchis

**cashewconstellation** (7): I can't really rate this cause I didn't even notice it went by and it was so short

**CrimsonROSET** (7): ok but make it longer

**KennyEarthman** (7): a nice breather on the album

**ktajlili** (7): Cute, short interlude that transitions into the more serious songs of the album

**NotWith10000Men** (7): so pretty, it doesn't deserve the thrashing it's gonna get

**Qustomar** (7): me preparing for finals rn

**salivantsonority** (7): Pretty but unspectacular.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): A great song that suffers from just being an interlude. If it was a full song it would be an album highlight

**Uberpigeon** (7): this is a cute interlude dont give it zeros let cxh remain zeroless!!

**wasian-invasion** (7): cute little interlude

**wavingwolves** (7): floating hedgehog emote

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): sounds amazing vocally, but my interludephobia is coming out because this is too short

**amiriteor** (6.5): like its a chloe x halle song idk, extra .5 bc I'm a sucker for those choral harmonies

**bbfan132** (6.5): doesn’t really feel like a song

**poptartchill** (6.5): not sure if this counts as ""popheads hates ballads"" but I respect this song, it just has less relisten value since it's short

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): cute interlude

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): When I think that I'm over you, I'm overpowered. Your data, my data, the chromosomes match. Exact as in matter, a matter of fact. These amaranth feelings - a cognitive state. Need the love object to reciprocate. When I think that I'm over you, I'm overpowered. It's long overdue, I'm overpowered. When I think that I'm over you, I'm overpowered. It's long overdue, I'm overpowered. As science struggles on to try to explain, oxytocins flowing ever into my brain. As science struggles on to try to explain, oxytocins flowing ever into my brain. A chemical reason, if reason's your game. A chemical needing is there in the brain. With pre-programmed meanings, like a little more pep. Alien feelings we have to accept. When I think that I'm over you, I'm overpowered. It's long overdue, I'm overpowered. When I think that I'm over you, I'm overpowered. It's long overdue, I'm overpowered. As science struggles on to try to explain, oxytocins flowing ever into my brain. As science struggles on to try to explain, oxytocins flowing ever into my brain. I'm overpowered.

**hakkerj** (6): I didn't know how to rate song

**Itsafudgingstick** (6): Unfortunately I can only rate this song so high because it is a short interlude, but it is very purdy

**Palutzel** (6): more of an interlude than a song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): A pretty interlude but an interlude nonetheless.

**frogaranaman** (5): interludephobia

**liberalitea** (5): it's great for what it is but i can't give it any higher than a 5

**martian\_pet** (5): Underwhelming

**Stryxen** (5): me when i have to do a single task in a day

**urfavgalpal** (5): honestly the score feels a too low for it because I think it’s a great interlude but it doesn’t really work as a stand-alone and should probably rank lower than most of the other songs in this rate

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): An interlude that I really could do without, it really could do with a proper ballad here to cool down here instead of like a 52 second strange intermission that sounds unfinished.

# Calls something 'camp' when it's just bad

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is gonna do poorly because Bloodpop, but I like bloodpop’s production.

**bespectacIed** (10): this was camp

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): y’all are SO MEAN to this song for absolutely no reason… like this is the kind of queer house pop that we beg our faves to release but when Rina actually does it everyone bitches because it sounds like *Chromatica*... well maybe if *Chromatica* had sounded more like this it wouldn’t have flopped in the other Ultimate rate

**hikkaru** (10): it bops idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc

**LuisEnRod** (10): rain on me, rain rain rain on me

**ManofOranges** (10): I dig it.

**notarobot3675** (10): so good! and the music video is so fun

**salivantsonority** (10): Even though it's a Rain On Me knockoff, bop.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): sometimes I just wanna dance

**vayyiqra** (10): I already know you flops are going to tank this so do your worst, you tasteless peons (this is a joke I love you all). This is a BOP. I'll be praying for you that someday you see the light and admit to yourselves that this is fun. Until then, farewell.

**waluigiest** (10): okay yeah it’s really really good

**artzpop** (9): some people may call it an obvious reach for a radio hit, I call it art

**bigbigbee** (9): I think this is overhated! It sounds like Rain on Me, which I loved. I won’t say no to more of a good thing.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): i get why people hate it, but i think they missed the point. it's just so catchy. it's a forever 21 bop. it's the type of song you buy too small shirts to. it's one of those, please get me out of this store i'm too old for this songs. i hate it, which means i love it.

**skargardin** (9): insert stale bloodpop take here

**Stryxen** (9): sawayamatica

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): Unpopular opinion but I love this song, it’s so nostalgic and summery. Weak lyrics but really strong delivery imo

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): God Rina is so beautiful… and this song is too!

**xaviersi** (9): if this came out before chromatica it would have definitely been a 10 but it just feels inauthentic coming after the fact

**celladonn** (8.5): One of my favourite songs on Chromatica

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Rina could do Chromatica but Gaga could never do LUCID

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): rina sapphicyama

**seanderlust** (8.3): ""is #RinaLUCID about masturbating ????????? maybe !!!!!!!!!!"" - critically acclaimed musical artist Rina Sawayama

**urfavgalpal** (8.2): okay I kinda didn’t like this one at first cause it’s very like Bloodpop and I’m kinda eh in Bloodpop so to me the production sounded kinda shallow compared to the entirety of SAWAYAMA but it really is a grower.  It’s a catchy little bop. And while Rina is not a lesbian I think it would be disrespectful to my flair if I didn’t endorse this song given the subject matter

**akanewasright** (8): I just love Rina’s voice on everything

**Alumineous** (8): I actually liked it when it first came out, but I kinda don't care about it anymore. I have ran to the song several times, so it's still a dope song. I also didn't love love Chromatica, so I'm very ehhh on BloodPop and his generic beats.

**conceptualromance** (8): bloodpop a one trick pony at this point but Rina makes it work!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Yeah, this is definitely a BloodPop-produced track alright.

**ggal2020** (8): I’d never heard this song, only the hate for it, and I must say that while it is different from sawayama, it still slaps hard. bloodpop isn’t evil, lucid and chromatica are good shit.

**J\_Toe** (8): works better with the Rain on Me instrumentation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBf34SLEaIE

**jasannn** (8): Better than Chromatica

**Oberionsynth** (8): Probably unpopular but I really enjoy this song. love the WLW representation too

**Palutzel** (8): yass take us to chromatica

**pheromenos** (8): i like bloodpop's production here tho

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): it’s a Chromatica track so therefore I do like it to some extent

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): this is overhated. I get that its basic but it does still bop

**kirby31200** (7.5): So nice of Bloodpop to give Rina Gaga's scraps

**nick1372** (7.5): yes I know BloodPop ruins everything he touches. Yes I know we should have left his career in 2017 where it belongs. Yes I know this sounds like a Chromatica C-side. It’s still a queer masturbation anthem and it slaps!

**pig-serpent** (7.5): How can the drop be that annoying but also slap that hard?

**cashewconstellation** (7.4): the song is bad but it kind of bops i am not elaborating

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**frogaranaman** (7): how is this any different than some basic pride anthem made by some white pop star I don’t get the hate

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its fine

# Calls something bad when it's actually camp

**throwaway7650** (7.5): the chorus is just so uninspired... the rest of the song is fine

**afs** (7): Feel-good British club now, any genre left? Its mashup with Rain On Me is sooooo good though.

**bbfan132** (7): not amazing but much better than rym would have you think lol, this sound works better for her than i expected it to

**jaztinax** (7): i’d rather be dry but at least i’m aliveeeeee

**oscarbrierley1** (7): fun but kinda basic for her

**WhyDoIExistXD** (7): Bloodpop ruined it

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7): ; this does sound like a Gaga leftover

**geraldinewww** (6.9): me every single time this started on the rate playlist: huh wait why is chromatica on this

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): yeah it sounds like a chromatica goes trop pop outtake.... :/

**hakkerj** (6.3): Compared to the rest of the tracks on SAWAYAMA this one definitely falls short. It's a fun song, but not the type of music I am normally into. I am glad that it is just a deluxe track.

**EnCaine** (6): i did not care for chromatica :/

**engifear** (6): This is gonna get a lot more ones than it deserves

**LostintheCosmicFire** (6): bl*dpp really had the audacity to ruin a potentially sapphic anthem about masturbating and I hate that it sounds so much like rain on me, deplatform him.Rina slays with her vocals as always

**ReallyCreative** (6): god damn, it's not unpleasant to listen to, but there is so much more that could be done with Rina than this. Also I'm calling Kamala and arresting every producer/songwriter that puts a drop as a chorus or utilizes no lyrics/vocals as a chorus. It needs to be a federal crime YESTERDAY.

**SupremeShani** (6): i am open to revising my score if bloodpop ends up delivering on this chromatica remix album

**thedoctordances1940** (6): It's fine, not really something I'd expect from her but whatever

**welcome2thejam** (6): She does her best, but not feeling that drop. Kinda basic without the right punch or bounce to elevate it.

**jman457** (5.3): Its sounds like a lady gaga reject song

**amiriteor** (5): this was disappointing and boring also wheres the anthem for sleep paralysis HUH!

**fairytalehigh** (5): this... should have been left on the cutting room floor of the chromatica sessions where it belongs. SORRY RINA I LOVE YOU

**KennyEarthman** (5): I can't believe Rina released a single for Chromatica

**liberalitea** (5): fck bloodpop for ruining Rina's almost flawless discography. at least this song is sapphic.

**musical\_pyn** (5): this is my new standard for a 5

**Vultuxe** (5): I liked it until the drop

**iniekcja\_** (4.5): bl**dpop discourse aside, it really feels regressive

**nootnoot781** (4): rina, never leave clarence clarity EVER

**RandomHypnotica** (4): OK, this isn't as awful as everyone makes it out to be, but it's SO generic, painfully generic. Anybody could've sung this song, and it's a comparitively dull point in Rina's discography

**targetguest** (4): not my fav

**fadedblue09** (3): who let Lady Gaga into this rate

**IIIHenryIII** (3): It sounds like a Chromatica track, not better not worse. Actually, it sounds like a worse version of Rain On Me, and that song is not that good.

**letsallpoo** (3): someday bloodpop will pay for his crimes

**plastichaxan** (3): bloodpop you're gonna d word in 7 days

**static\_int\_husp** (3): Truly a chromatica reject

**welcometoNY** (3): society has progressed past the need for bloodpop

**shhhneak** (2): Bloodpop set her up with this production.

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): Bloodpop peaked with the Ready For It remix.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1): the hold blood pop has need to be stopped…

**runaway3212** (1): weak for her

I don't know if this is garage - well I do know, and it is not - but it certainly takes influence from early 2010's UK garage and that sound is really weirdly comforting to me because it reminds me of my sister and the phase she had where she was obsessed with it. Anyway this song works well for me, it's speedy and doesn't overstay it's welcome, though I do kinda get why it flopped so hard here, because it definitely tackles the same themes as several other songs here and does it much less interestingly.

# OMG I get it!

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Once I heard the robot song from Spongebob played over the lyrics to this thing I was 100% sold on this shit lol. God it is so catchy.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a sad bop

**LuisEnRod** (10): that therapist line hits extra hard lol

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this song is SO overhated. Like, ridiculously overhated. When this first released, I felt like the only person who loved this. The garage beat is really different for Charli, but works well, and in the context of this album, it really nicely ties up the ""I Hate Myself"" trilogy

**urfavgalpal** (10): this is the last of the songs that I really love on this album and I really love it!  This whole stretch gives me elevated N1A vibes I really love it so much.  I particularly love here how perfect the transition is.   The voice memo sets this song up beautifully and wow the lyrics are amazing.  I get chills listening to this one tbh.

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): this baseline is impeccable

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): make it longer, charli, you coward

**Vultuxe** (9.5): This is an interesting one... I think it's the catchiest song on the record, so much so that I can look past the lyrics.

**fairytalehigh** (9.4): the stuttered chorus is so fucking catchy, she really snapped

**bbfan132** (9): :puggofast:

**iniekcja\_** (9): I absolutely despise this song, it brings pain and trauma, I hate it with a passion, it should be criminalized, it killed my cow and fucked my man, IFY is a cunt, I love IFY so much, why is IFY a cunt? I never said that, we got you saying it seconds ago, IFY is my friend

**nick1372** (9): “my therapist says I hate myself really bad” is such a childish yet incredible line

**nooodisaster** (9): It's a serve, what do you want me to say?

**vayyiqra** (9): I support almost any song that normalizes therapy.

**waluigiest** (9): charli stans aren’t brave enough to admit this is a good song. -1 point because I miss when the instrumentals dropped out in the demo

**Brendon-Urine** (8.5): a fantastic song, but in comparison to the rest of HIFN this is a dud - ONLY charli could make that happen

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): i love the uk garage influence on this a lot, v fish n’ chips

**cremeebrulee** (8): it genuinely sounds like she’s singing “dababy i love you bad”

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): I really didn’t like the hug it out lyric otherwise it’s fun and I like the liquid lines.

**endcreditouilles** (8): [yes hello i was wondering if you could play that song again, the one that goes bee boo boo bop boo boo beep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_i4FbzaYww)

**ManofOranges** (8): Me after learning enough spanish to know what ""Hola ¿Cómo estás?"" means.

**Oberionsynth** (8): imagine charli with an american accent, i literally cAHnt

**akanewasright** (7.9): Bop, but less of a bop than the stretch that came right before it

**hakkerj** (7.9): This song really grew on me after more listens

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.8): I could’ve sworn this samples Party at a Rich Dude’s House by Kesha. Not my favourite musically but the frantic energy is compelling, it does sound like a burst of motivation after dragging yourself out of depression sludge. “My therapist says I hate myself really bad” iconic line

**amiriteor** (7.6): maybe

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): The drumbeat is really awesome.

**throwaway7650** (7.5): cute song

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): It sounds like she's saying dababy i love you bad

**1998tweety** (7): cute, chorus is catchy

**afs** (7): I thought she was gonna sample Party at a Rich Dude's House at first lmao. Also I realised I've heard this before on the radio. It's alright.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this reminds me of a remix of a 90s eurodance song. Not a 90s eurodance song, but specifically a remix of one.

**KennyEarthman** (7): bouncy bop that. loved it, even tho I forgot half the lyrics after

**pat-rickstar** (7): This will probably be one of the first songs out and it's not deserved

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): but the lyrics are relatable asf just another song i wanted some explosive chaos out of. i think i might be coming around to hyperpop.

**shhhneak** (7): the British accent jumped out on this one.

**jman457** (6.7): I like the melodies on this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): alright this one has a groove

# Wait can you explain that one more time

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I don’t

**UselessTacooo** (7.9): I barely remember this one

**ggal2020** (7.5): I think I would’ve liked this song much more if it weren’t a single

**juanolsen** (7): i literally forgot about the existence of this track

**pig-serpent** (7): Normally DnB based songs are among the highlights of their respected album but this one is relatively uninteresting. The bassline is enough to prop it up though.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): This just feels unemotional and dead inside even for her. Fun instrumental though

**runaway3212** (6.5): I don't really love this, but think it's a tad overhated

**bespectacIed** (6): sounds like a rookie kpop girl group release ...something from WEEEKLY or STAYC maybe lmao. it's fun

**cashewconstellation** (6): uhhhhhhhhhhhhh kinda bad (also i HATE the way she says understand)

**hikkaru** (6): i don't

**ignitethephoenix** (6): love how raw the lyrics are too bad the song is very mid and kind of boring

**jasannn** (6): yeah, sorta basic.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (6): This one is fine, but no......I do not finally understand the hype around this album (sry I love you Charli)

**ktajlili** (6): The production on the rest of the album is so fire, then there's this...it's just okay.

**ReallyCreative** (6): literally never me, what the fuck Charli I have never understood anything in my fucking life, how fucking dare you rub this in my face

**bigbigbee** (5.5): I think that the best tracks on this album are when she’s creating energy and hype, or when she’s focusing on a really pretty, strong melody. To me, this track lacks both of those.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): feel like i don't rlly have anything to say about this

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (5.5): Catchy, but not super noteworthy. Also it’s weird that I’m just now noticing this but a lot of these songs are about the same thing

**CarlieScion** (5): so mid

**CrimsonROSET** (5): well I dont

**Itsafudgingstick** (5): Unfortunately I just do not understand why this song has never worked for me :/

**musical\_pyn** (5): doesn't really go anywhere

**salivantsonority** (5): Pretty classic baseline but I can't imagine listening to it under any context.

**SupremeShani** (5): me when i lie when popheads asks me to listen to this album one more time

**thedoctordances1940** (5): really uninteresting, nothing bad, nothing good either

**wavingwolves** (4.8): ""my therapist says i hate myself really bad"" well i don't need a therapist to tell me that but u do u charli

**Qustomar** (4.5): Catchy, I like the beat! But it just doesn't feel like a completed song lol.

**frogaranaman** (4): really weird song in the pacing of the album

**NotWith10000Men** (4): the verses are cool but the chorus is so droning

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Maybe (bebebe) this song is a bit too obnoxious...

While I can understand a lot of people find this *too* abrasive and just charli sing-talking over noise, I really enjoy it, and honestly thought it was less divisive than it evidently is, so I was surprised at this staying mid day 1 for pretty much the entire rate. Sure, it’s not as good as Next Level Charli, but it is fun :D

**bbfan132** (11): absolutely fucking brilliant, already know it’ll be robbed

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Perfect opener, bangs hard, like what can I really say? Even the rapping on this thing is cool

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This goes ~~off~~ real hard

**bulforster** (10): You want to go real hard? Well guess what Charli, you did.

**camerinian** (10): PUNCH ME IN THE FUCKING FACE CHARLI

**CreepyMannequin** (10): This was a big contender for my 11. It just...goes so hard, you could say.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The album peaks with its intro track. It's a career-highlight for Charli (and is better than Next Level Charli).

**fairytalehigh** (10): pretty sure this song is about showing off yr hoo-ha on the webcam and i'm 100% here for that energy, charlotte

**hikkaru** (10): im going feral

**kirby31200** (10): Death Grips for gay people

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): Iconic intro,I feel this is a more sincere expression of what people were feeling during this pandemic than forever.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is just that meme of gay people's taste in music being the worst thing you’ve ever heard

**Oberionsynth** (10): the beat to this song is the top I've needed during quarantine ugh, even tho we made her sign a douche she really made a song for the bottoms, QUEEN

**plastichaxan** (10): this goes off too hard, i know y'all will do it dirty for whatever reason but this is just perfect

**racloves** (10): goes real hard

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Starting the album off a VERY strong note, Charli really did go real hard here. When that guitar hits, I'm sent into the stratosphere it's so hard.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I love this industrial moment, iconic intro

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Charli please tag your Steven Universe spoilers

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this song is my gateway to her entire discog and even hyperpop in general, the impact alone deserve a 10

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Charli's openors are always way too amped up

**targetguest** (10): this song has been in my daily rotation since coming out, it hasn't gotten old

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): ; Charli constantly knows how to open an album

**amiriteor** (9.7): i wanna do coke ?

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): every lyric is a potential insta caption

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): kinda feelin like a slut in this pic, might delete later idk tho

**Palutzel** (9.5): it goes hard and it's only the intro

**seanderlust** (9.5): well this does go hard

**artzpop** (9): this song makes me go feral

**celladonn** (9): me when i just wanna go real hard

**conceptualromance** (9): thank u bennifer

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): If this song is an actual pink diamond in the flesh, it would definitely be too hot to touch cause this song goes off.

**iniekcja\_** (9): Lil Uzi Vert is shaking

**izeaklapaucius** (9): getting jojo siwa vibe from this beat

**ktajlili** (9): i love this intro because it's so chaotic and high energy.

**mudkip1** (9): fuck i hated this when it first dropped but whatever it slaps

**nick1372** (9): sometimes you just wanna go real hard idk what else to say

**pig-serpent** (9): After the experimental bangers Click and I Shake it, Pink Diamond is what I wanted a Charli album to sound like. An early favorite and I was disappointed at first there wasn't more like it, but over time I realized that 2020 just wasn't the time for a Pink Diamond Summer and I overall prefer the sound of the rest of the album because of it.

**Qustomar** (9): Edgy Charli is maybe my fave genre of Charli? Would've given a 10 or 11 if this was a full song but it works very well as an intro, kinda the successor of Next Level Charli.

**SupremeShani** (9): A fantastic opener, I think Charli's clean and straightforward songwriting really benefits when it's paired up with the harshest hyperpop sounds possible like this.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): elle woods would approve of this song title

**thedoctordances1940** (9): this goes hard!

**vayyiqra** (9): Abrasive but it bangs.

**waluigiest** (9): pop off steven universe

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): My favorite car crash song

**UselessTacooo** (8.9): iconic

**1998tweety** (8.5): I must admit this is quite good, the chorus is mega catchy

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): I too just want to go real hard

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): ""Got a tiny bag but I got a big heart"" who can relate

**throwaway7650** (8.5): is it weird to consider this song kind of like a sequel to vroom vroom? anyway this is my favorite song on HIFN, hope it does well!

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): its a good song but it is just a low rent next level charli. previous level charli, you might say.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): This feels so specific to the early quarantine period before we all settled into general apathy and despair

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): so true

**juanolsen** (8.4): best way to open the album, the production is great and Charli's lyrics are clever and fun ask always

**Dekubaku** (8.2): Pink Diamond right out says how hard the album is going to go. And it does!

**hakkerj** (8.2): Get me out of this quarantine cage right NOW

**jman457** (8.2): such a “hard” way to open an album

**salivantsonority** (8.1): It's just the industrial moment. Charli invented concrete, probably.

**akanewasright** (8): BOP

**EnCaine** (8): it goes real hard

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): This song is legitimately insane? There are several songs on this album that feel like almost a 2020 answer to Charli’s 2019 album Charli – this intro track is most definitely an updated version of “Next Level Charli” to me – grimy in the best way

**lagozzino** (8): I swear half the shit y'all call hyperpop is just late 00s industrial club mixes.

**nooodisaster** (8): I'm obsessed with the entire first verse of this. ""Lip gloss on and I'm lookin' like a star / Got a tiny bag, but I got a big heart / On the video chat, cute skirt and a bra / I'm feeling so fine, kinda feelin' like a slut""

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): this is a good opener for this album, and i love the sheer amount of noise happening? i feel like this dropping at a concert would make me lose my shit

**poptartchill** (8): it's a catchy opener

**pros-and-connors** (8): this song has Bimini Bon Boulash energy and no one can tell me otherwise

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): One of her better opening tracks methinks!

**zagreux** (8): https://imgur.com/a/3Jso1dx

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): I do really want to go real hard ... but I’m still unvaccinated in a panera

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Why am I not hating this more

**geraldinewww** (7.5): don't we all just wanna go real hard

**J\_Toe** (7): The first time I listened to Pop2 (particularly Track 10) I noped out of there as the sound was too aggressive and unfamiliar. But I quickly came back to the EP. I had a similar response to Shake It on Charli. I skipped the song half way through as it was too aggressive, but returned after singing it to myself over and over again the next week. Pink Diamond is the equivalent track for this album. I initially hated it, but it's now one of my favourites :)

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): wish it was longer tbh

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): As wild and abrasive as this song is… I kinda wish it were longer haha

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): not bad? Not what I expected. I actually enjoy the verses

# Are you that blue light

**cashewconstellation** (7.2): not bad, like the energy but it could benefit from being longer and more fleshed out

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): It goes real hard but it's a bit repetitive.

**jasannn** (7): She has done better abrasive songs.

# Knows the difference between arteries and veins

**bespectacIed** (10): It's gorgeous. I wish this was on the main album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is the best song on the album.

**conceptualromance** (10): the production is really beautiful <3 Feels less busy and more spacious than a lot of the other songs on here.

**fadedblue09** (10): The one song everyone hates is somehow my favorite lol. I just love this, it's like the perfect waltzy slow-dance number, and one of the few times Carly showed emotion in this otherwise emotionless record.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I still say this should’ve been the opener or closer for Dedicated

**nick1372** (10): love love love Carly when she gets slow and sensual

**notarobot3675** (10): another song that is just... peak romance. carly really does know how to make pop that just... perfectly embodies the feelings a good romcom gives you.

**ReallyCreative** (10): I don't care this is one of her best ballads

**TiltControls** (10): I'm not ready for the balladphobia cause this is gorgeous

**waluigiest** (10): idc this song is beautiful. It’s an introspective, ballad take on Too Much

**anothertown** (9.5): there are a lot of sounds going on here and they’re all great

**shhhneak** (9.5): God I love that bridge.

**engifear** (9): This is such a gorgeous song, but I'm afraid about how it will do because I don't trust y'all balladphobes out there

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Ballodphobia better be kind to this one, it’s so soft and pillowy

**hakkerj** (9): All That 2.0

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I love the weird stuff happening in the background (I'm no music expert). It is fascinating how it works on a track so soothing and calm like this one. Also, not Carly using an actual heartbeat on a track titled Heartbeat. Now I'll take a break to listen to Wildest Dreams.

**musical\_pyn** (9): such a cathartic and warm song

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This one is going to be robbed, she’s cute

**savemeaseat143** (8.8): feels like a hug

**bbfan132** (8.5): love the hazy production, gives me 80s vibes

**seanderlust** (8.5): there's nothing quite like hooking up/dating someone who's really great and having that moment where you're like ""oh wow...I am TRASH.""

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): All That's cute little sister

**vagenda** (8.5): It kind of stops the momentum of the album dead in its tracks but taken in isolation, for what it is, it’s honestly a really nice ballad

**juanolsen** (8.3): a really good laid back track, i like how it reminds me of all that

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): woo-hoo-HOO, woo-HOO-HOO, WOO-HOO-HOO

**jman457** (8.1): a very beautiful slow jam

**Alumineous** (8): Serves the same function as Chosen Family on SAWAYAMA. It's a good break from all the dancing in the first 5 tracks.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This is good so I am giving it an 8. But I have a feeling that this song will grow on me that I should have given this a 9 instead. But 8 is a score that I am confident giving right now.

**Leixander** (8): Unfortunate placement in the album, sandwiched between two of Carly's best songs ever.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): This is a REALLY cute, delicate track that is absolutely going to get robbed

**SupremeShani** (8): There's a part of me that has a soft spot for Carly's synth ballads, like All That and No Drug Like Me. All fundamentally different songs, but I think her sweet voice always pairs with those more subdued electronic sounds just activates some happiness in my brain.

**throwaway7650** (8): another good chorus... carly is so good at them. this song is super calming and ironically feels like it could help slow down heartbeats lol

**vayyiqra** (8): Maybe hot take but Carly's ballads are highly underrated and have some of her best songs.

**cashewconstellation** (7.9): i'm not usually a fan of slow songs but this one is quite good and is also very relatable for me ""i don't wanna tell you anything about me"" go off carly

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): the bridge kind of saves it from becoming just a correct ballad

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Really nice lyrically, it's a gay vibe

**Palutzel** (7.5): slow bop

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): the All That of Dedicated era

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.1): For a song about speeding up heartbeats this is pretty snoozy, but I still like low-key Carly

**afs** (7): I'm not into ballads but this has got a lot of interesting elements in it.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): That weird drum heartbeat in the bridge is what makes this good.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): Omg Carly don't make me cry when I want to bop

**salivantsonority** (7): Bit maudlin but I'm not mad at it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): aww this is sweet!

This is so slept on it's criminal, it's so goddamn fun, if this was entirely in English I just know it would've made day 3 :woeis:. Regardless, I'm happy it made it as far as it did, being a song not even available on streaming platforms for most of the world, and I'm happy I only got very few comments referencing Gwen Stefani on this song.

# Abolish region locking

**salivantsonority** (11): THIS NOT OFFICIALLY BEING ON THE RECORD REMAINS HIGHWAY ROBBERY. What a dope ass bitch track. Blows your fuckin' socks off.

**conceptualromance** (10): she’s sick for keeping this from us

**CrimsonROSET** (10): its a smasha, but i wish it came BEFORE snakeskin.

**seanderlust** (10): i don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl i'm headbanging

**sirpancakeXI** (10): she is so wrong for not putting it on streaming

**Stryxen** (10): spelling is fun joke

**throwaway7650** (10): this is actually so good? omg, hope this doesn't tank

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): Oh how I wish this song was on Spotify. It combines the best parts of different songs off of the album into one frankenstein-esque monster of a bop

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Release this internationally challenge

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): put it on Spotify RINA

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Yeah this bangs and I hoped it would be included on the deluxe version

**cremeebrulee** (9): deserved to be on the main album

**EnCaine** (9): i didn't know this existed WHAT

**juanolsen** (9): japanese speaking rina is the best rina

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): I had never heard this before, but okay Rina, this goes hard

**musical\_pyn** (9): why is this an exclusive!!!

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's fun and it's unfortunate that I cannot stream it

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Put this on Spotify queen I’m begging

**wavingwolves** (9): i feel like this will be bottom 5 and undeservedly so because it's amazing

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9): ; she’s sick for not putting this on the official album

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): https://imgur.com/a/lyYTrBg

**1998tweety** (8.5): SMASHA get this on streaming NOW

**jman457** (8.5): sure its probably best in the Bonus rate but it sill slaps.

**Palutzel** (8.3): first listen for me, crazy good song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.2): this was new to me during this rate, I feel like such a fake Rina stan! It goes off!!

**akanewasright** (8): This is a bop and a half, but I 100% get why she left this off the main album. She fucked up by not putting it on the deluxe though

**CarlieScion** (8): this could’ve been in camp rock

**cashewconstellation** (8): i don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl i'm living

**celladonn** (8): I've never heard this before! Secret bop unlocked...

**CreepyMannequin** (8): wait this goes off

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I like how most of the song is in Japanese. It's no wonder why reserved this as a Japanese bonus track. Would be nice to see this on streaming tho!

**frogaranaman** (8): I cannot believe this is region locked wtf

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I guess I like this one?

**just\_thonking** (8): wait now I'm mad you made me listen to this song because I like it and it's not on spotify >:(

**KennyEarthman** (8): oh wow I'm glad I listen to music on YouTube cuz I heard this wasn't on Spotify, y'all are missing out

**ktajlili** (8): only heard this song once but it was fun.

**ManofOranges** (8): It's cute

**moooo566** (8): At least she saved the least great song on the album for the exclusive, I guess?

**mudkip1** (8): love the verses but dont like the chorus

**Oberionsynth** (8): why are the best songs never on the streaming services T.T

**racloves** (8): she was evil for not releasing this worldwide I’m considering tracking down a Japan cd tbh

**runaway3212** (8): should've been on the main album

**skargardin** (8): region exclusive tracks must be stopped

**slimboyfriend** (8): She should've taken one of the two weak tracks off the album and put this one between STFU! and Comme De Garçons

**SupremeShani** (8): I will never like region locked album tracks, but it's Rina so all is forgiven. Am I a bad Pixel for not even knowing this song existed before this rate though?

**vayyiqra** (8): Wow I didn't know this existed. I've always wanted to hear Rina do a whole song in Japanese and this gives an idea of what that'd be like.

**amiriteor** (7.9): i would def like it more if i listened to club bangers more often but if this came on at a club i would def take 2 shots of vodka no prob

**Dekubaku** (7.8): Discovering this song just right now. Good song but IMO, snakeskin was the right ending, IMO.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): I can see why Rina didn't include this on the standard edition, it's a good track but it doesn't really fit anywhere in the tracklist nicely

**Itsafudgingstick** (7.5): This was fun, this was festive; I wish it wasn’t region locked so I could shove it onto my hype songs playlist. It’s like Hollaback Girls but unironically good!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): why is this region locked RUDE

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): why does japan get all the bops

# Spelling is not fun!

**NecroDolphinn** (7.2): Hey Kids Spelling Is Fun!

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): I don't really mind this song as a whole, maybe it's because the song is on YouTube but the mix just feels really muddy, I have a feeling that the guitar jams interpolated throughout are supposed to feel just as electrifying as in XS, but they just come off as a bit blunt. The way they did Rina's vocals are also kind of weird, not a big fan of her doing this cheerleading thing, methinks. Still not a really bad track as a Deluxe track (No, this isn't the closer, at least not officially...) that is pretty sticky and decently hard-hitting.

**afs** (7): annoyed that I had to listen to this seperately but also get why it's Japan only lol, reminds me a bit of MANiCURE

**hikkaru** (7): i do kinda see why this is not on the actual album

**nick1372** (7): production on this kind of gives me a headache and I’m not sure what purpose the chorus serves? Still I do like the concept of the song and it definitely adds to the album as a whole when included.

**nooodisaster** (7): she did what she had to do

**NotWith10000Men** (7): tell me why I want to watch all of teen titans now?

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): i don't understand the inclusion, and i don't love the dated sound here. it legit sounds like it's from 2007, not just referencing it. and the x-tina staaaaaaaay part is just eugh. we don't even like it when she does that.

**Raykel** (7): Has anyone noticed that Rina's music on some platforms is so loud? Like if I watch her insta stories I know I'm gonna have to turn the volume down or else an audio clip of one of her song's might come blasting in and startle me...like it did with this youtube video lol.

**SmileAndTears** (7): ok

**urfavgalpal** (6.7): if this had been on the original album maybe I would have listened to this enough times that it grew on me and I liked it.  I don’t think it’s bad necessarily I’m just not into the sound much.  Maybe it’s cause it’s made to appeal to a music market that I’m not a part of

**camerinian** (6.5): Is the vocal mixing locked behind a different region too

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): queen of region locking

**Vultuxe** (6.5): I was really fucking with it until the spelling, unfortunately that took me right out of the song.

**bbfan132** (6): the concept is cool but the production sounds off and it brings the song down for me… :/

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I remember liking this more than I actually do.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): the mixing (?) on the vocals isn’t the best, but the production on this is impeccable and I really wish that she did more songs in Japanese",Awkward_King,,5,5,2021-05-28 20:48:02

It was so funny to me getting all these ballots and seeing how few people gave both Felt This Way and Stay Away high scores, Carly really waged a war within her own fanbase simply by releasing two of the same song. Evidently this one didn't fair quite as well as it's other half, and as nice as it is, I certainly see why! This is one of those songs I kind of find myself getting bored of halfway through, because it tends to repeat itself quite a bit.

---

# Felt This Way Supremacy

**1998tweety** (10): masterpiece

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): Far better than Stay Away

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): one of her best songs

**bespectacIed** (10): This deserves to be in the main album

**CarlieScion** (10): the horny version of stay away

**cashewconstellation** (10): a standout in her discography, the ENERGY OF ""if it was only an attraction, how come nobody ever felt this way"" carly owns my ass

**fairytalehigh** (10): best moment on the album. the bottom anthem of 2020. gay yearning incarnate. we stan

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): :(

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I can't stay away (away, away, away, away), this part is so catchy. It's so chill and emotional.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song makes me feel some type of way, that being incredibly good. It puts me in a trance that Carly just says ""if it was only an attraction how come nobody ever felt this way?"" It's absolutely mesmerizing and grooves me down to the core of my existence.

**nick1372** (10): The slightly better of the two versions, if only because Carly sounds a bit more comfortable cooing then belting

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song is sexy as fuck, i love it. want more of this sound from her, too.

**poptartchill** (10): I know it's part of the pair but this is by far the superior one

**Tedyonce** (10): I already know Popheads will do this song dirty

**vagenda** (10): People will rate this lower than Stay Away because it’s the slow one, but it’s just as perfect

**wavingwolves** (10): everytime i listen to this it's like having carly gaslight me into thinking i'm in love with someone

**welcometoNY** (10): the fact that she had a song this good and then went and made it into another song just as good and had the audacity to put neither of them on the main record...sick and twisted

**zagreux** (10): I love love love love love love her voice on slow songs like these. also felt this way into stay away is better than chromatica II into 911

**nooodisaster** (9.5): Sultry, great momentum, this one is an endless wave pool lapping up against you, the warm water inviting and relaxing.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): the lesser twin but still a serve

**savemeaseat143** (9.5): makes me cry

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): listening to these two was so confusing the first time i heard this, really cool idea ms carly!

**bulforster** (9.3): I'm a Felt This Way supremacist.

**Alumineous** (9): This sounds so innocent, but then she says ""the city's so hard"". Fuck, I'm mentally 12 years old lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I'm almost always a fan of the more low-key CRJ songs and this is no exception

**Brendon-Urine** (9): this shit diabetic fr

**juanolsen** (9): a real classic Carly song, i love everything about it

**notarobot3675** (9): THE ROMANCE

**Oberionsynth** (9): i love it when carly uses a softer tone rather like here omg i'm whipped

**pros-and-connors** (9): this feels like the electricity in the air before you kiss someone for the first time, I’m obsessed

**Turpamutteri** (9): I love how she decided to put both Felt This Way and Stay Away on this album, it's a really cool idea

**waluigiest** (9): Felt This Way/Stay Away is hands down the biggest serve of this album

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): I honestly can't decide which version is better so I'm giving both the same score lololol

**akanewasright** (8.5): This song just makes me feel all nice and fuzzy inside

**conceptualromance** (8.5): a classic CRJ horny moment

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): i tried to give this the same score as stay away but i really prefer that version so much more

**fadedblue09** (8.5): There's an introspective feel here that makes this one of the standouts.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): There’s a nice hypnotic vibe to this one, it makes me feel like I’m walking through the city on a chilly afternoon just kinda thinking about *him*… Also the “away away away away” refrain always makes me kinda think of “Cranes In The Sky”

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): She's cute, very chilled

**endcreditouilles** (8.3): me: mom can we get Stay Away / mom: we have Stay Away at home / the Stay Away at home:

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Part 1 of the ""I CAN'T STAY AWAY"" song idea, it's a nice softer but still somewhat romantic and song that Carly pulls you in with her rather gentle singing. Really lacks of the oomph of Stay Away though

**hakkerj** (8): I love the chill sexy vibe of this song, that is when I like Carly most

**iniekcja\_** (8): this isn't spectacular in any way but at the same time checks off all the boxes

**jsonphile** (8): wait this is just the same song

**pig-serpent** (8): Smooth song with a nice melody and interesting rhythms.

**runaway3212** (8): beautiful

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This one is the chill sister you would probably smoke weed and do spontaneous road trips to national parks with

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.8): ok i really love the chill, muted vibe

**jaztinax** (7.5): i hadn’t heard this prior to the rate but i had listened to stay away a lot so i’m cONFUSED. i can’t tell if i like this one or stay away more tho

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): This song suffers the same way a lot songs on Dedicated (the main album) do for me and it's that the song is almost a bit too laid back and uninteresting. It's still a really good song, don't get me wrong, but it feels like it could be better...

**throwaway7650** (7.5): cute song and chorus in particular

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.5): I did not know the lyrics on this were literally the same as Stay Away until I read the post for this rate??? This is my personal favorite of the two, but they’re both great

**Vromega** (7.5): I really like the beat but her voice seems a bit too superficial. Not fond of the production

**AHSWeeknd** (7): So many questions but no answers! We want answers!

**anothertown** (7): takes way too long to get to the choruses which are the good part

**brenda\_official** (7): she should have put a transition between the two and made it one song that would have been the serve of all time

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Hi belb!

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like elements of this but I don’t love it

**KennyEarthman** (7): has a driving to the beach vibe

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): Classic Carly ""ballad"" (still a bop)

**liberalitea** (7): it's slower, but i think it's a really pretty song

**musical\_pyn** (7): this is so intimate and I defintiely like this better than stay away

**sirpancakeXI** (7): a worse version of stay away

**SupremeShani** (7): Invented songwriting and music, Carly's impact knows no bounds.

**targetguest** (7): possibly my least favorite on the album, but Carly never misses

**Vultuxe** (7): I like Felt This Way, I feel the production doesn't exactly match how sensual the song is trying to be.

# Stay Away Supremacy

**bbfan132** (8.5): i prefer stay away but i like the mellower feel of this version too

**jasannn** (8): Stay Away outsold but I love how they share lyrics but elicit two different moods.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): inferior

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): I appreciate this as the lesser version of Stay Away

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): these early Dedicated Side B tracks blend together so much that I almost wrote this score for the wrong song multiple times before the song ended

**urfavgalpal** (6.4): The biggest crime this song commits is being my less favorite of the Felt This Way/Stay Away pairing.  It’s a nice song and if Stay Away weren’t on the album I might rank it higher.  I enjoy it in the context of the album, and I actually think it helps build some anticipation for Stay Away that in turn makes that song more enjoyable.  I think it’s really neat to see how the same lyrics can create two completely different tracks and gives a neat insight to the writing process, but personally I tend to enjoy Carly’s upbeat tracks more and so I will always choose to listen to Stay Away over this.

**afs** (6): soft and frankly boring, though I thought this was Stay Away at first and got confused

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): this is some cool recycle reduce but stay away is much superior",Awkward_King,,4,4,2021-05-28 21:35:59

This is overhated! Yes I gave this a 2! Ignore that! This is overhated. This would undoubtedly fair much better if the original Click simply never existed, because it was never gonna live up to it's big sister's reputation. I'm a big hyperpop and glitchpop and bleepblooppop advocate, but I do have to admit this one at times is just industrial sounding noises and differently pitched voices saying the word click over one another.

# The sequels are always better

**ggal2020** (11): no song will ever capture the feeling of quarantine better than this. it’s a dance party in your room, it’s dreaming about being around strangers and not caring, it’s missing your best friends every day. also it felt pretty special when I was in a zoom with 40 other angels and charli came in to play us a snippet of this song before it came out. and! fun fact this is the second rate I’ve given click an 11.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): clique

**bespectacIed** (10): This is indeed next level so legit

**bulforster** (10): the way every possible version of this song is a 10

**cremeebrulee** (10): people who hate this have no friends to miss

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): For those who don't get it, this is the sequel song to the fan-favorite track Click from the Charli album. Every time I go out with my friends late at night, Click plays in my head. That feeling that you are THE shit is something I never felt before and it was a glorious moment that boosted my confidence....until the pandemic happened. c2.0 definitely captured my feelings during quarantine when I cannot see my friends and I truly miss hanging out with them. I am so happy Charli did a follow-up song on Click that felt very timely during the first months of quarantine. It's definitely a track that evokes the feelings of missing going to the clubs with friends.

**iniekcja\_** (10): is it good because Click was good in 2019 or is it good because it's good? We shall never know

**nick1372** (10): I absolutely hated this at first but I listened closer and the lyrics really hit home for me. It’s been a year since I first heard this and I miss my friends just as fucking much

**Roxieloxie** (10): it could be the fact that im like extremely sad right now while im rating this album, but this is kinda hitting

**seanderlust** (10): the idea to take a song about having fun with your friends and sample it in a song about loneliness and isolation? talented brilliant amazing showstopping

**static\_int\_husp** (10): [hook] Clique (x96)

**welcome2thejam** (10): For some reason, my first time listening to this song was when the loneliness of the pandemic first really, well, clicked. So for better or worse, it's always gonna have that baggage. Good news is for now, it's a song that fucks me up in a good way. The build-up to and the moment of that first chorus coming in amidst the endless ""clique clique clique"" is incredible.

**fairytalehigh** (9.9): I MISS THEM I MISS THEM I MISS THEM ??

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): clique cliuqelc uqrlqkcurl cliurq cluiqlcliurlq cluirlq clique clkque clieuql clique clique clique

**bbfan132** (9.5): i love how dreamy/hazy the ending is

**camerinian** (9.5): actually had a mindblown moment on first listen of this. It's just so fun and so lovely

**amiriteor** (9.2): I MISS MY FRRIIIENENENNDNDNSDS

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): My favourite rendition of Click, I enjoy the idea of taking an already existing track, and reworking it for being stuck without your friends during the pandemic.

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): A marked improvement over click and a brilliant continuation of the thematic ideas especially in combination with the rest of the track.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): I'll never forget when this album came out and somebody posted a snippet of this to IG with the caption ""...y'all listen to this?"" and started a whole ass war

**celladonn** (9): Makes me wish i had friends to miss

**conceptualromance** (9): damn I miss my friends too :/

**engifear** (9): clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): recycle, reuse, and reducing queen

**Leixander** (9): This is better than Click tbh.

**ManofOranges** (9): A better version of click simply because it doesn't include that HORRENDOUS outro of the audio of a 10 car pile up.

**musical\_pyn** (9): c2.0 > c

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): took a while to click (pun not intended) but now ugh i love it

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): clique clique clique clique

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9): ; I already the love other versions of Click so the reinterpretation of it is so good.

**hakkerj** (8.8): I've shaken my ass to this so many times it just reminds me of May of 2020 when my life was OK

**jman457** (8.6): Click just sounds good no matter what version it is

**endcreditouilles** (8.5): the distorted synth in the beginning is so grating that if it was playing throughout the whole song it would be a 0 for me. But then she goes fucking OFF. This would be a 10 if the track started at 1:19

**plastichaxan** (8.5): the urge not to just comment ""clique clique clique clique clique clique"" so i'm commenting this instead

**runaway3212** (8.5): so much better than Click

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): omg she's talking about how she misses her....... clique :(

**steelstepladder** (8.5): A fantastic companion to c1.0

**Palutzel** (8.3): click is a masterpiece, this remix is not as good, but it still delivers

**vagenda** (8.3): The concept of this is more appealing to me than the experience of listening to it. It has some great sections but there’s also like a solid minute where you’re convinced you’re gonna be hearing “clicliclicliclicliclicliclicliclicliclic” for the rest of your life

**Alumineous** (8): I never want to hear ""clique"" AGAIN.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): The click Click CLICK part towards the end......is this what insanity feels like?

**ktajlili** (8): I get the hate because this is WEIRD. But it's also so fun and wholesome. I've never heard anything like it. It's a cool take on a classic Charli XCX song.

**Raxxin** (8): it clicks with me...

**shesdoingyoga** (8): Charli leaking the name of Grimes and Elon’s daughter

**SupremeShani** (8): If there's one thing I love about Charli, it's the way she pulls from and utilizes parts of her past discography for her shows and newer albums. The way she re-imagines Click here is so intriguing here, going from a guest-filled song filled with flashy bravado into a softer tune where she longs for her friends, her mind.

This isn't going to make any sense but the first ten seconds of this song make me think of Enchanted and then I can't enjoy the rest of the song, even if it was a song I liked, which it isn't, because I just want to watch Enchanted. I should go watch Enchanted. Anyway I'm so sorry kappy you through your 11 away on this but at least you weren't one of the people who threw it away on fucking Chosen Family.

# Would put down the ugly blouse they are holding and quietly bop to this if they heard it in a midwestern retail store

**kappyko** (11): it works

**NFLfreak98** (11): Put this drum track on any song and it’s instantly better

**thedoctordances1940** (11): There are probably quite a lot of songs in this rate that I would consider better songs, but ultimately nothing beats just how blissful this is. It definitely goes more indie than Carly ever dares to but this is just indie pop at it's finest, the driving drum beat, the little guitar lick and the absolutely bombastic chorus, I can only hope she decides to make more songs like it in future.

**bespectacIed** (10): Tweely Rae Tweensen. I love it. Carly and Molly of Alvvays need to do a 'great canadian platinum-blonde bob cut' indie pop collab

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this kinda sounds like a bleachers song but i really like bleacher songs

**endcreditouilles** (10): serving discovering-myself-on-a-cross-country-road-trip-realness

**hunnybee12** (10): bop bop bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is such a coffee shop song, but my inner white leaps out when this song is played

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (10): Every one of my Dedicated Side B reviews will include the word ""bop"", but of all the bops.....this one bops the hardest

**ManofOranges** (10): Very peppy-rom-com-with-main-characters-who-love-each-other-very-much-and-live-and-laugh-all-the-time-even-through-the-hard-times kind of deal.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this song just makes me so happy

**plastichaxan** (10): she's so smart putting the best song before the worst one to make this seem better

**Turpamutteri** (10): I never see anyone talking about this but it's always been one of my favorites on the album

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): A pretty fun song that's pretty climactic but not in the same way This Love Isn't Crazy is, still lovely instrumental and Carly sounds really happy on this one and sells it greatly.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Ok, guys, let's sort the whole thing out: CARLY RAE JEPSEN is the most underrated pop artist, for real. Why is everybody always sleeping on her?

**urfavgalpal** (9.4): serotonin straight into my veins from the moment this song starts.  Love this one.

**vagenda** (9.3): This song is a delicious slice of 80s movie mall montage fun and if you don’t like it you don’t like joy! That’s all there is to it!

**akanewasright** (9): ~~god I wish that were me...~~

**camerinian** (9): I need to be basically tripping on serotonin to enjoy this, but on the two days of the year when that happens this is fucking incredible

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is really cute! It’s got this kinda bratty ‘00s pop-punk energy to it but it also feels like something from an old musical

**KennyEarthman** (9): a Carly pop-rock album would be amazing

**Leixander** (9): THEN HE SAID

**liberalitea** (9): this a dancey bop i love it

**RandomHypnotica** (9): This is exactly the in your face, overly cheery pop I know and love Carly for, it's dreamy and soft, ""and he said, I LOVE YOU"" is so catchy, it's so much fun

**SupremeShani** (9): The whole vibe of the song is so sugary that it almost borderlines on cheesy, but I think that's what I love about Carly, because this is like pure serotonin injected into my brains. The drums and melody reminds me of some soundtrack to a cheap high school movie, and I mean that as a compliment.

**welcome2thejam** (9): A real ""sunny day car ride"" type of bop.

**welcometoNY** (9): can't wait for this to go out day one!

**cashewconstellation** (8.8): such a perfect song for a rom-com it gives me so much energy and it's so fun to sing along to

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): This is like the theme song to a really cheesy 80's romcom. I love it!

**hikkaru** (8.5): me when im sorting the whole thing out

**nick1372** (8.5): This one took a while to grow on me but the energy is infectious, especially in the chorus!

**notarobot3675** (8.5): this song is so cute!

**Dekubaku** (8.2): A sweet song. Rather teen and disney but in a good way.

**rickikardashian** (8.2): what romcom did carly write this song for

**wavingwolves** (8.1): this feels like music that would play in a christmas themed romcom during a dressing up montage

**Alumineous** (8): The hook is sonically childish and verbally repetitive. Plus, the song is 40 seconds longer than it should be. But... it's not average and I wouldn't skip it.

**bbfan132** (8): fun song, reminds me of a go-gos/bangles song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): So catchy it's almost annoying. Almost.

**cremeebrulee** (8): wtf idr this being so cute

**ggal2020** (8): society needs more teeny bob pop like this

**J\_Toe** (8): this sounds like a different sound for Carly. It's so quirky I love it!

**jman457** (8): Giving me a 2009 Jangle rock song and im here for it! (even though It can were its welcome really quickly)

**nooodisaster** (8): Cute vibes

**shesdoingyoga** (8): Nine year old me organizing my Pokémon cards in alphabetical order then rearranging them by Pokédex number

**vayyiqra** (8): Kind of a banger; I get the hype.

**juanolsen** (7.9): the chorus is annoying

**geraldinewww** (7.5): this is very cheese but sometimes i like cheese

**just\_thonking** (7.5): the verses are SO good and then the chorus... happens

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Fun song that rocks.

**throwaway7650** (7.5): this song is so bubblegum pop, feel like I'd hear this song in a magical girl anime or something

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.5): I cannot get over a comment I saw saying it sounds like the John Oliver theme

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): this is giving me commercial jingle but i mean that in a nice way, it’s fun!

**afs** (7): Carly trying out teen pop rock! Feels more like she's covering somebody from a decade ago, though.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): I can’t actually follow what’s supposed to be going on in the song lyrically but i like the drums.

**slimboyfriend** (7): This could definitely play in a JC Penney ad and I would still like it

**Vultuxe** (7): This track is very wholesome and dangerously close to rock-pop which is unique for Carly. Don't hate it, but don't love it.

**jasannn** (6): A little annoying and saccharine but that chorus is so catchy.

# Someone needs to sort this song out

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): I'm not sure how i feel about this...

**salivantsonority** (7.5): Song title describes how I feel about this record. Fun track though. Bit teen movie-y. Very uninspiring chorus without the meme potential of ""Store"".

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): it's fine, no real other feelings

**CarlieScion** (6.5): low-key feels like a kids song

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): the chorus brings it down, too chanty. I wish it had gone a bit more pop rock bc that's kinda the vibe I got from the verses

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): One of the most disappointing choruses I've ever heard, the fact that she repeats the same thing twice completely ruins the song for me. The song also could've gone so much harder

**1998tweety** (6): meh

**ktajlili** (6): I like this one at first but after a while it started to annoy me. It's just too sugary...

**runaway3212** (6): more annoying than good

**seanderlust** (6): target commercialcore

**fenellabeach** (5.5): how about let's sort this song out

**Uberpigeon** (5.5): this was teetering on the egde of cringe and i thought i liked it until the second verse

**AHSWeeknd** (5): late-90s rock influence in a Pop album???

**conceptualromance** (5): not this 2010s indie JCPenney commercial riff. I really can’t decide if I like it or hate it

**fairytalehigh** (5): the production in the chorus sounds like a jingle for a macy's holiday sale from 15 years ago in the WORST possible way

**frogaranaman** (5): actually I don’t want to do that anymore

**jayjaysortagay** (5): it sounds like the end credits song of a bad Netflix Original",Awkward_King,,3,3,2021-05-28 20:18:59

Creme, Hypno, I'm so sorry. For my own score and also this song's unfortunate placement jsdsjd. What I will say, is it is certainly the best song called 7 Years that I have heard!!

---

# my therapist says i love this song really bad

**cremeebrulee** (11): wish charli wasn’t in this rate so i can give my 11 to chloe x halle peacefully, BUT i still regret not giving official my 11 in the ama queens rate so part of this is to make up for it. but part of it is just really like these more introspective songs that charli does (see: thoughts, feb 2017, detonate etc). yes, maybe i am projecting a lot of personal feelings into a song with the lyrics “Without the Holy matrimony, I'm wife (I'm wife)” but idc. this song makes me wanna reach the level of comfort with a person that you only get after being with them for so long. anyway, i’m not gonna be surprised when this flops and i am still rooting for ungodly hour to win, but it just wouldn’t feel honest giving anything else my 11 when this is here

**targetguest** (11): one of my favorite Charli tracks of all time. Recently celebrated my 7 year anniversary with my fiancé and it's a super meaningful song to me

**akanewasright** (10): This just about melts my heart

**bespectacIed** (10): I say this on every rate with her in it: no one in pop music does introspective songs with punchy production better than charli. This is what she does best. See also: silver cross, next level charli, grins, emotional, party 4 u. God this song makes me feel everything

**Brendon-Urine** (10): that little part when the instrumental kinda backs out and she sings the chorus but it's so vulnerable and tender... hrrngghhhh

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): i kinda hate this but i like it like a lot lol

**Leixander** (10): the chorus is too infectious

**mudkip1** (10): fucking iconic

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This was SOOOOOO close to getting my 11. It's my most listened of the tracks on this rate, and my 4th most listened track of all time on last.fm. This is basically the Official of HIFN (and I LOVED Official), it's a celebration of Charli's relationship, and it's really nice to hear Charli being happy, and making a love song in the way she knows best. The punchy, sharp chords, the autotune on the chorus, it all just comes together so well, and I can listen to it forever and never get bored.

**runaway3212** (10): this song feels like a victory

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I almost gave this 9.7 for the meme but I’m too attached to it to not give a 10. It just makes me so happy for Charli. I’ve also been with my partner for 7 years (almost 8!) and I connect with the message of growing with someone through hard times, learning to communicate and becoming better for it.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): 1989 came out in 2014, which was 7 years ago, so 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is being released the same day as the rate reveal

**urfavgalpal** (10): My favorite Charli album is Number 1 Angel and this song really gives me elevated N1A vibes.  You just get such a vibrant image of her relationship with this song and it really fits into the theme of this stretch of the album.

**wavingwolves** (10): this makes me want a relationship so i hate it

**zagreux** (10): I love how corny this is

**Palutzel** (9.8): if this had another chorus, it would be perfect. I cannot stress enough how good the production is

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9.5): ; the shock I was in to find out Charli has been in a relationship for 7 years

**plastichaxan** (9.3): i underrated this for a while, and while it's not the best song here it's amazing still

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): It really says something about hifn that this is one of the weakest songs, but it's still every bit as bright and industrial as I would love it.

**amiriteor** (9): what if i was in love

**camerinian** (9): CYOOT

**KennyEarthman** (9): is it just me or the chorus sounds like Porsche's pre-chorus

**liberalitea** (9): underrated but i think it's great

**nootnoot781** (9): flop, lukas graham outsold with ease (but in all seriousness this is such a cute love song ??)

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): speaking of crying but now in a slightly happier way

**sirpancakeXI** (9): Deserve to be a hit instead of the one by lukas graham

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): charli always uses vocal effects so well, but this song is such a serve with them

**waluigiest** (9): the harmonies are so correct

**hakkerj** (8.9): This beat stays stuck in my head on repeat

**bbfan132** (8.5): you're exactly really really my type

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): a really sweet love song, love the more vulnerable charli tracks

**pig-serpent** (8): Digital harmonies will force me to add 2 or 3 points to any song.

**thedoctordances1940** (8): cute bop

**thegraygh0st** (8): im wife

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8): Better than the straight version

**Dekubaku** (7.7): It's right there in the name.

**jman457** (7.7): The xcx production about love really goes well together

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): The sleeping pill line and the chorus throw me off. Still a good song, though.

**cashewconstellation** (7.4): quite good! not amazing but almost on Claws's level

**ManofOranges** (7): Any song named 7 Years is guaranteed to outsold Lukas Graham simply by existing.

**musical\_pyn** (7): I really hate the fact I'm giving this a 7

# Lukas Graham stans

**bulforster** (8.8): Those 2nd verse lyrics... maybe the d'amelio comparisons are justified... whatever, the rest is super cute

**UselessTacooo** (8.1): one of the weakest links here, but still worthy

**juanolsen** (8): a little forgettable, but good overall

**nick1372** (8): I really like the writing on this one but it’s missing something and I can’t put my finger on what

**Oberionsynth** (8): I love how she sampled the pans from ""I don't get no sleep cause of y'all"", ugh her mind

**nooodisaster** (7.5): I mean this is the nicest way possible, this definitely sounds like a song about a 7 year relationship.

**salivantsonority** (7.5): Really like the vocals on this track even though the melody doesn't enthuse me that much.

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): ew this made me think of lukas graham

**CrimsonROSET** (7): one for every year in their relationship, good for her honestly

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): Lukas Graham who?

**notarobot3675** (7): really enjoyed this! haven't got much else to say about it. production felt a little cleaner, but overall just a really nice Charli track.

**rickikardashian** (7): years

**skargardin** (7): 7 Years

**vayyiqra** (7): Charli XCX, 2013: ""Ha! We on some husband and wife shit"". Charli XCX, 2020: ""I'm wife""

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I swear this is my actual score I’m not trying to be memey… the instrumentation reminds me of Closer… but in a good way

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (6.5): sweet song! Really repetitive with the with really really stud but I found the flight lyric with the sleeping pills clever.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): what percentage of these comments will be Lukas Graham jokes

**afs** (6): if I didn't know what hyperpop was and I heard this, I'd immediately understand why it's called that.

**AHSWeeknd** (6): ENUNCIATE SIS

**brenda\_official** (6): the lyrics...charli miss girl

**iniekcja\_** (6): the chorus is the only redeeming quality

**Itsafudgingstick** (6): I don’t know why this song has never done it for me tbh. That being said I was sooo tempted to give this song a 7; but I really can’t give filler (to me) higher than a 6 justifiably

**jasannn** (6): The only thing I can ever remember from this song is ""swish"".

**pat-rickstar** (6): I'll give it a positive score for the production but these lyrics need some work

**seanderlust** (6): eh this is the first one off the album I could take or leave. it's not bad, but it's just fine

**1998tweety** (5): i wanted to give this a 7 to match the title but unfortunately it was not good enough for that, dont really care for her vocal delivery but there are some cute bits.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): There's not really much of a hook here.

Is it ethically wrong to bust it down to a song that includes a voicenote of the artist in therapy? Is it morally questionable to fucking pop it to a song about torturing yourself by loving somebody too much? Is it fucking rude that the shitpost I wanted to use that was a two minute video demonstrating why Bowser is actually a very good father didn't work because you cannot add child friendly videos to playlists with non child friendly videos in it? The answer to one of these questions is yes.

# Baby you're my best-ie-ie

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Which British soap did she sample in this?

**Alumineous** (10): Charli needs all the 10s from me. The production is gorgeous. I love the meaning of this song. It's very related to Bad Friend, in a way.

**bespectacIed** (10): god this is excellent..

**conceptualromance** (10): idk this one just sounds soooo good to me

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): fun song about being paranoid about your significant other and intimacy as whole. Reminds me of the Hedgehog’s Dilemma hence the ten lol.

**fadedblue09** (10): Probably my favorite on the album? For some reason I am really sold on the songs where Charli contemplates on her relationships

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorite Charli songs, I love how she sings about vulnerability on here and how hard it can be open to someone you are close to without having their fear of losing the person and becoming emotionally wrecked after getting close.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the catchiest song on the record for me, she makes the inherent danger in getting close to someone so appealing

**seeyanever** (10): Can you find something wrong with this? Lyrically? Gorge. Vocally? Gorge. The sound choices? Gorge.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Lovers to Enemies, Or Is It?, Angst, Character Study, Songfic, Canon Compliant, 354 words

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Every time I do a rate there is usually one song per album that I realize I’ve been sleeping on, and for this it is this one

**fairytalehigh** (9.3): ""it hurts here, it like HURTS here"" i know girl i knowwww

**UselessTacooo** (9.2): MAYBE YOUR MA ENEMYYYY

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Think this is one of Charli's better vocal performances, love the post-chorus to this as well

**afs** (9): 80s synths, my saviour, comes to boost my hopes, yet it's so unmistakeably Charli.

**akanewasright** (9): I love the three track stretch from detonate to IFU, and this is the best of the lot. Just three songs about how much quarantining with a significant other just kinda sucks, and this is the one that feels the truest for some reason.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): oh this is a fun song! I like this one! I do!

**ReallyCreative** (9): GIVE ME THOSE STARCRAFT TERRAN THEME GUITARS!!!! Additional supply depots required for this slay!

**seanderlust** (9): shaking my ass to a song containing a recording of the artist talking to her therapist

**juanolsen** (8.8): i loved the concept behind this track and i think it's well executed

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): I don't know how I feel about the literal clip from Charli's therapy session, but the rest of the song is nice enough

**urfavgalpal** (8.6): my least favorite of my favorite tracks on this album but I still quite love it and I think it’s so integral to the narrative this section of the album tells.  It’s one of those songs I maybe don’t love as much on its own but I think is the most brilliant thing in the context of the album.  Like that voice note at the end where she says she finally understands and then it kicks into high gear and goes to I finally understand?  Brilliant.  And I think it’s great for right after detonate cause it’s like she detonated and now she’s having these self-doubts and all that.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): I trust people too easily so I cannot process over a possibility that a future boyfriend of mine could be an enemy. ??

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): one of my early standouts

**ggal2020** (8.2): every time something bad happens to me I say “it hurts here, it hurts. yeah.” in my head

**wavingwolves** (8.1): my biggest enemy is me pop a 911

**bbfan132** (8): probably my least favorite track on hifn but it’s still good, nice production

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is a really cool lyrical concept.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): maybe the true enemy were the friends we made along the way? I’ll get back to you on this one

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I love how this song is so chill but still has that Charli vibe. Not a big fan of the chorus though.

**musical\_pyn** (8): one of my favorites from the album

**vayyiqra** (8): 80s as hell which is Good

**plastichaxan** (7.8): in the words of detox: ""i ain't saying it's the best but it ain't the worst"" (in this rate)

**hakkerj** (7.7): The chorus solidifies this song for me, probably my least favorite on the album though

**geraldinewww** (7.6): charli spending her quarantine writing songs for her 160k work enemies to lovers fic huh

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.5): ok I hate spoken bits of songs in the middle of a song (babes spending too much time with Matty Healy :/ ) but the chorus is a straight banger

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): the hook is reallyy catchy. i love it

**cashewconstellation** (7.4): good, i like it, almost as much as to add it to my liked songs

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): probably the most “pop” friendly track on HIFN, but even though this is less experimental its one of the strongest songs here

**1998tweety** (7): cute

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): Outtro here is great

**NotWith10000Men** (7): cute bop! The effects on her voice work better on this song

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): i love the vibes, i love how homegrown it is, i just wish it was a bit bigger. i feel like there was room for this song to explode into animal collective level chaos and it just doesn't. but it's so good!

# Enemies of XCXheads

**amiriteor** (7): eh

**hikkaru** (7): girl who asked for your monologue

**jasannn** (7): Alexa play My Nemesis from Phineas and Ferb.

**nick1372** (7): this one kinda gets lost in the album but it’s a really cool and unique concept

**runaway3212** (7): I like this song, but I feel like the theme has been done better on this album

**salivantsonority** (7): Bit forgettable.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): i just hate spoken parts in songs

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i feel like i'd really like this if there was a little extra oomph somewhere

**throwaway7650** (7): nice chorus, song feels kind of slow though

**wasian-invasion** (7): damn she really took the whole music as therapy concept and made it therapy as music

**camerinian** (6.5): I don't actually return to this one as much sssshhhh don't tell the comment section of my writeup

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6.5): A nice slower song from Charli but nothing super groundbreaking

**KennyEarthman** (6): kinda wished it picked up tho, not a fan of slower hyperpop

**nooodisaster** (6): I appreciate how personal the track is to her but it's not my fav.

**skargardin** (6): cute lyrics but it's kinda whelming

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): the instrumental sounds like the music that plays on Forensic Files when it returns from commercial break

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The intro got me really hyped for an epic, Kiss It Better-esque power ballad, but sadly the rest of the track did not live up to my presumptions...

**jman457** (5.9): this song kind of bores me ngl

**cremeebrulee** (5): i used to really dislike this and its still my least favorite on hifn, but i’ve come around to not giving this a 0. i appreciate the story behind it but i also wouldn’t miss it if it were cut from the album.

**frogaranaman** (5): really wasn’t my favorite single during the rollout and hearing it in the context of the album did nothing for the song

**mudkip1** (5): ah, a typical charli mid album track

**Oberionsynth** (5): i'll be honest i just listened to this song and i can't even remember it enough to rate it

**Vultuxe** (5): Enemy falls under the same category as a few other songs on this record where the hook does not click with me and the lyrics are subpar with little to say about them other than I guess this is fine.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Charli made an enemy when she released *Pop 2*… it was me

**liberalitea** (4): this is pretty boring sonically compared to rest of the album and the sample is unnecessary imo

**SupremeShani** (4): Maybe we all are our enemies.

Okay let me get something off my chest, this is a great song. I've been a CxH fan since sometime in 2019 when i discovered The Kids Are Alright (and I have an ungodly amount of streams of it as an album (vote mine and Creme's r&b girl debuts/mixtapes next cycle xx)), and this was the first song released as a promo single for the album. It didn't exactly make any major moves, which I get, but it really holds up as a song. Swae does a great job on the song, the three of them riff of one another's vocals amazingly and honestly, you know why this is first out? Misandry. Halle singing ""you wanna talk bout me what about you"" is HEAVENLY, and *at least* raises this song from above a 0 on it's own.

---

# Misandrists

**bespectacIed** (8): this was fun, idc. but i understand the haters lol. CxH is above this havana rehash

**juanolsen** (7.9): it is my least favorite song from the album, i would leave swae lee out of it

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): This isn't a BAD song by any means, it's just not particularly memorable, it's just very generic

**Alumineous** (7): The features didn't add much to the song. Just a low point of the album.

**Oberionsynth** (7): points off for reminding me straight people are out there

**Palutzel** (6.9): TW MEN

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): blehh m*n

**afs** (6): I thought it was Juice WRLD at first... it's alright, nothing special here.

**bbfan132** (6): this could’ve been cut lol

**CrimsonROSET** (6): no i do not want to see ‘you cha cha’

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): Hmm...I usually like Swae Lee but he isn't give me much in this song. This is probably my least favorite song in the album because it doesn't stand out to me very much. This is very far from 0 material tho so I guess that's something.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): This one used to be a banger for me. I still like the beat a lot, but the chorus is a bit boring.

**jayjaysortagay** (6): it's giving filler

**ktajlili** (6): It has cool groove, but I think the features overwhelm the song and make it feel out of place in the track list

**pat-rickstar** (6): This has grown on me a bit but it's still bottom 1 of the album

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): Should have been a bonus track, it just doesn't fit at all. but that doesn't make it a bad song, just bad for this album which is largely more mature than this sound and lyricism.

**xaviersi** (6): in a perfect album about women and the female perspective they decided to include a man bleh

**jman457** (5.9): I really like CxH vocals on this but there is too much male energy on this

**jasannn** (5.5): This song really wasn't needed at all. It has some of the most boring and generic production here and adds an unnecessary feature to the album. But it's okay, I guess..

**liberalitea** (5.5): this feels slightly out of place on this album sonically? but it's still a fun song, but i wouldn't play this as much.

**notarobot3675** (5.5): this song is nice, very chill, but i think out of the entire album its the least interesting track for me. its very much a song ive heard a LOT over the last few years.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (5): the worst song of all of these

**Brendon-Urine** (5): it's not bad... but it's definitely not good

**celladonn** (5): The most forgettable song on the album

**EnCaine** (5): the only truly meh song on this record imo. just pretty forgettable

**frogaranaman** (5): I mean it’s okay

**iniekcja\_** (5): I hate Swae Lee on tropical style beats, this is no exception

**KennyEarthman** (5): the girls' vocals snapped, wish this was a solo song

**nick1372** (5): don’t like how the production overwhelms their vocals, especially on the chorus. Not sure if I don’t like the mixing or just the beat itself. It’s just distracting, especially with swae’s vocals added in.

**racloves** (5): don’t really care about the feature tbh I just want cxh

**throwaway7650** (5): chloe and halle's vocals are nice as always but this is definitely the worst song on ungodly hour

**Uberpigeon** (5): its fine

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Such a drop in quality from the first half of the album...

**Vromega** (5): I dont like collabs. The music chemistry doesn't work here imo

**WhyDoIExistXD** (5): An abomination why does it exist

**oscarbrierley1** (4.5): it's fine ig but it doesn't fit on the album

**camerinian** (4): nothing personal against this song, it's just that most shitty New Zealand pop has this exact production style of bad plucked guitar and basic trap beat, so this just innately revolts me.

**engifear** (4): No men allowed

**hakkerj** (4): To me, this song is not on the album

**Itsafudgingstick** (4): Oh god I just don’t like this song lmao? I think part of it is that I’ve never listened to Ungodly Hour except as an entire album in one sitting, and this track comes after a steady stream of perfect or near perfect tracks that it feels like such a letdown. It works as a palate cleanser for the backend of the album at least I guess.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): Swae could have been left off tbh

**plastichaxan** (3.5): m*n ruining yet another song...we hate to see it

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): Swae Lee needs to read the title track and Catch Up to the girls because this track is a trainwreck with the complete lack of energy

**LostintheCosmicFire** (3): sorry, it's soo misplaced here

**sirpancakeXI** (3): swae lee's voice is just annoying to me at this point. i don't want to be rude but i don't see myself ever enjoying a song with him in, which sucks because chloe and halle did great here, but the feature just completely turned me off.

**steelstepladder** (3): why those tats do that

**Vultuxe** (3): Once again, there is nothing that holds my attention in this one.

**fenellabeach** (2.5): the features don't work for me

**pig-serpent** (2): I hate more or less everything MikeWill touches, so I was expecting this song to sound like total ass, but most of the production here is actually fine (I hate the drums but beside that) but Swae Lee is uncharacteristically annoying and everything about this song is just boring. Completely dreadful.

**joeeswift** (1): I do not enjoy swae's voice

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): I downloaded the full album last year but deleted this song almost immediately, so I had basically forgotten it existed lol. Feels wrong to give my zero to my second favorite album in the rate but this sucks so bad I gotta speak my truth.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (0): fuck the person who made that weird Spotify art with Chloe and Halle tattooed on Swae Lee? Gives me weird misogyny, as if cXh didn’t save this mediocre song smh. Also it does not go with the rest of the album

I have always been a fan of the theory that this is the other side of the Want You In My Room coin, and while it evidently uhhh hasn't reached the same rate heights that song has, it's cute! It's cute!

---

# A nice cross-breeze through the house

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): I really like this kind of style of music that's kind of swingy? Guitary? Really not sure but it has some funk underlying within it, and Carly really nails this kind of song with the kind of 'I'll be your girl' lyrics.

**anothertown** (10): as the only Vulfpeck fan on this webforum i’m obligated to give this a 10

**CrimsonROSET** (10): SO. UNDERRATED. The windows of time by the song kinda buffering? Iconic!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I love this song idc idc idc

**joeeswift** (10): Carly's best song....like ever

**ManofOranges** (10): The way she says keep a window for me and then the song has ""windows"" of sort in the sound where there's nothing to kind of sonically suggest a window, ugh her mind.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): i love this. what a targetcore bop. what an absolute hmm i need new curtains jam. what a banger to listen to as you spend 900 dollars on dollar section items. what an absolute BOPPER to get a JC Penney's haircut to.

**Roxieloxie** (10): okay so this is like boneless wyimr, the bones in question being mister jackoffs. but honestly all this is reminding me of is how i thought the line in WYIMR was 'slide onto my window and i thought they were just fucking against a window'

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I love the way everything cuts out during the chorus

**targetguest** (10): it's new, it's fun, it grooves

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I'll always keep a window open for this song. I love the bass and the way she pronounces ""bo-dy"" in the chorus. She sounds so cute!

**KennyEarthman** (9): cafe music

**wasian-invasion** (9): love the instruments and little start/stops on this

**jman457** (8.9): a grooooovy jam, with some fantastic production. Feels forward thinking for her while nostalgic.

**juanolsen** (8.7): i love the production of the song and how it goes perfectly well with the concept

**vagenda** (8.6): It’s cute but I’m mad that the shared bridge basically means that Carly chose this over Disco Darling when Disco Darling is SO MUCH BETTER

**akanewasright** (8.5): This and Let’s Sort The Whole Thing Out belong in different scenes of the same teen-rom-com

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): imagine you're lying on your bed minding your business and then suddenly carly rae jepsen CLIMBS through your window and cries ""YOU KEPT THE WINDOW OPEN FOR ME."" just imagine

**nick1372** (8.5): If we keep the yonic metaphor from want you in my room then this song becomes INCREDIBLY lesbian and I think that’s just neat

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): this is a really cute proof-of-concept, harking back to Carly's Tug of War sound and pulling it off pretty well. It's not super impressive or memorable outside of that though.

**TiltControls** (8.5): fun bop!

**Vultuxe** (8.5): My first impression of Window was tragic, but it grew on me? It's just an enjoyable song, the lyrics aren't special but damnit if I don't love Carly's voice especially compared to the first song.

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8.5): Tug of war tease

**savemeaseat143** (8.3): the other side of WYIMR

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**fadedblue09** (8): Cute percussion-driven song. Hope she hones this sound more in the future.

**jasannn** (8): TAKE MY EYES TO BORROWWWW

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): A perfectly sensible bop

**Palutzel** (8): cute bop

**sirpancakeXI** (8): finally grow on me after a whole year

**Dekubaku** (7.8): A bit 2010's, IMO. But it remains rather fun.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.7): I feel like there’s an effect on this song that doesn’t sound great on my phone but otherwise very fun and summery. The abrupt stops were interesting

**urfavgalpal** (7.7): One of my more favorite songs on this album but not my most favorites.  I like how it’s a little bit more laid back and I think Carly’s ability to really make you feel shines here.  This is I think my favorite song on this album to have come on while I’m cooking because it’s a little more lowkey.

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): she’s cute

**bbfan132** (7.5): fun but i wish it had a bit more energy/dynamism

**cashewconstellation** (7.5): a chill bop

**frogaranaman** (7): very cute

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): I like this one, it’s very cute lyrically and the sparseness of the production works for the vibe it’s going for

# Shut the window shut the fucking window now it's freezing in here

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): I had this at 9-10 originally, but then the listening party happened.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This song is okay but I think it suffers because there isn’t really a difference between the verses and the chorus? Like the minimalist Motown thing works to get me pumped up but then it amounts to nothing so the song just feels flat.

**Leixander** (7): Disco Darling should've been here Carly!!!

**musical\_pyn** (7): very much a side b track

**notarobot3675** (7): love the vulfpeck inspiration! although tbh after hearing disco darlings... this song just doesn't hit like it used to. disco darling is so good and i just... donut understand the need for the change lmao

**Oberionsynth** (7): this song would be so much better with a different vocalist ngl, something about carly's voice just doesn't hit right for me (not saying she's bad, just not my taste)

**pig-serpent** (7): A fairly basic bass guitar driven song. It's certainly a good song, but not anything special.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): It's quite cute but feels more like a b-side than any other song here

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): slide on through my window!!! anyway i like this but Disco Darling is so much better so why wasn’t the bridge used on that instead

**geraldinewww** (6.5): you were the one you were the one you were the one

**afs** (6): didn't really expect the funk at all, and it's not bad! But that abrupt stop in the beginning of the chorus keeps throwing me off.

**AHSWeeknd** (6): A skip

**bespectacIed** (6): I like the preppy late 2000s indie ghorl vibe. But it is as cute as it is cloying

**conceptualromance** (6): I have no excuse, I just don’t like what’s happening here

**ignitethephoenix** (6): yep this is definitely a b side

**RandomHypnotica** (6): Why does this have the same rhythm as Selena Gomez & The Scene's iconic Who Says

**SmileAndTears** (6): Wow I just realized she used the ""You were the one, you were the one And I need your love."" line and now I'm just wondering why I'm not listening to Disco Darling instead

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): it's not bad it's just kinda boring

**throwaway7650** (6): definitely my least favorite on this album, it somehow feels slow

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The pauses in this song are very disorienting lol

**Vromega** (6): lacks lyricism, melody, construction. The different elements of this song do not match each other. Exception the nice ""you are the one"" with the background vocals.

**waluigiest** (6): Want You In My Room Side B

**welcome2thejam** (6): Well, Carly does give me her eyes to borrow after not letting me keep mine in I Really Like You, so I guess that's a plus.

**plastichaxan** (5.8): this is kind of forgettable

**Alumineous** (5): Skip!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Cute but basic.

**nooodisaster** (5): a cute midtempo song that I never willingly listen to

**NotWith10000Men** (5): I like the plunky noise.

**pat-rickstar** (5): Doesn’t really go anywhere

**runaway3212** (5): this is a c side song

**salivantsonority** (5): I'm bored, Carly. Wouldn't keep the window open for this song.

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): Welp the momentum just stops after This Love Isn't Crazy

The intro to this sounds kinda video game esque right? I'm not crazy in thinking that??? It sounds like the Mario pipe noise. Anyway, this song grew on me massively, I think I had it as a 1 or a 2 when I was first accepting ballots and have gradually upped it as I've kept bopping to it. It's cheesy as fuck, but that's Carly and I think you have to embrace it at the end of the day. Disappointed it is out day 1 but I also think I am in part responsible looking at my score so I guess I can't be too sad :grinny:

---

# Know what falling in love is 'sposed to feel like

**Leixander** (11): Love at first listen, everything is just perfect here.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): the chorus on this is soo catchy

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is from the 80s. No one can tell me otherwise.

**EnCaine** (10): i dont know music production at all but the kind of squishy(?? help me please i dont know how to describe it) bass that's on this song instantly makes me like anything. song would still be good even without it

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of my favorite songs in the whole rate, counterpoint of this kind isn’t something we hear in pop music a lot so I can only attribute this to Carly’s musical theatre side jumping out. It helps that both melodies are really good and actually have something to say about each other too

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): I love how bouncy and summery this is

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song is so fucking HAPPY!!!!!!

**jasannn** (10): that outro is amazing

**jman457** (10): Both Vibey and Anthemic, a perfect pop song

**runaway3212** (10): this layering is great

**waluigiest** (10): okay yeah this is the naive, smitten, horny Carly I know and love

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): The bridge and last chorus are so good

**endcreditouilles** (9.7): big road trip vibes

**cashewconstellation** (9.6): a BOP, the ""i like to give as good as i get (GOOD AS I GET)"" always makes me scream

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): the last minute of this song absolutely transcends

**Alumineous** (9): The hook gets a bit repetitive, but otherwise, it's a good track.

**artzpop** (9): The bridge makes me go crazy stupid aaahh

**bbfan132** (9): such an infectious song, love the production

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The production in this so good. I am glad she included this in the B-side album.

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): God I am such a heaux for a good ass synth backing, also WHO exactly is saying these things miss Carly?

**jaztinax** (9): i feel like this would go well with june gloom by allie x as a mashup... can someone try

**notarobot3675** (9): one of my says on this album

**RandomHypnotica** (9): This is a highlight from either version of Dedicated, it's bouncy, fun and fresh.

**vagenda** (8.7): The lone survivor of the Disco Sweat era that escaped Carly’s backyard and blessed us all with its sublime boppery

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): super interesting pop track

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): A classic CRJ bop.

**frogaranaman** (8): that synth is godsend but the chorus could be a bit ‘more’

**IIIHenryIII** (8): A 10, this is what this song would have gotten hadn't the chorus been overshadowed by the verses and the bridge.

**ManofOranges** (8): Me telling my friend what people say behind their back.

**nick1372** (8): The hook is a bit too wordy for my taste, but I like the sentiment

**savemeaseat143** (8): the last 30 seconds saves it

**throwaway7650** (8): the chorus is so addicting

**Vromega** (8): This chorus stays in my mind during hours and it annoys me. THIS IS WHAT THEY SAY

**1998tweety** (7.5): something is missing but shes cute

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): ""I like to give as good as I get""?? Vers pegging queen confirmed

**wavingwolves** (7.4): i'm disappointed about the fact she's singing ''delicate'' instead of ''dedicated'' in this

**afs** (7): Lots and lots of 90s videogame sounds here.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): We say......bop

**NotWith10000Men** (7): okay this one is a little bit of a bop. I like the chanty aspect of the chorus.

**Oberionsynth** (7): girly singing over the pacman soundtrack

**poptartchill** (7): I like it but it has soft choreo vibes

**KennyEarthman** (6): I love the video game-y synths

# Fuckin losers

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I’m too cynical and lonely for this

**amiriteor** (7.2): GIRL we fucking get it you wrote the same song 3 times

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Kind of a forgettable track in this one but it's not bad at all. Like the backing vocals but it's just hard to make this one stand out especially amongst a rather homogenous tracklist.

**conceptualromance** (7): I like the vocals at the beginning of the bridge a lot. Overall I don’t think the song quite works, though

**juanolsen** (7): a little bit forgettable and bland

**Qustomar** (7): This song is alright but what it brings to the table that a lot of other Dedicated Side B songs don't for me is ENERGY.

**hakkerj** (6.9): This song is SO weird. Every time I listen to it I always want more from it though

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): i would’ve expected this to be more quotable given the title but its so forgettable

**liberalitea** (6.5): this is overwhelmingly decent

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6.5): No one says that, but yes

**Vultuxe** (6.5): I always felt like this was a filler track, though it contains everything that could make a top tier Carly song. Still, it just doesn't click the right way as much as it should.

**urfavgalpal** (6.4): Ive had times where I really enjoyed this song and times when I find it to be very boring and I was listening over and over again trying to figure out what it was and then I realized that I like this song when I am cooking or otherwise not paying attention to the song and am casually singing along but I don’t like actively listening to it.  I like bits and pieces of this song, specifically I like Carly’s delivery of the lyrics.  I do not like the instrumentals very much though and I find them kind of boring.

**jayjaysortagay** (6): it's giving me budget Kylie

**musical\_pyn** (6): the end is good but I don't know if I'm willing to listen to the rest to get there all the time

**seanderlust** (6): i really don't like the harmony on ""falling in loove's supposed to feel like""

**SmileAndTears** (6): Idk man this is too sugary for me

**thedoctordances1940** (6): eh

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I think this song is the epitome of my issues with this album: the music sound amazing, but the lyrics are all kinda... lacking

**nooodisaster** (5.5): The bridge is interesting but nothing else is.

**SupremeShani** (5.5): I absolutely love the way she delivers the ""got me feeling confident"" line, and the fact that she accurately portrays the feeling of falling in love with this song by being just as disappointing.

**salivantsonority** (5.3): The melody's just a bit strange to me.

**Stryxen** (5): Gayle: I haven't heard any of my gay friends use this phrase. Oprah: I've never heard this from any gay person, no.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): meh

**cremeebrulee** (4): this is what they say falling asleep is supposed to feel like

**CrimsonROSET** (4): If this is what it feels like, maybe I’m better off alone.

**fairytalehigh** (4): if this is what they say falling in love's supposed to feel like... YIKES

**welcometoNY** (4): i really just can't get into this one. it's frustrating because the verses are great and then the chorus is such a letdown.

**zagreux** (3): the 'feels like, feels like' after she says this is what they say falling in love is supposed to feel like is very annoying and unecessary

**fadedblue09** (2.5): Sounds really tired and lifeless.

**akanewasright** (0): I used to have a 2 for this song, because I genuinely find it dull as hell and grating at the same time. But I gave it a bonus point because the “got me feeling dedicated” line in the first verse was cute. After hearing that she’s singing something else there, I feel straight up betrayed. Learning that one of the things I liked was... not a thing sent me over the edge.

**pig-serpent** (0): A weird slowed down synthwave song meant to have a feel good summer vibe and fairly ok melodies. I hate the weird choppy synths on this one.",Awkward_King,,2,2,2021-05-28 20:42:17

Believe it or not, this is my favourite Rina song. This is probably one of my favourite songs point blank, I find it so addictive to replay, and if the bonus songs were included in the main rate, honestly my 11 decision would've been between this and ringtone, none of the main songs would have been in the picture. I still maintain this would have served as a great interlude between XS and STFU! if it were included in the regular tracklisting, as it tackles themes similar to XS in worker exploitation and existing in the working class, while also leading perfectly into STFU! with the literal screaming outro. Pretty heartbroken for it to be out day 1 ngl, and for it to complete the 1-2-3 of Rina going out straight away, but at least it was pretty unanimously the best of the three hahaha

# Workers' rights!

**akanewasright** (10): this fucks idc

**amiriteor** (10): I'M A CAPITALIST almost my 11......

**skargardin** (10): are we ready for the conversation of this being a ten?

**geraldinewww** (9.9): why yes rina i do like to party

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): This is cute, it sounds almost like a HOLYCHILD track, very bratpop

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9): low key awful, but i love it

**fairytalehigh** (9): in my 2020 pop girl headcanon ""bees & honey"" is the name of the cereal that triggers charli's anxiety attack in ""anthems"" and this is its jingle. i need therapy

**frogaranaman** (9): wtf why is this fully fleshed out idea and well executed song shorter than three minutes and thirty seconds to four minutes and fifteen seconds, this is absolutely unacceptable and I demand that song be longer. the streaming era has ruined song lengths

**hakkerj** (9): it would be a 10 if it were 90 seconds longer

**runaway3212** (9): honey is overrated but this song is good

**SupremeShani** (9): i actually would love to see this developed into a longer song, i guess rina said you can have more anti capitalism, and it even ends with distorted screaming this time

**TiltControls** (9): buzz buzz

**notarobot3675** (8.9): the chorus goes off

**bbfan132** (8.5): short but fun as hell

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): This is low-key giving me M.I.A. teas.

**jman457** (8.2): my favs from the extended version of the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): So is overconsumption good or bad Rina, which is it?

**lolcevan** (8): THIS SONG IS TOO FUCKING SHORT!!!!!! ??

**LostintheCosmicFire** (8): SAME RINA I'm broke too

**plastichaxan** (8): too short

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): Very very catchy, but the lyrics are a bit weaker than some of her other tracks

**vayyiqra** (8): Got some extra points for being incredibly silly but making it work somehow.

**welcome2thejam** (8): An extra point for that insane last 20 seconds or so

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): My parents never gave me the talk and that’s why I’m gay

**throwaway7650** (7.5): overhated, I say as this song is tied for my lowest bonus rate score (so technically it's the worst song in the bonus rate for me?)

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): is this vaguely anti-capitalism? Kinda hard to tell

**urfavgalpal** (7.2): when this one hits it really hits and when it doesn’t it really misses.

**wavingwolves** (7.2): why isn't this longer :(

**afs** (7): There's SO much going on in this sub 2 minute track, and before you know it it's over.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I really thought there was a Beyoncé Party sample

# Fuck the working class

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): one of those songs where I like what its about more than I actually like hearing it

**ggal2020** (6): I think I can safely say it’s a good thing none of the bonus tracks were on the main album. here for the anti-capitalism though.

**musical\_pyn** (6): incredible hook but not much else

**Oberionsynth** (6): I beez in the trap

**pig-serpent** (6): lol

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): what did i just say rina. this is a mark ronson track. in the year 2020, you made a 2003 mark ronson track. you should be ashamed of yourself. and go listen to early mark ronson if you haven't, it's so bad it's good.

**thedoctordances1940** (6): A little bit annoying

**iniekcja\_** (5.5): this is cluttered, and I love cluttered, but this is cluttered in a bad way

**pat-rickstar** (5): It's meh, the outro is weird. There must have been better unreleased tracks to put on the deluxe

**fadedblue09** (4): Kinda embarrassing

**jsonphile** (4): sorry rina I love you but this ain’t it

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): This song is a bit too much metal and not enough pop for me to enjoy...

**1998tweety** (3): no

**Vultuxe** (3): The hell is this lol. Why did we have to end on this

**Alumineous** (2): Wow. This is shit. This is Rina's Monday Blues. I'm also thinking Birthday by Selena Gomez, and I also don't like that song.

**cashewconstellation** (1): why did she have to do that

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1): This sounds like a song the antagonist band in a Disney Channel Original Movie would sing

**IIIHenryIII** (1): What's with the male voice on this? Let me get back to the actual album to wash my ears.

**waluigiest** (1): she REALLY knew which songs to cut from the standard album

WHY DID ALL OF YOU HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE IS SAYING POTTY 4 U WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?????

---

# I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna throw potties

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Hard not to love this song from how oddly sentimental it is in how Charli pours her love out so openly, love how the instrumental swells at the end.

**bespectacIed** (10): Still jawdroppingly beautiful. Magnum opus type of song. Best song on album tied with 7 years

**Brendon-Urine** (10): the only grower for me from this album. I thought it was meh at first but it just clicked out of nowhere for me and it's stunning. The charli choir? EXCUSE ME?

**cremeebrulee** (10): this the clit of the album

**ggal2020** (10): as a hardcore angel, the process of this release was incredible. the parody lyrics about umru being on lanaboards, the “leaked” backing track on her sub, the come to my party fakeout. so iconic. what a moment in angel history.

**hunnybee12** (10): it's definitely a grower but i love it now it's so hopelessly romantic and sweet

**iniekcja\_** (10): true romance ??????

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): For a song with party in the title, this is such a mellow track; adding this to my sad rave playlist

**ManofOranges** (10): Kind of catchy!

**nooodisaster** (10): YOU COULD WATCH ME PULL UP ON YOUR BODY LIKE ITS SUMMER-- Look, this song is just such a serve. The narrative is so clear, the emotions so poignant, the bop so severe. ""Why you treating me like someone that you never loved?"" still hits like a bag of sand.

**nootnoot781** (10): why is it still sending me that people thought this would be a repackaged “come to my party”

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Another VERY close contender for my 11. The idea of throwing a party for someone, and they don't even show up, or rather, the fear that they won't, is heartbreaking, and the track does a fantastic job at conveying that. The instrumental being the party happening in the background, people having fun, but Charli can't focus on anything but wanting that one person to walk through the door, for them to be here, to be with them and to see that Charli appreciates them. She's trying to dance and party, but her mind is only thinking of one thing.

**runaway3212** (10): I'm so happy she released this it's literally so great, also we need the host to play 'come to my party' after this

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): this is soo sweet

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.9): sad twerk intensifies

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): party on you party on you pottyonu partyonu

**bbfan132** (9.5): the intro and outro are both gorgeous

**conceptualromance** (9.5): gatsby moment

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): I find it interesting how two of these albums transition from track 9 to track 10 by including crowd cheering sounds like a live show

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.5): Definitely my favorite song on the album! So raw and emotional and I love the lyrics on this one even if they are trademark Charli repetitive. The intro still makes me a bit sad and reminds me of last summer

**fenellabeach** (9.3): luxe

**jman457** (9.3): This albums track 10

**hakkerj** (9.2): She wrote this song for me after I had my quarantine Animal Crossing birthday party.

**1998tweety** (9): this is actually really good wtf, i kept getting scared that it would go batshit at a point but thankfully it didnt

**AHSWeeknd** (9): she raps??

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I almost cried when this started playing… I was like finally… a song… thank you mother Charli

**liberalitea** (9): come to my party was the better of the party songs on xcx world but this is still great

**pig-serpent** (9): Maybe a little too repetitive, but it is catchy as all heck and there's plenty of instrumental variety. Also there's an extended callback to Next Level Charli, and that's cool because Next Level Charli rules.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): the layered vocals, the harmonies, the effects, the all of it. great song!

**Qustomar** (9): The cheering at the end makes me sad :,

**wasian-invasion** (9): aww this just exudes complete love

**juanolsen** (8.8): cute

**amiriteor** (8.5): I hope she'll be a fool - that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.

**Leixander** (8.5): potty4u

**salivantsonority** (8.5): A nice, earnest track. I want to see a lip sync to this track, especially the long passages where she doesn't take a breath.

**seanderlust** (8.5): party on, garth! party on, wayne!

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): I think I’m going to stop giving reasons now

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): wtf I love The Great Gatsby now

**bigbigbee** (8): The instrumental to this sounds like Zelda dungeon music, but from the handheld games where there isn’t unique music in each dungeon. Anyway I like that, so

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I want to go to this party but also the idea of it kind of scares me.

**cashewconstellation** (8): i didn't like it at first but then it grew on me, very good

**Dekubaku** (8): Not what I was expecting from a song called Party 4 u. Plus, 8 is a party 4 2.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): It's quite fascinating that this song was actually made even before the concept of the album even existed. The fact that this was a scrap from Number 1 Angel and Pop 2, only for this to be brought back for this album is so cool. This 2017-ish song fits well into this album mostly made of songs in 2020 and I can definitely see this making it to the top 20 at least.

**fadedblue09** (8): Sounds really empty in the first few minutes, but I love how intimate this sounds.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I actually like this. My opinion on this track changes every time I listen to it.

**Oberionsynth** (8): boom clap girl tryna get clapped anthem

**savemeaseat143** (8): ok gatsby

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i can't work out whether i love this song bc it starts strong, then goes downhill, then comes strong again

**TiltControls** (8): this was going to be like a 3 or 4, but that ending bridge is a solid 10. she could have had maybe cut down on the number of the party on you's in the song and it'd be solid

**vayyiqra** (8): someone find that meme of Charli as a doge that says I just want to go parties :(

**akanewasright** (7.8): I’ll never forget how this was leaked on r/XCXheads by (we think? I forget if there was confirmation) Charli herself. That’s just fucking awesome. I’m glad this song is finally out and released, but... I can’t pretend that this is my favorite charli song. Still, I like it a good amount

**bulforster** (7.8): I like this but you can tell it wasn't written for this album.

**fairytalehigh** (7.6): i like this song, but stuck between ""i finally understand""/""c2.0"" and ""anthems""/""visions,"" i can't help but feel it sticks out too much

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): ever since I heard ""potty on you"" I can't hear anything else

**Roxieloxie** (7.4): Me when i turned 17 and invited 3 friends out to lunch and they stood me up lmao

**jasannn** (7.2): wtf does ""party on you"" mean

**afs** (7): I understand why she chose a loop for her visualiser.

**EnCaine** (7): a decent track with one part in particular i really really live for (youcouldwatchmepulluponyourbodylikeitssummertakemyclothesoffinthewateretc)

**J\_Toe** (7): iirc this song was written a while ago, but the themes just match the intimate feeling of the album so well (i only threw this party for you, because we share a house and share a social bubble and i can't invite anyone else)

**ktajlili** (7): I have mixed feelings about this song. It's a well-written and emotionally impactful song, but I dislike her singing style because I think she sounds a bit like a baby. The ending sounds like POTTY ON YOU. POTTY ON YOU. sorry I can't help it but Charli's still a queen.

**shhhneak** (7): this should’ve been the last song on the album. That outro!

**Vultuxe** (7): When she leaked a snippet of this to r/xcxheads... people lost their goddamn minds, and rightfully so -- that snippet was ear candy. Unfortunately, the studio release changed it up (the interlude/breakdown is not the same) so it ended up being a letdown to me somewhat. Still, it's a decent song.",Awkward_King,,2,2,2021-05-28 21:16:44

and introducing my co-host for this singular song...

**Roxieloxie** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG. Im not even joking when i say that if this was in the main rate it would be my 11, i literally am obsessed with this song. Its not on spotify and im tired of spotify deleting my local files every time i try to add it. this song came out and i litterally had a day where i looped it on youtube for an hour straight while i danced around my room and took pictures and im not even joking when i say that was one of my best summer moments from lockdown (last summers version). like how can you hate this song???? its so perfect and fun i want to be in the world that this song creates its pure serotonin, miss jepson i am begging you to put this song on streaming because it makes me so happy. Like truly just no thoughts just fun summery vibes. ON THE ROAD FOR HALF THE YEAR AND REAL LOVES JUST A SONG I GUESS I AND I FEEL LIKE THAT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT YOU, OR SOMETHING ABOUT ME

/u/nevergonnasaythat has flagged up an Italian language article in the Huffington Post ([Link](https://www.huffingtonpost.it/entry/aprite-i-magazzini-delle-aziende-stanno-entrando-250-navi-rischio-ingorgo-di-merci-in-arrivo-da-asia-e-america_it_5e7deb37c5b6cb9dc19e6cd1)): Open the warehouses of the companies, 250 ships are arriving. Where do we put the goods?

Translation by them:

Confetra, the Italian Confederation of logistics and transport companies, is asking the Italian Government and the Ministry of Economic development to keep warehouses open to avoid a logistics collapse as factories and companies are closed. For days the companies’ associations have been asking the Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to clarify the provisions of the Presidential Decree from March 22nd ordering to stop all non essential production activities.

“In the next 15 days 250 ships are scheduled to arrive in the 54 commercial ports in Italy. It is foreseeable that around half of the tons of goods that are arriving (which departed their Country of origin much before March 23) will find that the industries that were supposed to receive them are now closed. Where shall we put these goods?”, is what Ivano Russo, Director General of Confetra, is asking, in an interview with Huffington Post. “Shall we leave the goods in the ports? This will block the infrastructures and operational activities in the ports. If we do not deliver the goods to the warehouses of production industries and if we do not empty these containers, we will not have enough empty containers to take care of the other ordinary transports of goods. The containers are filled-in, emptied out, and filled-in again for other transport trips. We cannot afford leaving thousands of full containers left lying somewhere, and anyways as of today there is no place where they could be left.”

This is a serious issue, and it comes in a context where certain companies are already unable to withdraw the goods they ordered because they are short of cashflow: the stocks of goods that are not being collected lead to overcrowded areas and therefore make it impossible for arriving ships to unload their goods.

The problem of imported goods overflows to goods that are to be exported: “We are lacking containers for goods to be exported, so food products that are to be exported remain in the warehouses of the food production companies, which will soon be congested”: this is the testimony of a delivery firm working on Naples and Salerno (Southern Italy).

Fedespedi (association of Italian international delivery companies) remarks that the concurring effect of production being stopped in our Country and production starting again in China is threatening to fill up logistics hub in national ports and airports in a short amount of time and thus produce costs which will be charged to the goods, the companies and the economic operators.

Fedespedi adds: “A clarification (about the Presidential decree) is essential to guarantee the logistics workers to be able to deliver and pick up goods which have arrived or have been already produced and are ready for shipping, both nationally and internationally”, also considering that in these days are arriving in Italian ports ships that have left South America and Asia much before the stop of production in Italy. The warehouse activity, as defined by Ateco Codes, is included among activities that are considered essential by the Government in the current lockdown phase. But the warehouses of logistics operators could very soon be filled up with the goods that are arriving from abroad if those goods won’t be rapidly shipped to clients: their clients being those activities that for the most part are now closed but do have their own warehouses or storage areas. The decree from March 25 from the Ministry of Economic Development orders the closure of all non essential activities by March 28, including shipping of stocked good. But it does not say anything about incoming goods, that are arriving due to orders that had been placed earlier.

Here are some figures that allow to better understand what we are talking about. Italy moves 11 million containers every year, 800 thousand every month, 200 thousand every week. Ships from South America taken around 20 days to arrive, ships from China take around 42 days to arrive. There are orders of goods and raw materials that involve hundred of thousands of containers that have been placed way beyond a month ago and that will arrive into Italian ports in the next weeks: the companies that ordered them are closed. “Where do we put this stuff?” is what logistics companies are asking. Ports are already under stress. Yesterday there was a meeting, that participants referred to as “positive”, between the presidents of the Port Authorities and the minister of Transport Paola de Micheli. The Minister asked the presidents of Port Authorities to contribute to elaborate measures to guarantee the operational activities of ports and the sea, and proposed for the Port Authorities to actually develop and promote a plan to relaunch the sector”.

The world of transports has received, as per its request to the Ministry of transports, the guidelines that have avoided blocking an entire chain whose importance has never been understood as much as in this period. Mr. Russo adds: “The Ministry has done everything to guarantee the continuity and the operational activities of logistics and goods transports industry. Now we are highlighting an issue that is not of interest to certain categories, but is an issue related to general functioning of the system”.

Other providers in this sector are also highlighting difficulties. Confitarma, association of ship owners, asked the Government to provide “first and urgent measures of extraordinary support to the shipping industry”, such as an exceptional intervention to support the income of maritime workers, a one-year extension of the exemption of paying retirement pensions contributions and also loans up to 3 years. Assarmatori, another association of ship owners, asked the Government to proclaim the natural calamity for naval transports, and extension to naval companies of the Fund that was allowed to Airline companies: “The maritime passenger transport income has in fact dropped to zero, but the companies keep guaranteeing transport connections not to interrupt the supply of vital goods. But companies in this sector are sliding to the point of no return. And it is not possible to ask these companies to sustain the cost of guaranteeing these services without appropriate support from the State”.

The ports are also asking for help. Feport, association of terminal port operators, launched an appeal to the European Comission and to the member States: “It is urgent for members States to supply an appropriate support to avoid disorders in the UE chain supplies, as well as devastating economic effects that would cause a significant loss of jobs”.",Fwoggie2,,29,29,2020-03-30 11:29:30

I may be able to provide some insight as I am an expat in Shanghai. I followed the outbreak in Wuhan as just something I saw on the news before quickly flying back to the UK following a change in FCO advice in regards to China and landed back in China just as it got bad in the UK. I was really lucky actually as I came back just before China introduced extremely strict quarantine procedures for foreign arrivals and have just finished my 14 days of self-quarantine.

While I won't comment on the infected numbers in China (I don't know much outside of my compound), I can say that schools are beginning to be opened up as soon as this ~~month~~ April\*. It seems like April is the time to open up. NAIS (Nord Anglia International School) in Pudong (like one half of Shanghai) is opening up at the end of April.

Compared to the UK and the overall reaction of the Chinese gov towards the virus everything I've shows a pretty relaxed atmosphere among residents that stayed here during the last couple of months. All of the amenities have been handled/catered for and many people have relied on Chinese delivery companies. (Mind you this is all from my experiences walking around my compound when I do quick trips to throw out the rubbish). In fact, I have seen several residents actually not even wearing their masks properly (not covering their noses, having it half down so they can talk on the phone, etc) which is quite surprising.

I also believe that things are normalising which suggests that the gov is not seeing the coronavirus as a persistent threat given their overhanded response earlier this year. Its actually quite astonishing to see half the world go in lockdown but for China to be going back to business. My own personal thoughts on this are that after seeing the potential economic devastation of shutting down for months China has prioritised their economic goals. Now while this may be heartless I also believe that the gov has weighed up the potential of a future outbreak actually being that detrimental to society. The amount of temperature testing that goes on just about everywhere you go suggests to me that any potential outbreak would be identified quickly and hopefully before it could spread. This may be a model for our own countries down the line as long term lockdown is unsustainable and more importantly, everything I understand about this (which isn't a lot) suggests we will see small outbreaks frequently over the next few years.

Hope this helps.

So this is a crap article. He didn't die because he was denied treatment, he died because he was taken to an Urgent Care. Urgent Care are offices, often in office parks, where you can see a doctor without an appointment. They are not emergency facilities, many don't even have x-ray equipment. Most people go to them when they or their kid has a cold/fever. 

Urgent Care /= ER/A&E. They are for non-life threatening illnesses only. They could not have provided the care he needed no matter what. At best they could call him an ambulance.

flwzzu1,t3_frouh5,"My Wedding, on May 23rd, was cancelled by the temple since they are currently closed worldwide. We had planned to go to the courthouse on April 9th to get the marriage license, it is currently only open M/W/F for 3 hours a day but the website says they expect to return to normal on the 7th. If we can still get the marriage license that day, since she'll be travelling from 2 states away and I have to take the day off given the idiotic government hours, we'll probably just get married civilly that night. She's a high school teacher and they are online-only until at least the end of April so worst case she just has to go back for 2-3 weeks in May but we are both hoping her school goes internet only for rest of the school year and then she'd only have to go back to hand in her laptop at the end of the school year and she could get another carload of stuff from her parents. 

Saw a (shopify I think) website selling cloth masks today, far from n95 but it looks like small businesses are popping up now outside of Etsy making masks. I ordered a 3-pack to see the build quality and in the event that my state, or the country, goes masks mandatory in public (I have a very full beard and shall not be shaving soooo yeah).

* It's not a post attacking Matsumoto, Downtown or NTV. I just put the controversial cases and rumours here. This case has no villains. Matsumoto did a lot of mistakes, and NTV too. I still think Matsumoto a genius man (although not being my favorite comedian) and NTV is one of my fav Japanese TV stations along to NHK and TBS.
* Don't give hate to Tanaka just because he didn't seemed sad because of No Laughing pause. He's not obligated to love to receive a lot of hits and Thai Kicks and lost the chance of appearing at Kohaku doing what he loves most: skits
* I've noticed these types of posts gets many downvotes because it's a sad topic, but I need to spread the full context of this case.
* Honestly I think that No Laughing paused for many reasons: pandemic, BPO, Matsumoto and NTV bad relationship and specially their ages

NTV didn't knew what they were doing and 99% of the comedians of the cast are low talented. Just popular for any reason. But not funny.

I'm sad that you feel that way. I'm a big fan of the comedians in that picture especially Okamura and Ninety Nine duo, as well as bananaman etc. Some of them are regular-ish guests on Gaki as well

1) Gaki staff are getting old, as op mentioned Yamachans post about age. This was one of the things I was thinking about why batsus started changing throughout the years. For example, first batsus were very harsh on the cast, not letting them sleep. After that, that wasnt on batsus anymore.                          
2) We are living in an era that is changing socially fast, like SUPER fast (or at least thats how we perceive it right now). A lot of things that socially/morally were fine before, are not anymore and I guess is just how society works in the end. A lot of people might think that its just the stupid ""wokeism"" working here and ""ruining"" everything, but thats not the truth. I made a post long a go, discussing how come Hamada always harassed women and was kept on the episodes. There is the lipsinc were Tanaka is singing and Hamada rushes to lift a dancers skirt (#1380 4th Lip-sync Song Show) or on his trial how it shows him groping boobs from a fellow comedian.",adanteria,,4,4,2022-08-16 20:37:15

# Dedicated Side B

---

**Overall Average**: 7.571 **// Average Controversy:** 1.816

---

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.358): better than Dedicated

**IIIHenryIII** (9.333): This is actually the album that turned me into a Carly stan. Before its release, I really liked her and listened to a lot of her songs; however, I was not super invested in her music and her in general. Oh man, how I regret it! She is the definition of the word perfection. To the people who say that, NoboDy iS PerFEct, Carly and Taylor say hi! I would literally give a 10 to almost all the tracks, but I don't know if this is allowed.

**nick1372** (8.833): This is Carly Rae’s least consistent, most underwritten, least focused, most hastily produced project since Kiss (and maybe even since Tug of War), but it’s still fantastic because it’s a Carly Rae Jepsen album. I appreciate that she tries some new things here and still sticks to other classic Carly techniques. If you were underwhelmed on the first listen, I’d really suggest listening again with no expectations. This is really a solid album. It doesn’t have the best songs on the rate but will probably end up with the highest score from me because all the songs are just so easy to listen to.

**mudkip1** (8.750): wtf why is this better than i remember it being

**just\_thonking** (8.708): First and foremost, I am a Carly Rae Jepsen stan

**vayyiqra** (8.667): I have to be blunt, when this album dropped I wasn't excited for it. I like Dedicated, but after streaming it once I more or less forgot about this album. However I am an 80s synthpop apologist so Carly cannot miss when she's in this genre. Like everything she does, this is a fun and cute album. It isn't anything more than that, and it doesn't need to be. I love Carly because she makes fun pop that makes me happy, and that's what I want right now.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.567): I was expecting that I would feel underwhelmed by this album considering that the rest of the albums in the rate are way stronger contenders. On top of it, I haven't heard the main Dedicated album in full yet so I felt like I might have missed some context when listening to this album. It's not the case at all as this album can be enjoyed as a standalone body of work. Actually, listening to this album reminded me why I loved Carly's music in the first place. There is a bit of EMOTION sparkled in this album mixed with Carly's more mature perspective on life and romance. Now I am really curious to listen to Dedicated if I get the time because I really loved this B-side album so much.

**moooo566** (8.500): It's no EMOTION (but neither is anything else), and the version we got is missing Let's Be Friends, my favourite of her 2020 offerings, but overall it's really good. I'm kind of surprised at how high I've ended up rating it, actually.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.500): POP PERFECTION, but some of the enunciation in this is questionable.

**pheromenos** (8.500): actually a very decent and sonically cohesive album. i admittedly found it boring upon its release, but it has since grown on me a lot.

**iniekcja\_** (8.417): the truth is I had never really gotten into Carly's discography before this rate (which is blasphemous in a sense I guess), but I really really enjoy this one and I find it much much better than the original Dedicated

**zagreux** (8.417): Carly Rae Jepsen makes the same songs about the same topic over and over again. And I keep putting a goddamn mark to all of them. Over and Over again.

**wasian-invasion** (8.292): This didn’t pack the same punch as emotion side b, which I come back to almost as much as side a. A few great songs & ideas in here, but the rest feels pretty fillery. I can see this getting chromatica-ed pretty hard in the rate.

**TiltControls** (8.292): Not a memorable album but it is a great collection of songs, though Side B > Side A imo

**shhhneak** (8.275): It’s not the feat that Emotion Side B was and it really showcases how consistent Dedicated is sonically but literally any collection that Carly drops is a good day.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.250): CRJ follows up her solid discography with a selection of Dedicated leftovers of which half should have honestly made the actual tracklisting and been given some extra oomf. Unfortunately this record displays a crucial flaw with CRJ's music in that it's really kind of the same flavour, and while good, really leaves the diversity she had shown to be capable of on EMOTION a lot lacking. Not a bad release at all either, though.

**conceptualromance** (8.250): I don’t know why she felt the need to do this

**notarobot3675** (8.242): when your bsides album is better than what most pop stars put out officially >>>> yeah what is there to say but like... a genuinely really solid pop album and its not even a proper album! love that for me

**wavingwolves** (8.117): better than dedicated :noitstrue:

**Alumineous** (8.083): I do have to say: I NEVER listened to Dedicated Side A other than the sexy song, No Drug Like Me. So, I have no context for how these fit in the Dedicated chronology. Taking that into account, I have to say: Carly impressed me. Her vocals were quite impressive, and she clearly occupies a lane of pop that is actually unique and fun to listen to. This rate didn't make me a full-on fan of her, but I'm glad to have experienced her ""world"", so to speak.

**skargardin** (8.083): For being B sides these are some darn solid songs.

**Roxieloxie** (8.067): why did you all lie to me and tell me this album was bad

**kirby31200** (8.042): While not quite an instant classic like her previous work, this is a very solid, likeable, enjoyable pop album

**Vultuxe** (8.000): I ended up liking this album a lot than I did on release. Sure, it's a collection of songs and not a true album I guess, but most of them are enjoyable and worthy additions to her discography.

**welcometoNY** (8.000): honestly i think this album is a lot better than side a. it has the best song of the bunch (comeback) and none of the clunky lows (for sure, party for one, everything he needs). i get that it feels more like a collection of songs than an album, but since a rate is literally rating individual songs there's no reason for it to do as poorly as it inevitably will.

**jasannn** (8.000): It doesn't have the high highs of Side A, like Julien and WYIMR, but its a lot more consistent project.

**sirpancakeXI** (7.958): my average completely plummeted with the last two song, it could have been a much higher average without them

**poptartchill** (7.958): I understand why these songs didn't make it into Dedicated (my favorite Carly album). That being said, it's Carly, so they're still good. I don't love this as an album but it is a great collection of songs.

**hakkerj** (7.942): I love Emotion Side D

**SmileAndTears** (7.908): ""Side A"" if I can call it that is one of my favourite pop albums ever so of course

**nooodisaster** (7.833): popheads will praise a random artist for saying they like carly rae jepsen more than they'll praise carly rae jepsen

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (7.833): This record was actually better than I remember it being. It came out, I was excited, and then I more or less promptly forgot about it. While this is still a pretty average record, my average is something like 7.8 if I did my math right, it is still better than I remember it being. Maybe I'll come back to it more often, but I'll probably just forget it exists again.

**jman457** (7.825): I feel Like i remember this being a lot more forgettable and justifying the B-side names when I listen to it a year ago. But listening too it now its like a whole new album.

**ReallyCreative** (7.758): Is it better than Dedicated? No. Does it have songs that are better than most of what's on Dedicated? Yes. Is it going to get butchered? Probably. Am I that mad about it? Well, let's see where Stay Away places and I'll get back to you.

**plastichaxan** (7.683): this would be perfect as an EP is all i’m saying

**jsonphile** (7.667): well not really much to say about this album, or any songs in particular. Just a handful of pretty fun songs that obviously aren’t going to be her best songs or they would’ve ended up on the actual album. But even Carly’s throwaway songs are still pretty solid

**anothertown** (7.583): It’s not even giving what y’all said it’s supposed to gave

**Palutzel** (7.550): cute album, but definitely weaker than other Carly projects and the other albums in the rate

**pat-rickstar** (7.542): This ended up getting a higher average than I expected, and at the end of the day these are pretty good songs considering they're leftovers. Still my least favourite in the rate unfortunately

**thedoctordances1940** (7.500): It's a good album overall, but it's not very consistent. There's some very clear filler and the closer is really quite bad, but there are also some really high highs, Let's Sort The Whole Thing Out is one of my favourite songs released last year and Solo is also pretty damn great. I'd say I prefer it a little bit to Dedicated, because while the tracks that are very similar to the ones on dedicated aren't quite as good and definitely feel like B-sides, the songs are a bit more over the top pop and probably wouldn't fit on Dedicated stylistically are mainly far better than what's actually on that album.

**hikkaru** (10): maybe my fave on the album tbh it's so fun

**Leixander** (10): when i mishear the first line as ""it's not a cock"", then they go on to rhyme that line later with the word cock...

**ManofOranges** (10): Take away one letter and all of a sudden this song is about the job I had at the local olive garden for two months.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song is brutal. it is a brutal ripping into fuck boy behavior, and if this song had existed about six years ago, i could have avoided some mistakes. such as fucking grown men with the names of power rangers. anywhos. i love the bass in this song. it's so vibey even as it's clearly about a painful experience.

# cock

**ReallyCreative** (10): slut shaming men is my favorite hobby

**Roxieloxie** (10): BUSY BOY BUSY BOY BUSY BUSY BUSY BOY

**targetguest** (10): my go-to for the album

**urfavgalpal** (10): this one comes on and I just like my body starts involuntarily dancing I have to.  Really there isn’t much to say about their songs because their voices are so good.

**waluigiest** (10): the Instagram live where they explain the censored line is “it’s 4 oclock / you’re sending me too many pictures of your JUNK” always sends me

**fairytalehigh** (9.8): i like to think they giggle because he has an ugly dick

**Stryxen** (9.5): me when i have to do a single task in a day

**bulforster** (9.2): Okay but she definitely says ""9 o'cock"" right??

**iniekcja\_** (9): was it 4 AM or PM though? Cause that changes many things

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): Okay but this song is personal to me because I’ve definitely been the Chloe/Halle in this situation before, unlike them though I def fell to the busy boy’s charms dsfkdsf. Also that fucking giggle with “You sending me too many pictures of your…” is sending meeee; this song is nothing but 10/10 drags

**jaztinax** (9): the “it’s 4 o’clock, you’re sending me too many pictures of your (chuckle)” sends me every time

**astrologicalangel** (8.5): this is fucking hilarious

**bbfan132** (8.5): the second verse is excellent lmao

# cock

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This song is unrealistic… imagine having the option of being with Chloe or Halle and then you trifle with them. I can’t suspend my disbelief like that.

**juanolsen** (8.5): i don't have much to say about this song, but I really like it for some reason

**salivantsonority** (8.5): The Partition of this record. S'cute. Love the bubble noises.

**TiltControls** (8.5): hey busy boy

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): Whewwww this one is so good too. Their vocal arrangements and quality really shine on this one and the lyrics are so deliciously cutting

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8.5): ""Sending me too many pictures of your chuckle""

**notarobot3675** (8.4): okay its been a minute since ive relistened to this song and i forgot how much fun it was, thanks to this rate for reintroducing me

**hakkerj** (8.3): Haha can’t say the c word!

**EnCaine** (8): i wonder what he was sending pictures of

**engifear** (8): Let CxH say… well, actually can I even say it?

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): As a busy busy boy myself, I feel very called out

**musical\_pyn** (8): bussy bussy boy, bussy boy

**nooodisaster** (8): They way they smack down these boys in such a classy way is just... chef's kiss.

**Oberionsynth** (8): not this boy sending them dick pics, why are the girls on grindr omg

**Uberpigeon** (8): unsolicited dick pic anthem

**wasian-invasion** (8): busy boy you stay on my mind fulfill my fantasy

**zagreux** (8): https://azealia-banks.fandom.com/wiki/Bussy_Boy_(product)

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): men suck wbk. For some reason although this bops it’s never clicked with me compared to the other songs on here.

**wavingwolves** (7.8): i love the adlibs on the second chorus soooo much but i wish the chorus itself was something more

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop, love the production

**pheromenos** (7.5): itsy bitsy boy

**Raykel** (7.5): pissy pissy boy pissy boy pissy pissy boy

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): This song is so Destiny's Child/early Beyoncé

**cashewconstellation** (7.4): groovy! i dig it!

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): This kind of starts the downward trend of the album, I do like the lyrics and the instrumental but it doesn't feel like the songwriting and production are as watertight as the beginning few tracks (minus Tipsy).

**Brendon-Urine** (7): busy doesn't sound like a word anymore

**CrimsonROSET** (7): if you STAY busy you don’t gotta GET busy

**fadedblue09** (7): Dips into filler territory. I don't really like songs too fixated on m*n.

**frogaranaman** (7): SAY COCK, BE BRAVE AND SAY IT

**jackisboredtoday** (7): the amount of times I’ve mistakenly read this title as bussy boy… :(

**KennyEarthman** (7): lmao queens of censoring cock

**ktajlili** (7): this lyrics are a lot but it's fun.

**poptartchill** (7): this one has been more of a grower

**rickikardashian** (7): bussy boy

**jsonphile** (6.5): weakest song on the album. “Busy boy busy busy boy” is just not that interesting of a hook. That said, the worst CxH song is still a decent song so good for them

# cock

**runaway3212** (6.5): the dick joke here is lazy

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): busybusyboybusyboybusybusyboy

**Vultuxe** (6.5): Filler. Doesn't stick out to me, don't hate, don't love it, won't want to go out of my way to hear it again. To me, as soon as one of their vocals or production miss, their songs devolve into being very generic and derivative pop-trap.

**jman457** (6.2): its catchy but seems very cliche lyric wise

**afs** (6): Getting big TLC and Destiny's Child vibes from this one. Also gets a little too repetitive.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): You'll never get deep inside. Ouch! I swear I can hear Beyoncé's voice by the end. I'm still not a fan of it.

**vagenda** (5): This song is just kinda annoying! Sorry!

**Vromega** (5): repetitive and boring

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (4): ok this is nice but a little slow and kinda forgettable on this particular album",Awkward_King,,9,9,2021-05-29 20:31:43

Okay yes the memes of Carly saying the f slur at the beginning of this send, but I really love the song too. We *really* need to do away with the whole aBolIsH sHoRt SoNgS thing, not every song has to be exactly three minutes and thirty seconds and that is okay. Some songs, like this, and Bees & Honey, benefit from being shorter and not overstaying their welcome at risk of being repetitive. This is the perfect bite-sized bop, and perfect to replay!

# Comments to do with [spawning](https://assets.sainsburys-groceries.co.uk/gol/7656442/1/640x640.jpg)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): He was born in Vegas

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Unspawn me.

**endcreditouilles** (10): spotting WHO???? Carly knows her audience, good for her

**KennyEarthman** (10): I thought she said the f-word in the opening

**Leixander** (10): Stop spawnkilling us Carly

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): although it sounds like she's saying spotted 'f-words' in the first line and i cannot hear past that. ok her and ari need to go to the same training for just saying the word 'vegas' with extra emPHAsis on the correct syllABLE.

**rosecoloreds** (10): for calling me a slur in the beginning

**runaway3212** (10): the f slur is 'fake mona lisa'

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the intro have the same energy as ariana saying vegas let me hear you make some noise

**welcometoNY** (10): literally a crime for this to be so short. also something something spawning *******

**buddhacharm** (9.5): SPRAWLING FLAGGOTS

**nootnoot781** (9.5): carly! ?? you can’t say that word!!

**racloves** (9.5): I just love this song, it’s just fun. Maybe it’s cause she definitely says a different word at the start lmao

**pheromenos** (9.3): born in vegas let me hear y'all make some noise

**1998tweety** (9): spotting f@ggots

**EnCaine** (9): i haven't listened to this since it came out and i got tricked by the opening lyric AGAIN AAAAA

**just\_thonking** (9): the first line will never not sound like ""spawning f****ts""

**mudkip1** (9): spawning f*ggots

**seanderlust** (9): ...???...OHH she said Vegas. got it.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Carly can say it it’s ok

**SupremeShani** (9): Let's get this out of the way, she absolutely said the word, sorry, I don't take criticism. Seriously though, I strangely really love this song for some reason upon re-listening to it. I don't know if it's a warped guitar line or some distorted synth, but the instrumental intrigues me, and the way the pace switches up between the verses and chorus is fun.

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): queen of spawning gays

**vagenda** (8.7): I know Carly doesn’t actually say the F-word in this…….but she could

**juanolsen** (8.6): i love to hear Carly calling me f@ggot

**celladonn** (8.5): How many comments are going to be about that misheard first line

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EUjMo0ZXkAEsQ-D.jpg

**hikkaru** (8.5): spawning f-----s

**nooodisaster** (8.5): ""spawning f****ts"" You know what, she has a point.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): I love this track to bits, but I don't know how not a single person on her team didn't think ""Born in Vegas"" sounded like something else...

**liberalitea** (8): omg i thought she said the f word when the song started and i was like damn that's bold considering your fanbase. anyways underrated bop

**nick1372** (8): I know every other person here is gonna make a spawing f****** joke but I hear it every single goddamn time

**rickikardashian** (8): pop girls are saying “vegas” like that on purpose now, you cant convince me otherwise

**salivantsonority** (8): Qual qual qual.

**skargardin** (8): You can't convince me that she does not say the f slur in the first line

**thedoctordances1940** (8): spawning what now miss carly?

**Uberpigeon** (8): did she just say the f slur?? this is cute though i like the little sounds

**Palutzel** (7.9): ""spawning fa***ts""

**bbfan132** (7.5): spawning what now….

**engifear** (7.5): Haha Carly said the f slur

**fairytalehigh** (7.2): how many [REDACTED] can you spot spotting ""spotting [REDACTED]""

**NecroDolphinn** (7.2): The opening line is very easy to confuse for something alot worse than it is and also I wish this song was longer

**akanewasright** (7): When I ban Carly from phcj OMG

**CrimsonROSET** (7): what did she call me

**geraldinewww** (7): still cannot unhear her saying a slur as the second word of the song. carly...

**wasian-invasion** (7): idk what these lyrics mean and im too tired to try to understand

**plastichaxan** (6.8): inb4 everyone misheard vegas for… y'know

**Oberionsynth** (6): I need to get my hearing checked bc i definitely thought carly casually dropped the f slur at the start of this fdjsfiosdjofisj ""v*gas, let me hear y'all make some noise!""

**shhhneak** (6): “Spawning ??” is what this rate is currently doing.

**wavingwolves** (5.4): this one will spark some ppl's humiliation kink i think

**bespectacIed** (2): Petition to ban pop girls from saying the word Vegas

# comments not about carly saying a slur

**Vultuxe** (11): The production and melody here are strikingly polished. It's addicting. An immediate standout on this record and dare I say her discography.

**cremeebrulee** (10): the way this is the best song on DSB and its basically an interlude i hate it here

**targetguest** (10): huge contender for my 11. it's amazing. lost out because of the length

**welcome2thejam** (10): Redd can't keep getting away with this! But yeah, love the slinky and sexy vibe it's putting out, don't know if I love the short runtime but at least it makes hitting replay a lot less painless.

**zagreux** (10): horny carly is the best carly

**cashewconstellation** (9.8): i am taking some points out cause CARLY DID YOU REALLY HAVE TO MAKE THIS SONG TWO MINUTES LONG

**kirby31200** (9.5): The worst thing about this song is that there isn't more of it

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): THE ONLY REASON THIS ISN'T A 10 IS BECAUSE IT IS SOMEHOW SHORTER THAN MY DICK

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): true ARTPOP

**Turpamutteri** (9.5): cute

**Alumineous** (9): Carly Rae, this is TOO DAMN SHORT.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Oh Carly is freaky I see. This feels like a deep-cut from EMOTION repurposed to fit for Dedicated. I love this.

**pat-rickstar** (9): Too short, that’s my only issue with this

**ReallyCreative** (9): My working theory is that this song is underdeveloped because it was supposed to have a feature of some kind. I still thoroughly enjoy it, but it is flawed due to its length and feeling of missing something.

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): Needs to be longer

**urfavgalpal** (8.7): god I love to sing this song.  It’s got some quirkiness to it that I really dig

**camerinian** (8.5): the smoothness of the lyrics are so undercut by this awkward ass production but I'm kinda digging the contradiction

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): one of my favorites on the album for sure

**jasannn** (8.5): This song has so much potential and would've been amazing if it had a bridge but it sounds great within in its short run time.

**afs** (8): This track would fit right into E•MO•TION, which is a very good thing. But what's with the early end? Would have gotten 9 otherwise.

**frogaranaman** (8): that synth is so cute

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): Would be higher if not too short! Just a bop-tease

**musical\_pyn** (8): really great but just too short for me to fully get invested

**jman457** (7.8): I really like the production and vibe of this song

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): Don't know how to swim but let's breathe underwater, it's so clever and mind-blowing how she hints on this specific lyric and in other moments on other tracks what is going to happen on the final track. Her mind!

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): why are the bops hidden so deep in the album???

**bookthieving** (7): mona lisa, the original basic bitch

**throwaway7650** (7): that thing going on in the instrumental is kind of annoying

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): criminally short. solid track given its length

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): I love the verses on this one but much like a few other songs from the collective Dedicated era, the chorus is just kinda weak. Still bops but not as much as it could have

**waluigiest** (7): okay the material is there!! But why didn’t she finish the song???",Awkward_King,,7,7,2021-05-29 19:18:50

I was so surprised to see this make Day 2, if for nothing else than the fact that it has ""(Interlude)"" in the title which is basically a death wish unless your name is Tina Taught Me. But I was very happy, one of my highlights on the album for sure. I do wish she had gone a little more into the briefly touched on theme of nihilism and disillusionment with society and the planet though, but the second verse will do!

---

# guys im sorry idk what the video im playing in beatsense rn is blame rina for making all her official uploads topic videos and thus blocked in random countries

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (11): I listen to this song when I’m mad at the world and it’s a wretched place. I listened to this song when I’m sad and everything. It’s very much a mood and I really like it.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): I find it so difficult to find something bad to say about this track - perfect instrumental, Rina's voice is again just imbued with a beautiful mix of indignation, defiance, and of course self-defeat about the power and money hungry state of the world. Like girl, same, fuck this world. Also love the callbacks to Take Me As I Am and 10-20-40 in the outro.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Interludephobia will strike again but this is IT. A turning point in the album.

**Alumineous** (10): Interlude? Interlude.

**bespectacIed** (10): Wish this was a full song, so beautiful. Especially 1:50 onwards

**Oberionsynth** (10): why is this not a full song

**pat-rickstar** (10): I hate Rina for labelling this an interlude because that means it'll be robbed in this rate. The little snippets of RINA songs at the end is one of my favourite moments on the album

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Nobody else does interludes like Rina, this, Through The Wire and Time Out are far too good for little interludes

**runaway3212** (10): bop!

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this may be the first interlude that i thoroughly enjoyed, it is honestly a standout track in the album for me.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): even the interlude slaps. like??????? she sends me into orbit during the last verses here

**throwaway7650** (10): this will probably go out day 1 undeservingly. great lyrics, love the callbacks to the RINA EP

**fairytalehigh** (9.4): not her calling out elon like that ??

**artzpop** (9): could have easily been an entire song

**conceptualromance** (9): too short!!!

**cremeebrulee** (9): chloe x halle  rina: making interludes that shouldve been full songs

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): crying to this song when covid cases peaked in my state was my identity for a few months lol when are we building a mars colony to escape ppl on earth

**liberalitea** (9): so fucking good for an interlude.

**lolcevan** (9): i forgot how fucking good this song was when the bit near the end hit it made me levitate

**poptartchill** (9): Over time, this interlude has become one of my favorite songs by her

**Qustomar** (9): This and Time Out both could have been full songs honestly! But even as interludes, they are a lot more substantial than many recent 2-minute long singles so whatevers lol.

**ReallyCreative** (9): I actually adore this interlude, maybe it should have been developed into a whole song, but I love how it fits in sonically after Bad Friend.

**Stryxen** (9): the way that the (interlude) in the title cemented its fate for day 1 when it would otherwise be a DAE Fuck This World (album track) underrated??

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): Point off for being an interlude, but it’s a great interlude

**Vultuxe** (9): This is an interlude? It's better than most of the songs I've heard so far. The production pops off.

**xaviersi** (9): I mean she has a point

**anothertown** (8.5): it evokes the Time Out interlude in a way which i love

**celladonn** (8.5): I can't give EVERY song on this album over a 9 so I guess I will be slightly interludephobic

**geraldinewww** (8.5): interlude but it's almost 3 minutes? girl

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): so true

**juanolsen** (8.5): i love the lyrics but I don't like the fact that it sounds so similar to the previous song

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Completely relatable after 2020, and the production is just sooo good.

**racloves** (8.5): when Rina does interludes better than your favs singles

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): There are two types of singers in the world. Those whose interludes are actually the shortest song on the album and earn the title “interlude” and those who are Halsey (but this is a rant for another rate)

**SupremeShani** (8.5): We appreciate a bop about our dissatisfaction with our society. Even if the message isn't anything special or offers any meaningful commentary, it does a good job of getting that feeling across. Someone compared the dreaminess in this song to Utada's work, and I can totally see it.

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): We really oughta take better care of our planet.

**afs** (8): It may be an interlude, but it's a damn strong one, albeit a little repetitive.

**CarlieScion** (8): more interludes that are actually just songs thank u

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the way this interlude is longer than a lot of songs in this rate

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): ""This is our mission impossible / May be unlovable / May be unstoppable / But it's worth trying"" Queen of raising awareness for climate change so that we can have a better future for ourselves.

**ManofOranges** (8): Everyday I wake up and this is what I think to myself.

**notarobot3675** (8): this interlude is better than a lot of artists proper songs lol

**rickikardashian** (8): fuck this gay earth

**skargardin** (8): really stretching the definition of interlude here aren't we

**SmileAndTears** (8): Sis really just called a full ass song an interlude lol

**thedoctordances1940** (8): I bet if this song didn't have the word interlude in its title, its average would be quite a bit higher.

**urfavgalpal** (8): great interlude that work on its own as a song.  Love how it bridges the transition from the very depressing bad friend into the fucking absolutely killing who’s gonna save u now

**vayyiqra** (8): [comment about how this is too long to be an interlude]

**waluigiest** (8): ok Elon musk

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8): Love the call back to the Rina EP songs

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.9): very nice RINA EP vibes

**ggal2020** (7.8): another song I sing to myself any time something bad happens

**bbfan132** (7.5): the outro <3 <3 stream rina

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The songwriting is really immature and clunky but her emotion sells this for me.

**Itsafudgingstick** (7.5): I know I wrote for “Overwhelmed” that I can only rate interludes sooo high, but like, this is such a good interlude lmao! Also it’s almost 3 mins, that’s basically a full fledged song!

**jasannn** (7.5): This interlude is more fleshed out than over half of position most of these short songs that everyone is putting out these days.

**Palutzel** (7.5): even the interlude rocks

**salivantsonority** (7.5): Placement is a little weird. Kinda groovy but not that much of a standout.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): She's got a point

**TiltControls** (7.5): me when chosen family ends up bottom 5

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): kinda in a weird limbo between actual interlude and full song

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute i suppose

**engifear** (7): I wonder if this song is gonna flop just because it has ""Interlude"" in the title

**J\_Toe** (7): this interlude is actually one of the best tracks on the album

**KennyEarthman** (7): I wonder why it's an interlude cuz it sounds like a full song to me

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): We interrupt this album for a brief message from our sponsor: people who hate this stupid planet

**musical\_pyn** (7): definitely an interlude unfortunately because this is great

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i love how this is an interlude but longer than 80% of songs coming out atm

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): aww come on Rina… this is the moment where you finally delve deep into the anti-capitalist themes of SAWAYAMA and you only delegate it to an interlude? At least it’s not that short",Awkward_King,,5,5,2021-05-29 19:12:37

I absolutely love Maia, which is why I wish I liked her music more haha. This isn't bad in any way it just doesn't particularly do anything for me, and they both sound lovely on it. Still, I am surprised it outlasted both of Carly's other bonus tracks, and... most of her regular tracks too.

---

# on your own

**1998tweety** (10): smash

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Why have I never heard this. This is amazing.

**Alumineous** (10): Wow, I really like this. I love both their voices and the slower tempo. Just a nice song to chill out to.

**letsallpoo** (10): the best thing carly did in 2020

**RandomHypnotica** (10): mxmtoon isn't my favourite artist, but I really do like this song a lot, plus it's nice to hear Carly on a slower-paced, moodier track.

**throwaway7650** (10): this is a LOT better than I remembered

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): ; the best Carly song here

**amiriteor** (9): this is a big sister song and for that i stan

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): i went into this not wanting to like it but mxmtoon and Carly sound great together on this

**pat-rickstar** (9): This is actually really cute, forgot how much I liked this

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): what a gorgeous song

**ReallyCreative** (9): yeah a joint slay

**vayyiqra** (9): Unexpected collab but cute!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This is the first time I’ve ever listened to mxmtoon and OH MY GOD she sounds so good?? I’ll have to check out more of her music! In other words this 9 is for her and not Carly I’m sorry...

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): mxmtoon should have been in the EP Rate (even though her EPs became an album)

**LostintheCosmicFire** (8.5): soo pretty, mxmtoon's voice is so sexy and contrasts so much with carly

**bespectacIed** (8): wtf this filipina queen had a song with carly that i never knew???

**fadedblue09** (8): Ok I think I want acoustic Carly back

**frogaranaman** (8): god they sound so GOOD together

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is cute coffee shop music

**jaztinax** (8): i always thought this song was really cute and pleasant to listen to even though it’s technically kinda boring?? idk i really enjoy this tho

**pig-serpent** (8): Man Carly just slides into this style and eats it up doesn't she.

**racloves** (8): Maia is so cute she deserves everything

**runaway3212** (8): cute but they don't really bring out the best in eachother

**skargardin** (8): actually serving

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): This is really good, I think Carly should explore this sound a bit more in her own music

**fairytalehigh** (7.7): not my favorite mxmtoon tune but like, imagine carly hit you up to collaborate on a song about loneliness in 2020. just imagine

**akanewasright** (7.5): God, Maia is such a sweetheart

**poptartchill** (7.5): I forgot about this song so thanks for the reminder!

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): Can’t relate

**afs** (7): pretty chill acoustic to vibe to when you're in the mood

**iniekcja\_** (7): it's pretty

# (this song is) ok

**nick1372** (7): I’m not a fan of this genre of chill sadboy/girl music and I dislike it even more when it’s driven by these fake, unchanging looped guitars. After a few listens, I’ve decided this is a decent take on this kind of song but I would never have given it a second chance if Carly wasn’t on it.

**SupremeShani** (7): she is basically harmless, but i can't get into mxmtoon for some reason, and i listen to so many adjacent tiktok artist like her too

**wavingwolves** (6.9): just the right amount of relatableness

**Palutzel** (6.8): kinda boring for my taste

**jman457** (6.6): Cute but not really a fav

**bbfan132** (6.5): relaxing song to have on in the background

**pheromenos** (6.5): i'm being so stingy with my bonus scores lmao

**targetguest** (6.5): cute!

**KennyEarthman** (6): run-of-the-mill break up song

**musical\_pyn** (6): cute bop

**Roxieloxie** (6): well, something has to go out first!

**urfavgalpal** (6): i mean it’s a nice song it’s just not my vibe

**IIIHenryIII** (5): The string instrument (I think it's a ukulele) throws me off. I kinda have a hard time enjoying strings on popish songs. They either sound good and fit the song or make it straight bad. I really like Carly's voice on this track though.

**Vultuxe** (5): I listened to it and then immediately forgot it so yeah.

**engifear** (4): Can we ban the ukelele from bedroom pop songs already

**ggal2020** (4): mxmtoon seems like a very nice person, but god her music is so lame

**liberalitea** (4): meh

I stand firmly on the side of Jack Antonoff rights, I am a slut for the the basic synths he uses with every pop girl, I am the average, bland white person he markets his songs towards and it fucking works. This is such a nice official collaboration between the two of them, and is a song that I think improves as it goes, the ""come with me, I am the keeper"" bridge is so lovely, and I really enjoy their voices together. However, it is not Hate That You Know Me, and for that it loses half a point.

---

# no no come back dont leave the rate ahahah

**just\_thonking** (11): Exhibit A of why Jack Antonoff deserves rights

**seeyanever** (11): Jack and Carly are at their best with this one

**welcometoNY** (11): jack antonoff supremacy

**1998tweety** (10): we love bleachers

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Obviously Jack's fingerprints are all over this track but it doesn't stop this song from being amazing, love the sort of throwback vibe this one has (I think? It definitely feels vintage without sounding like it), great melody to the whole thing.

**bbfan132** (10): i love this synthpop sound, carly sounds wonderful here (and jack sounds great too!)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Might be the best low-key CRJ bop. That bridge is so pretty.

**celladonn** (10): Not to sound like a Bleachers stan but this is just undeniably the best song on the album

**conceptualromance** (10): I’m mad this wasn’t on the actual Dedicated album. THIS is a B Side, Ms Jepsen?

**fadedblue09** (10): As one of the resident Antonoff haters on this sub, I have to concede to him on this one. For once, instead of drowning Carly in excessive cheesiness, he takes a backseat and let Carly's soulful vocals take center stage. That and the more mature themes (self-love and independence!) makes this one of her best songs since All That.

**fairytalehigh** (10): between the antonoff/CRJ harmonies and oblique references to all-night blowjob marathons, it doesn't get much better than this

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Everything Jack touches turns into gold.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): yes im a jackoff, give me the death penalty idc

**Leixander** (10): COME WITH ME I'M THE KEEPER OF THAT BEAT AND THE FIRE UNDER YOUR FEET, I'M A KEEPER MAAAAAAAN! I'M THE KEEPER!

**liberalitea** (10): best song on the album honestly

**mudkip1** (10): why does this sound so good

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is my second favorite song from dedicated a&b (only behind too much)

**nooodisaster** (10): Beautiful. Works both romantically and as a career reflection, and the production is weighty enough to hold both interpretations with the dignity they deserve.

**pat-rickstar** (10): When balladphobia is defeated by this being Carly's highest song, as it should be

**pig-serpent** (10): The best soft song on the album.

**pros-and-connors** (10): mom and dad together at last ??

**runaway3212** (10): I really love this so much

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This self-care anthem is the best song on the album and I’m not even a Jack stan. As someone who tries to care for others while pushing my own emotions to the side, I feel like Carly is speaking directly to me.

**salivantsonority** (10): Loved this song; wouldn't have been mad if this made it onto Side A. All the best things about a Carly song here. Like a more lowkey sibling to ""Your Type"". Beautiful post-chorus.

**shhhneak** (10): Jackoff supremacy continues.

**skargardin** (10): we have to ascend

**SmileAndTears** (10): I mean, of course the best song on the album is the Bleachers collab

**Tedyonce** (10): best song on Side B

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this is cute

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): i'm such a sucker for this classic antonoff/bleachers sound. and the bridge is fantastic

**Turpamutteri** (10): Bleachers wohoo

**vagenda** (10): Carly knows that everything is better in moderation and that includes Jack Antonoff. Could she make a whole album with him? Probably, if she wanted to. But she chooses instead to keep her options open and put out only the best of the best of what they make together and I respect the hell out of that. All of their collabs are big fat 10s and this is no exception

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes I am an unrepentant Jackoff stan. All haters are directed to go argue with the wall.

**Vultuxe** (10): Comeback is gorgeous, would give it another 11 if I could. I'm surprised at how impactful the hook is while also being deceptively simple and catchy.

**wasian-invasion** (10): i'd let jack antonoff cum on my ba

**zagreux** (10): u/lordemusic

**wavingwolves** (9.8): i love this bleachers song omfg

**notarobot3675** (9.7): i have a confession... i like jack antonoff as a producer :s i think he gets a bad wrap. anyways this is one of the best songs on this album imho

**Alumineous** (9): Bleachers being credited like a female feature on a Taylor Swift song.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I haven't heard the main album yet but wow I am surprised this was initially scrapped because the song feels like it could be a nice transition from Emotion to Dedicated. At least we get to hear this masterpiece through a B-side album! Dang, we need more collabs from CRJ and Antonoff.

**iniekcja\_** (9): Jack Antonoff gets hotter with every occasion

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): Jack Antonoff is just teasing us at this point….give us new Bleachers! Or actually, Lorde first, then Bleachers, then you can make as many more Carly and Taylor albums as you want and I'll listen to them all

**nick1372** (9): I’m such a sucker for Carly singing over Jack Antonoff production that I can look past the fact that the lyrics to this make absolutely no fucking sense. I’ll be waiting on that carly + jack musical until the day I die

**poptartchill** (9): this is really just a Bleachers song with Carly singing but it's a good one

**Raykel** (9): Imagine if this was on Dedicated instead. I know it's about a relationship, but just the line ""I was thinking about making a comeback"" would've been so powerful after the long break after Emotion. A very humble ""What you gon do when I appear???"" moment.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I will continue to defend Jack with my life (give us the new Bleachers album though, Jack!)

**steelstepladder** (9): This album is backloaded AF

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): Gay coming of age movie soundtrack ft. Jack Antonoff

**amiriteor** (8.9): it just gets

**savemeaseat143** (8.9): the bridge!

**camerinian** (8.5): more into high-energy Bleachers than vibey Bleachers, but Ugh dreamy

**jsonphile** (8.5): another man??? Can this be true???

**rickikardashian** (8.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwN-BUDSHDo

**seanderlust** (8.5): this is a carly-fronted bleachers song but that's ok because I like bleachers

**SupremeShani** (8.5): when i was originally listening to this album, i really thought i was a genius for clocking the obvious jack off ants's production before i actually looked at the title and saw that it's a literal bleachers cover, ugh my mind

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): One of my favorites from this album. Her and Jack sound magical together

**jman457** (8.4): Carly really Jacked Anton off on here

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): the way I can’t help but associate this with the Lindsay Lohan comeback single that came out at the same time and uses the same lyrical concept

**juanolsen** (8.1): the bleachers feature is nice but is sound too much like something out of strange desire",Awkward_King,,4,4,2021-05-29 20:10:29

I appreciate Rina's venture into it's-not-really-hyperpop-but-I'm-gonna-call-it-hyperpop-because-it's-kinda-funky-bleep-bloop-sounding, even if it's not my favourite on the album. I think these are some of Rina's strongest lyrics from the album, even if the chorus is a bit repetitive, and I like that it touches in more detail on what Dynasty did in the album intro.

---

# akasaka happy :)

**1998tweety** (10): this will be robbed but its a smash

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Definitely a grower but man do I love the kind of glitchy, swaggering beat to this, with this sort of chaotic instrumental paired with the internal dilemma on display of being in between East and West that Rina is in, it's super catchy and danceable. Also I might be a few years too young for it but the 'Twenty-eight and I still want to scream' line... bitch, me too. The fuck.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): I think this is the song that has grown on the most. Not everyone gets to travel to another country to combat a depressive episode or get out of emotional funk but I think we’ve all tried to look for happiness in something external like a place or person or hobby only to realize it doesn't quite get the job done. Sometimes it all just seems hopeless, no matter what you do or in this case, no matter where you go.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is painful, why can I relate.

**Dekubaku** (10): I'm a sucka for hese wordplays!

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): i really love and relate it How Rina talked about family, mental health and being tied to different cultures and countries.

**ggal2020** (10): if this album was an essay this would be the thesis

**IIIHenryIII** (10): The chorus is so simple yet so brilliant. She manages to say so many things using so many few words.

**juanolsen** (10): this song really blows my mind every time, the lyrics and the production are otherworldly

**LuisEnRod** (10): a song about feeling depressed and lost in your 20s? Sign me up!

**moooo566** (10): This has been stuck in my brain for basically a year at this point, just circling round and round and round. Very nearly my 11.

**plastichaxan** (10): the power this song holds over me is insane, everything about this song is just perfect

**sarcasticsobs** (10): clarence did this for US

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Y’all did this one dirty

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): on the note of this one let me just say i'm so fucking proud of her for breaking down the barriers for the uk's awards shows and being recognized for both her identities. literally the best album to come out of that country in YEARS and they stonewalled her.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): I love how the less-traditional structure sort of gives it an anxious quality that enhances the lyrics

**urfavgalpal** (10): this song is so fun to me.  I think a lot of the sounds on this are things she recorded when she was staying at a specific hotel?  I don’t remember exactly what it was but I think it really shows her creativity

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): ""akasaka sad cause i'm a sucker, sucker how i suffer"" is such a crazy hook! honestly, a banger

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Love when Clarence gets a bit weirder with the production here

**SupremeShani** (9.5): It makes me sad that this will probably be on the lower end of SAWAYAMA songs, because it really is one of the more experimental songs on the album that works.

**akanewasright** (9): I was fully ready to give this song a respectful 7 (aka “it’s good but I don’t personally love it”), but then I listened with good earbuds and realized how fucking good the production is.

**anothertown** (9): 28 and i still wanna scream!

**bbfan132** (9): i love how wonky this is lol, i enjoyed the trap influence quite a bit too

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): As an Asian immigrant kid who now resides in my homeland country, I definitely feel for Rina's homesickness displayed in this song.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): akasaka triste

**KennyEarthman** (9): Clarence Clarity snapped in this one

**liberalitea** (9): the Japanese in the 2nd verse and the final chorus makes me ASCEND. i just wish it was longer

**Oberionsynth** (9): i too am sad wherever I go

**pig-serpent** (9): If Rina pivoted into only releasing Arca inspired glitch pop for the rest of her career I wouldn't be complaining.

**waluigiest** (9): the “akasaka sad, I guess I’ll be sad” hook is brilliant

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8.8): 28 and i still wanna screaaaam

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): would be higher but the production on the second verse bugs me

**nick1372** (8.5): songs about being sad when you’re supposed to be happy get me every fuckin time

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): this is a cool song for what it pulls off but it's not among my favorites

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This took a few listens for me but the lyrics really brought me into it. It also stands out on the album sonically.

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): This might be the most weird song on the album? It has such a disconcerting vibe which I love cause it fits so well with the theme of Rina not being able to reconnect fully with her birthplace of Japan and feeling like a stranger

**musical\_pyn** (8): another song that just goes so hard

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): ok does anyone else hear the similarity between the akasada sad parts and what goes around comes around by JT??

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): such a haunting sound. it goes all over the place in the best way

**endcreditouilles** (7.8): I don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl I am living in that second verse

**wavingwolves** (7.8): love the play of words in this sooo much

**jasannn** (7.5): Not my favorite track but the production goes hard here.

**salivantsonority** (7.5): Experimental. Needed more time in the lab?

# akasaka sad :(

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): It's fine

**throwaway7650** (7.5): can't get myself to love this song unfortunately

**afs** (7): I wasn't too fond for most of the hip-hop (is it?), but the second chorus absolutely bangs.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): well turn that frown upside down!

**ktajlili** (7): I don't listen to this one much but it's creative and interesting.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): It's good, just not much more. It's the end of the weakest stretch of the album for me so at least after this everything only gets better.

**Uberpigeon** (7): I like the production but not too keen on the vocals

**vayyiqra** (7): Trap banger (this is a joke). I used to think the chorus was a bit weak but the bridge is really good.

**geraldinewww** (6.6): sucks to be me. sucks to be so lonely.

**jaztinax** (6.5): this song switches between being a 5 and a 8 for me depending on which part of the song it is so i’m torn

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): the assonance in the chorus is so satisfying, the rest of the song just doesn't do it for me

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (6): This one is still good overall, but really one of the Sawayama songs that I've gotten most tired of

**nooodisaster** (6): Screaming that this is technically the title track since she name drops her own name.

**Vultuxe** (6): It kinda pops off but it seems a bit silly and not in a good way?

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): The instrumental is cool but the chorus annoys me

**fadedblue09** (5): I understand what she was trying to do with this but I'm not sure if it worked.

**runaway3212** (5): a bit repetative but good

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): What I expected from SAWAYAMA: a thoughtful and poetic treatise on the negative effects of capitalism on everyday life / What I got: a-ka-sa-ka-sa-wa-ya-ma

A moment of silence for this Carly. It pass away. It had beautiful album. It had kinda been a meme ever since this rate was announced that Carly would flop and miss Day 3... but I think it actually happening is a bit of a shock and especially her literally being #17, that's gotta sting. Summer Love is great and I kinda regret not giving it a 10, I love the instrumental break in the middle, I only remember that because I am listening to it as I write this and it just came on and I forgot how good it was, but it's a highlight of the song. I think I'm gonna blast the fuck out of this this Summer.

---

# they tried to save carly, but it was too late

**artzpop** (11): idc i listen to this song every day and it hasn't aged one bit

**Turpamutteri** (11): This is a great summer song that I listened to a lot last summer

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A discography highlight. It’s what singlehandedly makes Dedicated Side B superior to Side A.

**Alumineous** (10): Another grower. For Carly Rae standards, this is as sultry as it gets. Also, I got a bit of ABBA vibes in that instrumental bridge.

**anothertown** (10): everybody say thank you patrik berger

**conceptualromance** (10): I imagine this is what Disco Sweat would’ve been like </3

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I love the guitar. I really like the various things she does with her voice here

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The lyrics, the vocals, and the production is so damn sexy and summer-y. This is definitely the mature Carly that I was exactly expecting and she served perfectly.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): DO THE NU-DISC... oh.

**endcreditouilles** (10): the way she says 'summer love' makes my soul leave my body and reenter through my foofer

**frogaranaman** (10): that fucking BASSSSS

**hakkerj** (10): The real song of 2020, reminds me of a Tame Impala song

**hunnybee12** (10): the only track from side b that stuck out to me at release and that I still listen to

**ignitethephoenix** (10): my favorite from the album, love how fun and sensual it is. A nice groovy bop

**jasannn** (10): Combining summer and disco, this song was designed for me to love.

**Leixander** (10): Always reimagining this as a pop-rock song whenever I listen to it.

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): that sax

**nootnoot781** (10): gayme impala. i hope she ventures more into this direction, i love this sound on her!!

**pat-rickstar** (10): Need Carly to make more songs with this sound

**plastichaxan** (10): she's so smart putting the best song after the worst one to make this seem better

**poptartchill** (10): I didn't notice this one for a while but now believe me I did

**Qustomar** (10): OH THIS IS THE SERVE.

**ReallyCreative** (10): that guitar, that little string lick, holy shit she was in her element with this one

**rosecoloreds** (10): this should've been on dedicated

**runaway3212** (10): so true

**seanderlust** (10): this is a highlight of the album

**skargardin** (10): this better not be underrated

**targetguest** (10): I drove from PA to Florida in May and was in Florida when this album dropped. Nothing like a northeasterner getting to drive with the windows down to a song like this for their entire quarantine

**throwaway7650** (10): after several listens I couldn't not give this a 10. imo this could fit on aly & AJ's new album (stream ATOTBGYUOYFGYOATITS)

**vayyiqra** (10): An 11 contender but I predict a Carlycide in this rate. Sad!

**wavingwolves** (10): this is the pussy part of the album and we love it

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): The guitar...

**zagreux** (10): carly rae and the feeling. name a more iconic duo.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): Dammit Carly you know i cant resist a good bass

**urfavgalpal** (9.7): Another great track.  Honestly I don’t get why people hate on this album?  Most of these songs are really good.  There’s a really weird energy to this that I really dig.  It sounds like a memory which probably makes no sense but I’m going with it.  There are a few songs on this album when as soon as I hear the first few notes by body just automatically starts dancing and this is one of those.

**1998tweety** (9.5): im levitating

**just\_thonking** (9.5): I love Tame Impala

**Vultuxe** (9.5): Summer Love is lush and vibrant, it's an excellent song. I wish the bridge was more than a repeat of the chorus, but can't win them all.

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): brb manifesting a summer of vaccinated love

**notarobot3675** (9.4): another one of my favourites from the album. it feels very different for carly and i think she pulled off this particular vibe well, would really like to hear more of this from her in the future!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): Sounds like exactly what it says on the label, and I love that!

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Another pretty good rager in the tracklist, nothing much to say. Love the guitars

**afs** (9): More funk, but this is executed SO much better. Certified summer banger.

**akanewasright** (9): [the bass riff...](https://imgur.com/a/fKs6FaX)

**bbfan132** (9): tame impala but better

**celladonn** (9): Unrestrained summer fun

**IIIHenryIII** (9): It feels like something from the past but it sounds so modern. Future Nostalgia could never (I just really don't like that album at all, I'm so sorry).

**KennyEarthman** (9): groovy and funky

**nick1372** (9): Best production on the album but the lyrics are a bit underwritten

**Stryxen** (9): i feel like i could make this song

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): really smooth vocal delivery

**vagenda** (8.9): Kevin Parker was gonna send a cease and desist but he was too busy bopping Fake Mona Lisa: 8.7 I know Carly doesn’t actually say the F-word in this…….but she could

**cashewconstellation** (8.8): i'm embarrassed to say i didn't really vibe with this song at first but NOW? incredible, amazing, showstopping, spectacular

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): love how carly released a better tame impala song in 2020 than half the actual 2020 tame impala album

**ggal2020** (8.5): ready to have a vaccinated girl summer soundtracked by this song

**juanolsen** (8.5): cute bop, nothing else to say

**kirby31200** (8.5): The Less I Love the Summer

**shhhneak** (8.5): Show us the location of Disco Sweat’s body Carly

**jman457** (8.3): This kind of reminds me of a Tame Impala song, and im not mad about it.

**savemeaseat143** (8.2): funky

**CrimsonROSET** (8): got this feeling in my booooody clap

**jackisboredtoday** (8): i’m basic what can i say

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): The bop of the summer….that never was. Robbed of Summer Love 2020 because of COVID hurts afted being robbed of Cruel Summer 2019 due to......poor single choice

**liberalitea** (8): it's a really fresh song and i like the guitar in the chorus

**oscarbrierley1** (8): fun

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): Everyone made fun of Dua last year for being a bad disco pastiche but this song kinda feels more pastiche-y to me. Still good, but derivative I guess?

**Vromega** (8): Perfect verses, but I expected a bit more from the chorus. the end is boring too

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): the groove in this is really nice. I like how the melody dips on the second ""all the time""

**SupremeShani** (7.5): It perfectly captures the mood of a summer night, the guitar work, synths, and little string breakdown make me nostalgic for some reason. Her vocals have this hint of desperation here that really pairs well with the song.

**Oberionsynth** (7): idk why but this song just screams ""i'm canadian"", also hella ABBA vibes in the bridge synth",Awkward_King,,5,5,2021-05-29 21:19:32

I replayed the fuck out of this when it came out and kinda forgot about it since, but it is still a bop I think? The mixing isn't like *noticeably* bad to me, whereas I think it completely turned a lot of people off hahaha. The ""you're sort of a dick but, someone out there is surely gonna love a dick"" is pure Carly camp.

---

# is surely gonna love a dick

**Alumineous** (10): Carly Rae, this is what I'm talking about. This is amazing.

**bespectacIed** (10): ""This was camp"" is the most overused phrase ever, but this was camp

**KennyEarthman** (10): I ugly laughed at the bridge lmao

**ManofOranges** (10): Thought it was a let-down at first but I've slowly come around on it.

**moooo566** (10): i'd say like 50% of the time my real 11 is in the bonus. it's this one.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): i know i personally said this sounds like an ashlee simpson song but that isn't shade. it's a good thing. ashlee come back we miss u even if your name is spelled wrong

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is way better than it has any right to be, it's just really fun and cute, like all Carly songs should be

**Raxxin** (10): she needs to release a full album like this we need evil spiteful carly

**shesdoingyoga** (10): If there is an audiobook of the dictionary, this would be the example under the definition of “camp”

**targetguest** (10): literally so mad this was one of the first songs eliminated by the crj subreddit it's one of my tops of 2020

**throwaway7650** (10): this is a 10 for the spoken bridge alone

**vayyiqra** (10): wtf I love this

**waluigiest** (10): this made me so sassy for like a month

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): this is fun

**amiriteor** (9): idk its just a nine she has her lil sassy deep voice going

**hakkerj** (9): She was in her bag with this song

**liberalitea** (9): this is such an interesting sound from Carly and I don't know exactly how to feel, but I think I like it

**pros-and-connors** (9): a ghosting anthem! ??

**seanderlust** (9): look, I get that this is about an ex, but this is like...the process of making friends in seattle lol

**hikkaru** (8.5): kinda horrible mixing or whatever but it does bop a lil

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): lord this reminded me that by the time the reveal happens there will finally have been some drama in my friend circle and I live

**jman457** (8.5): love the sarcastic love song

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I really like this song, sorry

**SupremeShani** (8.5): the productions choices and clipping are definitely intentional, you all need to stop disrespecting our indie queen carly rae jepsen

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8.5): ""You're kind of a dick""

**AHSWeeknd** (8): “You smiling, like a devil” is the same as “he looks up, grinning like a devil”

**poptartchill** (8): I was super into this song when it came out and it's still a bop

**TragicKingdom1** (8): underrated despite her recording underwater

**welcome2thejam** (8): Loses a point for the spoken word bridge, but makes it back with the great pre-chorus. Also the Carly drawing in the video is super cute!

**urfavgalpal** (7.9): I love to bop to this and then act out the little skits

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): reminds me of February 2020…. a time when I was THRIVING, so now I’m sad hearing this and imagining what would’ve happened if things kept going like that

**jasannn** (7.5): I can see why I haven't listened to the song in about a year but it's still pretty cute.

**racloves** (7.5): sassy break up song I love it

**EnCaine** (7): it's me. i'm the person out there who is surely gonna love a dick

**LostintheCosmicFire** (7): this is fun, although her voice kinda sounds annoying here

**nick1372** (7): This is probably one of the best vocal performances Carly has done ever? The production is not great and the mixing is horrible but I respect that she tried something new

**pheromenos** (7): ""someone out there is surely gonna love a dick"" omg gay twinks representation

**runaway3212** (7): bop

**Vultuxe** (6.5): The vocal affects are strange but it does kinda bop

# baby ur ma enemy

**afs** (7): I hear the Gwen Stefani influence, and while I do love her cover of Don't Speak, she sounds a bit weird here.

**notarobot3675** (7): this is cute but is lacking something for me

**pat-rickstar** (7): A bop but the vocals are kinda off

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): I like the change in sound and the spoken word section but the chorus is lukewarm

**fairytalehigh** (6.5): there is just something OFF about the sound quality of the guitar line that drives me insane and ruins this song for me. the interlude at the end though? ??

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.5): I really like the melody and flow of the song but the vocal performance is kinda grating

**bbfan132** (6): the concept is fun and there are some decent melodies within the song but overall, it’s kind of lackluster

**fadedblue09** (6): Cute Tug of War throwback, but the bridge is so cringe

**frogaranaman** (6): I mean it’s okay

**hunnybee12** (6): what was the point of this release

**ImADudeDuh** (6): people really went ""omfg carly said 'dick' in this song""

**musical\_pyn** (6): hm something's off in the production I think, but a decent track

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): “Never speak again” “Hope we can remain good friends” uhh Carly I’m getting mixed messages. Also the guy in the turtleneck sweater kinda looks like me. Lol.

**celladonn** (5): Mean Carly doesn't really work for me

**geraldinewww** (5): oooooOOOH MOM CARLY SAID DICK MOOOOOMMM

**slimboyfriend** (5): I cannot tell u how disappointed I was when I heard there was a new CRJ song and then it turned out to be THIS.

**wasian-invasion** (5): never bothered listening to this again after it came out

**1998tweety** (4): meh

**akanewasright** (4): this song has good elements (especially the production), but the topline is just kinda... meh

**IIIHenryIII** (4): The guitar ruins this song for me. I would totally vibe to it with a different production.

**pig-serpent** (4): This is mostly a case of just not clicking for me, but I can't imagine having to sit though the ""you're sort of a dick sometimes"" part every time I wanted to listen to a song and still enjoying it.

**shhhneak** (3): oh I still don’t like this.

**skargardin** (3): the vocals are so terribly mixed

**wavingwolves** (3): someone out there will love a dick? couldn't be me

**welcometoNY** (2): absolutely not

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (1): I remember listening to this song when it first came out and I was so confused by why this song sounded like a Train reject. I tried listening to this song for the rate and....if I could give a 0 in the bonus rate, it would be this one. I feel like Carly can do much better than this.

**jayjaysortagay** (1): what is this ?????? her voice has never sounded worse. This is just ""OMG What's Happening"" by Ava Max but 1000x worse

I always loved how like bouncy and video-game (do the VGV rate) esque the instrumentals of this sounded, it drew me to it a lot. Especially juxtaposed with how dark and self-destructive the lyrics are. I didn't expect this to be one of the top Charli tracks, or at least I didn't expect it to outlast pink diamond and party 4 u so much, but I love it so I am not complaining!

---

# idk i couldn't come up w a pun 

**camerinian** (11): I have already written so, so much about this album, but I need to say more about how incredible this centrepiece of the album is. The reckoning of your own mental anguish with someone providing you unconditional love in the face of your own perceived inadequacy is something that hits me really, really hard, and Charli has such a skill for conveying that turmoil. Her hushed tone is just gorgeous and sells the lyrics beautifully, and the deliberate anticlimax at the end of the track is one of the best moments on the album. Being so deadset on detonation only to be fizzled at the end of it all is oddly comforting, and it's a turning point for a more confident Charli later down the tracklist. I just adore this song, the album wouldn't work without it, and it's also one of the more boppy tracks which really helps its essentiality. I love it, I can listen to this at any time and in any mood, and those type of songs are rare.

**pig-serpent** (11): For as much as I stan Charli XCX she's not a singer I tend to connect with emotionally, but Detonate is a huge exception. The vulnerability expressed in this song is amazing and more relatable than I would like it to be. Also, those arps tho.

**wasian-invasion** (11): i LOVE the frenetic production of this, it fits so well with the lyrics and gets me moving every time. Using my 11 here but i seriously doubt this is making day 3

**fairytalehigh** (9.7): those bubbly synths are EVERYTHING

**urfavgalpal** (9.6): I like this a lot and the way it tick tick ticks like the song is gonna detonate and then that end is perfect

**conceptualromance** (9.5): I like the more calm sound of this song. It works well within the album because of how high-energy all of the other songs have been up to this point.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): this song goes like thirty seconds too long but it sounds so cool

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): An underrated song, one of my faves on this album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Low key BDSM anthem.

**bookthieving** (9): i kinda ignored this track on my first few listens but now i'm kinda obsessed with it? the lyrics about insecurity hit hard, and i love how the bubbly synths distort into something darker towards the end

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Quarantine definitely amplified my feelings of self-doubt and self-deprecation so I definitely feel for Charli here.

**nick1372** (9): can’t really explain why this one resonates with me but it really does

**oscarbrierley1** (9): I get the ending but its still really unsatisfying to me, but I love the rest

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): 'pull you close and then i'll be gone' well that hurts but then 'i don't trust myself alone why should you love me' hits and that hurts worse. the whole song i was like yeah beep boop space pop synth but she'd hit me with the lyrics again. it's like getting beaten up by a clown.

**salivantsonority** (9): So dreamy; one of my fav Charli tracks.

**skargardin** (9): the synths are so good here

**TiltControls** (9): this is also great!

**Vultuxe** (9): Detonate is so cute and bubbly it almost does not fit the album. The lyrics are a high point as well. A pleasantly surprising track.

**Palutzel** (8.8): subtler production, beautiful song

**wavingwolves** (8.7): too close for comfort

**jman457** (8.6): giving me postal service vibes, I like the minimalism of the song compared to her other songs.

**bbfan132** (8.5): better version of owl city

**Itsafudgingstick** (8.5): I have unironically done the robot to the breakdown portion at the end of this song – I will continue unironically doing the robot to this portion of the song

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The audience relates...

**targetguest** (8.5): didn't have much love for this song until going through this album again and listening to the lyrics. now it's one of my favs

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): boom

**1998tweety** (8): this is cute tbh

**akanewasright** (8): I love AG Cook’s production so much

**bigbigbee** (8): well you are the one, the one that lies close to me / whispers ‘hello, I’ve missed you quite terribly’ / I fell in love, in love with you suddenly / now there’s no place else I could be, but here in your arms (we need to rate this song so I can give it an 11, vote for the 00s one hit wonder rate)

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): sad and cute. The pacing of the sounds reminded me of drinking too much caffeine sometimes especially since the vocals are kinda slow, fun contrast.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is okay but I wish I was listening to “Explode” from the soundtrack to *Angry Birds* though

**IIIHenryIII** (8): That intro is so good and it makes me happy that it plays in the background almost the entire track.

**iniekcja\_** (8): I don't think it's as good as people make it out to be

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): This is so much more fun and light than I ever would have expected from a Charli XCX song called ""detonate"". Must be the lowercase d

**nootnoot781** (8): halsey when she’s in new york

**runaway3212** (8): This is really relatable, the build up here is immaculate

**shesdoingyoga** (8): I would say DeTENate but it’s not a 10 so instead I will say DetonEIGHT

**throwaway7650** (8): actually like the autotune in this... not a fan of the repetitive outro though, which prevents me from scoring this higher

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): Super catchy and I love the synth textures in this one. Some of her better lyrics too tbh

**vayyiqra** (8): Cute but sad. :pensive:

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I love the little bomb beeping songs in here

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (7.5): the least interesting on the album

**endcreditouilles** (7.5): baby shark do-do-do-do-do-do you love me?

**musical\_pyn** (7.5): I absolutely love the beginning but the rest of the song kinda loses me

**afs** (7): I really like the variation this song goes through, but autotune really puts a damper on emotion. Adore the new sound that comes near the end, though!

**ImADudeDuh** (7): oh this is good, thank goodness.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): always been one of the more uninteresting songs on this album but it's still quite nice

**waluigiest** (7): https://youtu.be/RYit5rOyLAw

**astrologicalangel** (6.5): I love this beat

**liberalitea** (6.5): this song is mostly average but i like the outro

**CarlieScion** (6): idk why should i!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): The outro for this detracts a lot. Like, what the fuck is going on here on this day

**ManofOranges** (6): You would think a song called Detonate would sound more like it's going to explode with sound.

**Oberionsynth** (6): this gives me ""timebomb"" by tove lo vibes. i don't really like that song either

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The instrumentation is like video game music… no I’m serious I’m pretty sure I’ve heard this in a Mario game before

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Is this what a hyper pop ballad is??

**SupremeShani** (5): The instrumental and production go off, just like the rest of the album, but I have so much trouble getting into Charli's contributions for some reason.

**frogaranaman** (4): this is where you can begin to tell this album was made in a month

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): not sure how this type of music can be boring but this song did it

It's really haunting tbh, Halle's vocals are so ethereal but singing about such a haunting topic ist quite the juxtaposition. Taking the position of the other woman is really interesting and I don't think this would be the same song without it in the slightest, so I appreciate that they did, even if I know some people aren't the keenest on cheating songs.

# feminist brain off

**jaztinax** (11): my favorite since first listen. the storytelling, the perspective, the production and the constant build-up to the end - it’s all perfect

**xaviersi** (11): a song that I relate to having been the other man before on top of being their best vocal performances in this album

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This leaves me speechless every time. THE EMOTIONAL DELIVERY.

**akanewasright** (10): I hold this song extra close to my heart because it helped me distinguish Chloe and Halle’s voices

**bespectacIed** (10): There was a discussion thread at the time I was doing this rate about songs that people don't like the message of, and this was one of the answers. Because it's about cheating. In an album named ""ungodly hour"". Lmao.

**bookthieving** (10): the way this song fucking builds!!!!!!!!!! those heavy synth hits are so good

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i think she’s beautiful

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is easily the best song on the album with its strong lyricism, storytelling, and vocals. The song feels so perfectly cinematic that I can imagine a whole storyline with a bunch of characters in my head. The cherry on top is the amazing production and CxH's heavenly vocals. Ugh, I better not see this song out before Day 3, or else I am questioning this subreddit's taste.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): My favorite song on this album, their harmonies are OUT OF THIS WORLD here.

**engifear** (10): The harmonies and production on this song just make me instantly ascend

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I can potentially see this track being divisive but it’s one of my absolute favorites in the whole rate and I very nearly gave it my 11. Placing themselves in the role of “the other woman” was a risky move and I think they were smart to compensate by making this track sound so classy so no one can say that they were being trashy. The gentle intro, the delicate vocal arrangement, the theatrical strings, they really bring you into the world of this character in a way that helps you see past the knee-jerk moralizing reaction to explore the more human, emotional side of the situation. This is the best their vocals sound on the whole album too, I love how they slowly unravel as the song goes on until they completely untether themselves on the bridge, before reigning it all back in and closing out the song just as composed as they were when it began.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Cheating QUEENS

**iniekcja\_** (10): MY SIDE HOE ANTHEM, it's genuinely an amazing song though and deserved to get the grammy

**jsonphile** (10): my favorite on the album. Chloe and Halle just sound angelic here, and not gonna lie this song is...kinda hot.

**KennyEarthman** (10): they both wrote and produced this. it's an amazing song, an album highlight

**musical\_pyn** (10): If this song gets tanked because it's from the perspective of ""the other woman"" I'm tanking evermore

**Oberionsynth** (10): this is everything illicit affairs wanted to be

**oscarbrierley1** (10): I hope this doesn't get booted down the ranking for being slow because that would be a hate crime

**Roxieloxie** (10): SO TELL ME TELL ME BABY , god the harmonies on this song and that tiny desk concert

**shhhneak** (10): wig in the stratosphere.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): i was never a big fan for this kind of r&b song, but sometime i do find myself enjoying one or two and i think this one is one of them.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): gorgeous

**SupremeShani** (10): I know some people here don't like songs about cheating and adultery, but this song immediately stood out to me on this album. The stripped back production with the soft guitars and warbling synths just works so good with the girls harmonizing about such a risque message. Speaking of harmonizing, these are some of the best vocals the twins serve on the whole album.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): ok i get that ppl won't like the topic of this song but i think it's absolutely stunning and the bridge gives me goosebumps everytime. potentially the best vocals on the album (which is saying alot)

**Tedyonce** (10): deserved the Grammy

**thedoctordances1940** (10): This song is just absolutely beautiful. The lyrics are probably the best on the album, telling a really compelling story from the perspective of the other girl, essentially painting themselves as a form of antagonist, which isn't all that common in music. Add to that some of their best vocal performances, the high notes they hit are absolutely angelic, and some of the best production and songwriting and you've got the best song on the album

**throwaway7650** (10): I love how this song builds

**wavingwolves** (10): this song is gay idgaf what anyone has to say about it

**endcreditouilles** (9.7): this build knows how to fuck

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.6): loveee a song about being the other woman

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): what the fuck? this BLEW me away. I was just not ready for the mix, everything coming together at the end... wow. Just wow.

**juanolsen** (9.3): interesting concept and good execution, absolutely love it

**plastichaxan** (9.3): me @ hosts when i submit my scores

**amiriteor** (9): I'm suspending my feminist beliefs bc this song goes so fucking hard

**hakkerj** (9): Love the vocals on this track

**IIIHenryIII** (9): That's fire. I can't get enough of their harmonies. They sound so perfect together. Meeeeeeeeeee! Meeeeeeeeeee! Chef's kiss!

**jasannn** (9): This beautiful ballad has the best vocals in the album.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): Last 3 songs on this album are just.....so perfect. Could listen to the 3 on loop forever

**rosecoloreds** (9): if i was straight that'd be my cheating anthem

**seanderlust** (9): oh work. the other woman banger

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This feels classic

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): Me about my crush’s girlfriend who doesn’t think of me

**Vromega** (9): would be a fantastic Disney song

**waluigiest** (9): love how it flips the infidelity tropes in a lot of ways

**jman457** (8.8): Soring vocals on this makes it one of my favs.

**savemeaseat143** (8.6): narrator deserves better

**1998tweety** (8.5): beautiful

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8.5): It’s interesting to get a song about being the other woman. “You’ve done this before so who are you to judge” is a really pointed defensive line in the song that’s interesting to me because you wouldn’t be thinking about what the wife/gf thinks if you weren’t judging yourself. I really like the emotions in the song

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): love the perspective of being the other girl here. They both sound so haunting and great

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): not a huge fan of the disney princess vocal at the beginning, but i love the premise and the execution otherwise

**afs** (8): Normally I don't listen to lyrics much, but this one particularly stood out to me for its theme and maturity.

**artzpop** (8): Well I think she thinks it is a bit weird to make a song about it

**bbfan132** (8): pretty ballad, definitely gets better in the second half

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): Really came for SZA’s Heaux Anthems crown with this track

**martian\_pet** (8): Infidelity bop, Unfaithful and The Weekend found crying in a corner

**nick1372** (8): probably the best vocal performance on the album. Love the concept and it’s executed really well

**nooodisaster** (8): I wondered if this was an old classic, so I was shocked when I found out it was solely written and produced by Chloe and Halle. Mad props.

**pig-serpent** (8): Strong vocal showcase with good melodies. I'm normally not into this type of thing but this is actually really good.

**poptartchill** (8): This was one of my favorites first listen and it's still great!

**Uberpigeon** (8): Who doesnt love a song about being the other woman. Beautiful singing from Halle on this one too

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): I love the vocals on this so much, the last couple songs on this album get so ethereal

If I'm being honest I think a lot of my adoration for this song comes from the fucking stunning billboard performance, visually that is one of my favourite perfomances not just from the pandemic but honestly the last few years. It's *so* well styled and shot I could go on about it for hours and honestly, watch me in the reveal. This song actually lingered around Day 1 almost the entire rate so I'm glad it pulled through in the end, if not mostly because it meant I got to start the reveal with hey breonna...

# My video for Rina and Chloe and Halle for our Day 3

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Love the bouncy production for this song that kind of dissolves in the chorus for something a bit more lively, wonderful track

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I’m not a baby or a girl so I can’t relate but it’s a whole bop.

**Alumineous** (10): When I first heard this, I immediately thought, ""This would be a sick track for a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon water dungeon."" Or Strad from Minecraft Volume Beta.

**bespectacIed** (10): Only cxh will make a song with a trop pop beat in 2020 that I'll actually like

**conceptualromance** (10): The post chorus is just ????

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is leaving early and i’ve have not accepted it yet </3 it just feels like a lazy rainy sunday afternoon to me

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): This is such a sweet song both sonically and lyrically. I definitely appreciate it a lot as young woman who feels a lot of pressure and anxiety about the future.

**endcreditouilles** (10): the way they sing 'do it for the girrrrrllls all around the worrrrlllld' has me absolutely soaked

**ManofOranges** (10): I do hate the words ""baby girl"" one right after the other like that but for Chloe and Halle I will give it a pass.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is a great empowerment anthem, it's message feels really relatable and down to earth, not just a vague ""inspire people, you can do anything blah blah"". And the beat goes OFF

**ReallyCreative** (10): DO IT FOR THE GIRLS!!! ALL AROUND THE WORLD!!!

**Roxieloxie** (10): I know everyone’s go to video for this song is that really beautiful billboard one, which deserved. But i often think about this version that they shared on their instagram that a group of black women created and organized via zoom, I dont listen to this song alot but I think the timing of this song coming out in a really noticeable time of just how undervalued and under protected black women as a whole was at the forefront. The cry of 'do it for the girls' just really resonates with me/

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): :ascending: the music alone conveys dread and hope at the same time, it sounds as therapeutic as the lyrics are. Chloe is such an amazing producer. I love her and Halle for writing a song of care and compassion for themselves, and dedicating it to anyone feeling the same.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): beautiful lyrics, beautiful voices, beautiful production. when they into that deeper range in the chorus UGH

**LostintheCosmicFire** (9.5): going to do groceries while streaming this song during the pandemic, made me forget everything that was going around.Also don't be predictable and make a girl boss joke, this ain't future nostalgia

**wavingwolves** (9.3): love a song i don't need to turn off the feminist part of my brain to enjoy

**urfavgalpal** (9.2): a little more lowkey than some of the other tracks here.  I think it’s nice but it doesn’t get stuck in my head like the others

**bbfan132** (9): the live version of this is excellent

**ignitethephoenix** (9): As a girl I do appreciate this song a lot however I think it’s one of the weaker tracks on the album.

**Qustomar** (9): HEAVENLYYY

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): do it for the girl, do it for the girl, DO IT FOR THE CUTEST GIRL

**ktajlili** (8.5): can't tell if this is an eight or nine. This was an early favorite but I'm already getting tired of it. Still a bop though.

**seanderlust** (8.5): that hi baby girl video has caused that phrase to trigger my fight or flight response

**Vultuxe** (8.5): There is something missing from this song, and it's the chorus. It just doesn't hit as hard as I'd like it too. The rest is cute though.

**juanolsen** (8.3): the melody us really catchy and pleasant, i also like the concept of it

**afs** (8): Man their vocals are top notch. The snapping gets a bit annoying though.

**akanewasright** (8): This song is really nice to listen to, but I do generally consider it one of the weaker tracks on the album.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): You know Run the World? This is like, the legislative anthem of that reality.

**EnCaine** (8): love the production on this one

**engifear** (8): You heard it here first, ""Do It"" is for the girls

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): king if you play that fucking Brionna video and taint the good name of Chloe X Halle I s2g…

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): cXh just mopped with this song, they in fact did it for the girls

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Those drums are the best thing about this song, other than their voices of course. That post-chorus, though, ruins this song for me.

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): This is such a good ‘self love’ song. “Don’t you forget now, that little girl that you met now” is such a bar that I can forgive and forget any references to Casios

**Oberionsynth** (8): if I wasn't a Diet Man™ this song would def make me feel like an independent girl who don't need no man

**pig-serpent** (8): Some cool synths and rhythms, and the post-chorus really kicks the song up a notch, but even then I wish they made the end of the song go even harder.

**runaway3212** (8): this is just really really great, but it loses momentum towards the end

**salivantsonority** (8): The production is super interesting. Cute message.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): The production is my favorite part of this

**SupremeShani** (8): I consider this one of the weaker songs on Ungodly Hour, which just speaks volumes on how strong the album is. We stan an ambiguous feminist anthem.

**TiltControls** (8): hey baby girl

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): the hook is great

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): Soooooo catchy and groovy. The lyrics are great, the production is immaculate and (like always lol) they knock the vocals out of the park

**waluigiest** (8): do it for her (that is to say you’ll do it for him)

**liberalitea** (7.5): this one is slower and a bit more one note but I still really like it. their vocals are so smooth !!

# My video for Carly and Charli for our Day 1

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): god they harmonize so well. Wish this had a little more oomph tho

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): Closest thing to filler on this stacked album

**rickikardashian** (7.5): Hi baby girl hehe. Everything's okay, I promise. I forgive you. It's okay, don't worry about it. Everything's gonna be okay. I love you. I love you so much. I love you more than there are grains of sand, on every beach, of every planet, of every galaxy of the universe. I-I need you in my life. I need you more than humans need water, and food to survive. You mean more to me than - home depot means to Mr Ladrado. You mean more to me than just anything. You mean more to me than gold and diamonds, mean to the greediest burglar. And you're just the most perfect, most beautiful girl in all of the world, and I love you so much. I hope you enjoy watching this, baby girl kiss, hehe. See you at school tomorrow baby girl. I love you \*raises eyebrows*, hehe. I do, it's true. I love you more than anything else in the world hehehe. Bye baby girl. Stay perfect. Just for me.

**1998tweety** (7): cute, feels fillery tho

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I love the lyrics to this and especially the prechorus. I just think the post chorus sounds a little clunky.

**frogaranaman** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f_ec37PXNQ

**iniekcja\_** (7): this never really goes anywhere for me

**jaztinax** (7): a vibe although one of the weaker songs in here imo

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): One of the more forgettable tracks on this album, but still, beautiful harmonies from these two

**musical\_pyn** (7): the chorus isn't a strong as the rest of the song, but the harmonies are so smoooth

**throwaway7650** (7): the vocals are great but I'm not big on this song

**wasian-invasion** (7): is it just me or are there like owl hoots alternating between ears in my headphones? really distracting lol

Another song that made very little impression of me before the rate but significantly grew on me as I heard it more. This really is a lvoely carefree bop. While I think it is slightly upstaged by other power pop songs on the record like TLIC, Stay Away and Summer Love, it is very cute for what it is! Solo/So low is also far from original but Carly makes me not care in the slightest

---

# Happy being solo

**CritneySpearz** (11): queen of giving the single gays bops, who needs a man when you can just listen to Solo ??

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The continuation of Party For One

**bespectacIed** (10): life-affirming

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): She and Jason Derulo should collab.

**bulforster** (10): The bop Stay Away thinks it is.

**camerinian** (10): I need to be honest, I think this is the only song on Side B that really stands up with the best of Dedicated. The massive life-affirming chorus is so godly

**CarlieScion** (10): in the verses Carly sings about the «you»-character breaking up with someone with «he»-pronouns, while the chorus she sings «she moved on». This makes Solo a bisexual anthem and in this essay I will…

**CrimsonROSET** (10): THANK YOU! So many songs about people being sad they’re not in relationships, and they seem to just not understand that people can still be happy and single? Like that’s so much energy based on someone else, go enjoy your time! Go enjoy you, dammit!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): 322

**fenellabeach** (10): pop perfection, finally, thank you Carly

**liberalitea** (10): this song is so euphoric

**mudkip1** (10): WHY IS THIS WHOLE ALBUM GREAT

**musical\_pyn** (10): I will always stan a so low/solo rhyme

**nick1372** (10): this one took a while to sink in for me but I think it’s actually better than Party for One. Carly is the only person on the planet allowed to rhyme “solo” with “so low” by the way.

**nootnoot781** (10): SO WHAT YOU’RE NOT IN LOVE. i love a day 3 CRJ song. this is day 3 right? …right?

**runaway3212** (10): An incredible bop

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is my favorite song on the album and it may or may not be because I have been solo for at least a year at this point

**thedoctordances1940** (10): it's just so. fucking. good.

**TiltControls** (10): another fun bop!

**vagenda** (10): Rhyming “so low” with “solo”, do wonders never cease

**zagreux** (10): carly saying ""you'll be alright"" gives me so much serotonin aah

**1998tweety** (9.5): mega bop

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): so what, you're not in love? you shine bright by yourself dancing, homo ??

**iniekcja\_** (9.5): now this is DANCEABLE

**savemeaseat143** (9.2): a song for the singletons

**shhhneak** (9.2): SO WHAT YOU’RE NOT IN LOVE

**bbfan132** (9): super infectious, enjoyed this a lot

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): If this album had come out while *Glee* was still airing they could have used this song after a Finchel breakup and reframed it as being about Rachel pushing through her sadness by getting more solos in Glee Club.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): She rhymes ""so low"" with ""solo"". One might say this is uninspiring, but I think it is brilliant!

**jasannn** (9): I don't know if it just because I've been single for so long but this hits hard.

**just\_thonking** (9): I know it's generic but it's also so comforting, and the fact that she added it to the album last minute because she knew people were isolated is just so <3

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): Side B here really ramps up here at the end, and this bop is everything I want from Carly. It's not memorable in that I don't think of it, but then I play it and go ""oh right that's the song that's sometimes in my dead""

**salivantsonority** (9): I wanna dance with someone cute to this song. I love the invocation of her higher register. Super fun.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Why do I genuinely not remember this song it’s a bop

**SupremeShani** (9): Giving this a high score purely on the fact that I am lonely and pretend Carly is personally singing this to me.

**wavingwolves** (8.9): carly: being single is okay not all of us can get sumn!

**juanolsen** (8.7): another great song to add to the list of songs named solo

**Palutzel** (8.7): SINGLE BOP

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): this song is so fun. I don’t even have much to say about it but I like it a whole lot

**cashewconstellation** (8.4): see i usually slander this song, most commonly calling it a PG-13 Party For One but it's actually kinda hitting

**urfavgalpal** (8.4): This is like Party for One Part 2 and I really like it!  I have to say one thing I think Carly and her producers did well this album is capturing you from the first notes and this is one of those songs that does that.  I really like when Carly does songs that don’t center romantic love.  I mean those are all great but it’s nice to have a change of pace sometimes

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.1): Party for one, you dance by your phone, it don't have to be lonely being alone

**Alumineous** (8): The chorus kinda brought the song down for me. Also, her vocals at the end! Color me shocked.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Jennie is shaking. Bichi naneun solo.

**frogaranaman** (8): the final chorus lawddddddd

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): ok this song just itches my brain

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): Okay I can get into this – I truly don’t dislike this album (even if my other ratings beg to differ) but this really is just a collection of poppy songs instead a cohesive project, so it kind of feels like I’m just giving brownie points to CRJ when a song actually stands out to me in this jumbled compilation.

**pig-serpent** (8): The drop is pretty cool and I like the bells riff in the verses.

**Roxieloxie** (8): ,7 Listening to this song while being in the middle of a deep sadness episode sure is something, i can tell you that

**SmileAndTears** (8): This song used to be my shit but idk, it got old really fast. But then again this is really hitting hard atm so idk I'm kinda torn

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): what a fun bop, those ad libs at the ed

**welcome2thejam** (8): Solo / So low? Poetic Cinema.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): she’s cute

**astrologicalangel** (7.5): this high notes in the back were freaking perfection

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): ok… this is pretty boppy

# these scores are so low

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Not a bad one but definitely one of the songs in the tracklist that just smells like a leftover from Dedicated.

**conceptualromance** (7.5): kinda forgettable

**hikkaru** (7.5): this kinda sounds like an edm collab but it does bop a bit

**throwaway7650** (7.5): another song saved by the chorus

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): she just spent all this album talking about being in love and now she's like oh boohoo stop crying about being forever alone youre harshing my mellow

**afs** (7): And now she tackles house! Don't like those strange sounds post chorus but at least it's not like Windows.

**cremeebrulee** (7): its fine but the other “dont be sad about being single ur so sexy haha xx” song in this rate outsold

**waluigiest** (7): if I see one of the men who broke carly’s heart..... it’s on sight julien or whoever tf

**jman457** (6.9): Its pure blissful pop, but im not gonna act like there a million pop songs that sound just like it

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Anthem to wine moms everywhere

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): I feel like I say this for at least one song per rate, but it sounds like a eurovision song

**engifear** (6): The production is a bit cheesy sometimes, but it's still a fun song.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): sure

**J\_Toe** (6): was expecting something along the lines of Solo by Frank Ocean

**ManofOranges** (6): How many songs about masturbation is Carly gonna make?

**NotWith10000Men** (6): is this album over yet

**Oberionsynth** (6): can people stop trying to convince me that it's ok to be alone, pls i just want some d*ck stop making me feel like it's some kind of self hate

**poptartchill** (6): the ""solo"" wordplay is fun but generally I'm not super into this one

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): Similar lyrical content as Party For One but not as good imo. Feels a little dated actually? And not in the good retro way her songs usually do

**Vultuxe** (6): The production is off, but the hook is catchy. Probably the only real filler on here.

**Stryxen** (5.8): ok and

**anothertown** (5): got me plannin to go… solo...

**KennyEarthman** (5): Jennie outsold",Awkward_King,,3,3,2021-05-29 19:28:05

It's no Run Away With Me, but I don't think anyone is expecting Carly to top a song like that. And if you are, maybe lower your expectations. This is just a lovely piece of classic euphoric pop fun! And it's what Carly does best, and she doesn't pretend it is anything more than that and that lane she has carved is perfect for her. But Carly, please, why is this the only video for the era. You're killing me out here I have nothing to play in BeatSense.

# gay

**shhhneak** (11): Burning my 11 on this praying it gets to day 3. This is just classic CRJ boppery. It may actually be one of her best songs? Not even surprised she buried this gem on a b-side.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Carly will never not make insanely memorable openers.

**Alumineous** (10): Fuck it, I'm giving it a 10. I gave it a 6 initially because I wasn't getting the childish vocals. Like, I would give both When I Needed You a 0 with zero regrets. But the song grew on me. If that is her vocals in the beginning... I am shocked. The chorus just makes you want to scream it from your... window.

**hikkaru** (10): idc if it's the now that i found you of side b it bops and it bops more than anything else on this project

**IIIHenryIII** (10): This love isn't crazy, but THIS SONG IS INSANE! It's one of my top 5 songs of last year and my favorite Carly song ever (sorry Gimmie Love).

**iniekcja\_** (10): this song absolutely is crazy though

**ManofOranges** (10): She's an icon, she's got a point, and she is the moment, now cmon now.

**mudkip1** (10): maybe her best song ever???? a concept

**nick1372** (10): Carly remakes Run Away With Me and what, I’m supposed to not give it a 10?

**nooodisaster** (10): The fastest I've ever fallen in love with a song; literally by second 2 I knew this was 10/10 and it still is today. My favorite song on either Dedicated. This is sonic euphoria crafted from the hands of two literal music geniuses, and deserves everything in this world. Almost got my 11.

**pros-and-connors** (10): if you don’t like this song you hate love

**savemeaseat143** (10): hopeful love bop

**skargardin** (10): what a slapper

**slimboyfriend** (10): This song is the second coming of Run Away With Me and I don't understand why nobody else is paying attention to this

**throwaway7650** (10): my favorite on this album! hope it makes day 3

**TiltControls** (10): the most fun I've had listening to a carly song in a long time (and I love Carly)

**vagenda** (10): MY song of the summer 2020

**urfavgalpal** (9.9): Someone on popheads when the album came out said this was comparable to Run Away with Me and I remember when I first listened to the album thinking that person was dead wrong but actually I really agree with that.  It’s definitely a grower in my opinion but this has great lyrics, a great melody, and makes you feel.  I sing this song to my dog a lot which is a sign that it’s become One of My Favorites.  I don’t think she likes it but I don’t think that’s Carly’s fault.

**Dekubaku** (9.3): This love may not be crazy but the song is sure crazily fun!

**wavingwolves** (9.3): the millennial whoo whoo

**artzpop** (9.2): This song has such a spring feeling and the start is so euphoric I love it, always puts me in a good mood

**1998tweety** (9): big bop

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Kind of a formula we have heard at this point but hard not to love this track for all blissful and climactic and kind of powerful it is.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): lol I remember a snippet of this being posted by Carly in like... early 2018 I think (definitely well before Party For One) and I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever heard (it was just the hook). In reality it's really good but not the show stopper I thought it'd be

**just\_thonking** (9): Honestly I was underwhelmed by it on first listen but I quickly realized how this song is just pure joy

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): This is the most Emotion-sounding bop of the entire Dedicated extended universe

**liberalitea** (9): I love this song, it's so bright and fun

**pat-rickstar** (9): This is better than I remembered

**pig-serpent** (9): Great summer jam that feels like bliss, and has a nice smattering of synthwave elements that are used in a unique way too!

**salivantsonority** (9): Just a joyous, summery track. I want to go rollerskating to this song.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): this song feels like it belongs on the final dancing scene/credits of The Princess Diaries

**vayyiqra** (9): Peak Carly vibes, a very cute opener.

**fenellabeach** (8.9): gave me overly high hopes for this album

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): that tropical house production is entirely too musty for this song to work as well as it does. those ""ooh ooh""s ??

**notarobot3675** (8.8): such a fun opener

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): What a way to open this album. I need to hear more CRJ x Jack Antonoff collabs.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): such a great intro track to Side B and i love the vocal production on this

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): Loveeee Carly’s Robyn era. Continues Carly’s excellent track record of delivering immaculate opening tracks

**Vromega** (8.5): She's kinda forcing her voice here but I really like the instrumentation, the different sonorities slowly coming one by one to invite us to her album. A good entrance to this album.

**jman457** (8.4): Sure she isnt re-inventing the wheel with her music here, but its a fun synth pop album so what can you ask more from miss Carly

**ReallyCreative** (8.4): easily the weakest of Carly's ""anthems"" but it's still fun and cute

**Roxieloxie** (8.2): camilia talking to shawn when they left that sushi shop:

**afs** (8): This track is so happy I feel there's some sort of drug involved. But it's a good one!

**bbfan132** (8): some of the production choices were misses for me but i still enjoyed this quite a bit

**CarlieScion** (8): baby!!!!!! We could believe that!!!!!

**cashewconstellation** (8): this song grew on me during the past year, i like it, it's fun!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the backing vocals are a bit iffy but i love everything else

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): Ahh this one is going on the summer playlist. If it’s one thing Carly’s gonna do, it’s make carefree tunes

**juanolsen** (8): cute bop to open the album with

**Oberionsynth** (8): carly's a little too bubbly for me sometimes (also me being a kpop girl group stan, make it make sense), but this song is a WHOLE bop, like i feel so happy just hearing it

**runaway3212** (8): I did an writeup for the popheads top 100 for this song, but after that I realized I actually don't love this song that much

**targetguest** (8): I don't have the same love for this song that everyone else does, but a bop regardless

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): this and comeback is really the only decent scraps we have here huh

**waluigiest** (8): it’s cute and I like her little whoops

**wasian-invasion** (8): decent opener but the hook is kinda awkward. This love isn't crazy? ok cool what is it then

**bulforster** (7.9): It's our right to tank this album.

**hakkerj** (7.5): The vocals OKAY

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this does bop but her vocals are annoying on here at points

**Palutzel** (7.5): not crazy about this one

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): it's ok

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It's a really good song but ever so slightly annoying, this doesn't feel like a song I'd want to listen to on repeat.

**akanewasright** (7): Cute opener, but like... not one of her best or anything

**anothertown** (7): we love Kiss (2012) castoffs here

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): her voice is bright and full and fun.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is the “Party For One” of the album… like it’s not offensive or anything but it didn’t need to be the first thing that I heard from this release.

**poptartchill** (7): not SUPER crazy (ha) about the middle but overall it's pretty good

**rosecoloreds** (7): i'm not that crazy about this song but i'll let it play in the background while i clean my room

**SupremeShani** (7): An acceptable pop song, which perfectly represents what Dedicated Side B is about. There's peaks and dips in the production, it comes with that signature candid sweetness that Carly has mastered, but it rarely amounts to anything special.",Awkward_King,,3,3,2021-05-29 19:34:53

It's *so* epic I'll give it that, and I do appreciate the first minute of this until the first drop (I am, admittedly, not a fan of the drops, but I really appreciate how different it is). Idk maybe it'll hit different live. BUT, even if she isn't the first to do it, having the last track of the album represent an idea of shedding your snakeskin as you move on to your next step or next era is really simply elegant, and I love it for that.

# $10,000 via paypal

**BoneStreetSand** (11): This was the song that introduced me to Rina so it will always be special to me.

**fenellabeach** (11): no chance this will win overall but I couldn't not

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): This song left me speechless the first time I heard it. What an incredible album closer.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The power in this is immaculate.

**Alumineous** (10): That Final Fantasy sample, we love to see it.

**anothertown** (10): kafka once said we should read only things “which wound and stab us” which this song stabs me in the ass imo

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): I absolutely love when a closer feels like an ending and this is very much that

**bespectacIed** (10): ""Buy my expensive, exclusive, pain wear // My fine couture is your branded repayment"" those lines are so cunty, like wow

**conceptualromance** (10): The lyrics are so interesting on this one and I love the bass and the HORNS!

**cremeebrulee** (10): people hate this??? what?????

**CrimsonROSET** (10): We love a closer, AND it samples Final Fantasy! Gamer queen! This is gonna get so robbed, I already hate it.

**Dekubaku** (10): WOW!

**endcreditouilles** (10): gamers rise up the Final Fantasy beats have finally arrived

**fairytalehigh** (10): the way the serotonin floods my brain when the final fantasy sample hits ??

**frogaranaman** (10): this song is simply wild and very Good

**geraldinewww** (10): LOOOOKING FOR FORGIVENEEEESSSSSSS

**letsallpoo** (10): uncut anthem

**Oberionsynth** (10): the song that got me into Final Fantasy just bc of the sampling here, ugh her MIND

**plastichaxan** (10): imagine making an album with a perfect opener AND a perfect closer… her power

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): perfect song. that drop is so good it should be illegal. the stuttering vocals, the sexy vibes, the slave 4 u moment, i stan!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is the closest sonically to the RINA EP imo, and as such I adore it. The instrumental is rich, dramatic and fresh, that final fantasy melody interpreation is god-tier, and it's a fantastic closer. ""Buy my expensive, excluisve painwear"" lives rent-free in my mind

**skargardin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHx5hCVN26E

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this is also unfairly hated??? it fucking samples beethoven and final fantasy and you people hate this? the prechorus is so fucking hype?? it's bottom half of the album... easily.... but it's still super solid

**throwaway7650** (10): perfect album closer and will go out earlier than it should

**urfavgalpal** (10): yeah this fucking kills I mean Dynasty is the best album opener of the year and Snakeskin is the best album closer of the year.

**notarobot3675** (9.8): WHAT a closer

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.6): so lush and epic

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): A little bit of a chaotic closer, but you know, it still kind of slaps? Love just how the progression of the song goes, kind of mellow if tinged a little by drama, and then how it picks up the pace at certain points, with those bell hits, sombre piano and the Final Fantasy interpolations, it's such a strange track but it kind of works? It's also a great tie-in to the beginning where she says she has found the strength to overcome her struggles and begin anew, letting them be placed, cards on the table, for all to see. I kind of wish I knew what Rina's mom was saying over the final Sonata closing, though.

**iniekcja\_** (9.5): and this is THEE closer

**poptartchill** (9.5): Such a good closer! Very epic song

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): Yeah this is how you close out such a great album.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.5): The only problem I have with this song is that it isn’t 10 minutes longer

**juanolsen** (9.4): great way to close the album, absolutely cathartic and brings all the themes in the album to an end

**celladonn** (9.2): We stan the Final Fantasy victory music

**bbfan132** (9): such a fun outro, i love the drop in the middle

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): I I really like how she drags out words here.

**EnCaine** (9): i remembered not liking this one but it's great??

**engifear** (9): This is one of my favorite outros to an album

**liberalitea** (9): this is a great closer for the album and i love how it breaks down.

**nooodisaster** (9): You know what... this is a collapse. Again, the production here is just soooo good, it could carry the song on itself.

**oscarbrierley1** (9): thee bop

**pat-rickstar** (9): The chorus is a bit disappointing but the epic prechorus makes up for it

**TiltControls** (9): the FF victory adds at least 3 points onto this song

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): That FF sample tho

**just\_thonking** (8.5): This song is so creative, which makes the song before it come off as even more bland

**pheromenos** (8.5): idk, i don't like dialogues in songs, especially as outros. the song itself is an easy 9.5-10 tho.

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Not nearly as good as Dynasty but a great closer nonetheless

**SupremeShani** (8.5): As a closer to an truly amazing album, I think this song perfectly encapsulates what makes Rina such a dynamic figure in pop music. The way this dramatic track that starts off with a stripped down segment, that goes off into a manic breakdown with grand vocals, Final Fantasy samples, and hushed clapping shows that Rina Sawayama really is the moment.

**jman457** (8.4): feels very full circle with Dynasty so its only appropriate for it to get the same score

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): As Rina is finished tackling key moments in her life in this album, this song feels like an appropriate closer. I like how she explained that this entire album is her ""snakeskin"" and now that she is done talking, she has shredded it off and it's now in the hands of the fans, listeners, and critics.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is really the “Lingerie” of *Sawayama*, a closer that’s unexpected and kinda a disappointment when you first listen to it but after a while you understand why she did it. After everything that we’ve heard before she had to leave us with a battle cry, and “Snakeskin” is a promise that she’s always going to keep pushing and changing,

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): I actually love this song, just never such it would be my pick for album closer

**ktajlili** (8): I love the metaphor about shedding family trauma like a ""snakeskin."" This is a great closer.

**lolcevan** (8): there’s so much to process here

**musical\_pyn** (8): FINAL FANTASY GANG RISE UP

**seanderlust** (8): the interpolation of the FF victory theme? the beethoven sample? I am scalped. my only complaint is that the chorus can feel a bit anti-climactic

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This is probably my least favorite on the album even though I’m scoring it the same as another song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): honestly the best way to describe this is interesting but a GOOD interesting

**Vultuxe** (8): Finally and interesting song, weird EDM vibes with a drop but nonetheless it's welcome after the last few songs.

**wasian-invasion** (8): all i can think of is the ""i'm shedding my shedding my shedding my FORESKIN!"" tweet

**welcome2thejam** (8): Rina used Final Fantasy victory theme reference! Critical hit! Rina has gained 420 exp. points! Snakeskin has gained a level (Lvl. 8)!

**cashewconstellation** (7.6): i used to skip this but it's good now

**camerinian** (7.5): the Final Fantasy sample ugh her mind

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.5): this song needed to be like at least one verse longer, but I love closing songs that literally sound like they’re winding down. I literally just imagine someone running down a dark swirly staircase lol

**Itsafudgingstick** (7.5): Hiss hiss motherfucker

**1998tweety** (7): shes alright, we love final fantasy tho

**CarlieScion** (7): a cute lil moment

While it may not be Rina's most innovative subject matter compared to the generational trauma, anti-capitalist and immigrant experience themed songs, it fuckin bops. Her exploration into 90s R&B here is very appreciated, and it would be even more appreciated if we got a remix of it with Tinashe like I have spent the past 13 months manifesting (swifties that is not a Taylor hint **do not engage**).

**Tedyonce** (11): NEW JACK SWING REVIVAL 2021 PLZ

**afs** (10): I think I've made it clear how much I adore 80s synthpop. But that electric guitar solo... whew.

**akanewasright** (10): Can’t relate, but I do love me some 90’s R&B pop

**Alumineous** (10): I can't explain why I like this song so much. It just immediately grabbed me.

**bespectacIed** (10): It's easy to scoff at self-love songs but I will always be grateful and tolerant of em. I love the cheese. P.S. Rina doesn't frack and isn't transphobic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): She really said said let me bring back New Jack Swing real quick. This song makes me want to dance more than any other on the album which is saying a lot.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): you know when a song just hits you in an unexpected way? This was that. Fuck beauty standarts.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fun funky

**juanolsen** (10): as always rina is great at instrospective lyrics, the whole song is great but I really love the chorus

**KennyEarthman** (10): has a skating rink at night vibe

**ManofOranges** (10): As clichéd as the message is, she's absolutely right and she should say it!!

**Qustomar** (10): Love this New Jack Swing moment yum!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is basically an Utada Hikaru song, not that I'm complaining, Utada is a goddess

**ReallyCreative** (10): this feels like one of the more RINA tracks on the album, and it's presence is a nice break from some of the more intense stuff on the front half of the album

**runaway3212** (10): more like love me 10 me

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Rina has RuPaul quaking in his Klein Epstein & Parker boots

**skargardin** (10): underrated!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the fact this was almost left off the album (and seeing how the bonus tracks are so much worse than it) is like.. shocking. thank god. this song is amazing.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): Love the lyrical content of this one, she’s like CDG’s sensitive little sister and the rhythmic quality it has is so so sooooo good

**wavingwolves** (10): my answer is: i will never love anyone ever, not even myself, that's all!

**welcometoNY** (10): can i get an amen

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.9): without the guitar solo it would be much lower but the guitar solo is hot

**urfavgalpal** (9.9): RuPaul could never!  Honestly this would be a 10 if it weren’t for the fact that the “if you can’t love yourself” bit takes me out because it reminds me of RuPaul. I love it though.

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): As far as self-loving anthems go, this is pretty high up there. If you’re reading this, the only one you should be comparing yourself to is yourself. Try to do better than you did yesterday, don’t be too hard on yourself and stay awesome. Bye.

**bulforster** (9.5): The first verse is weak but it's great when it gets into the (new jack) swing of things.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): A panromantic anthem

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): One of the better self love anthems

**bbfan132** (9): the best song from the 90s that was released in 2020

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Loving myself has been a difficult, conflicting journey as I have barely high self-esteem of myself. If I display my self-confidence, I get scared that I might look egoistic. This is such an empowering song from Rina and I highly appreciate it.

**nick1372** (9): woo!

**Oberionsynth** (9): this song makes me feel like i'm watching the dan and phil pastel cooking videos and I'm obsessed with that

**seanderlust** (9): the late 90s vibes on this are impeccable. also rina guest judge on drag race when

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This song is just so boppy!!

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): love the message here but i feel like the verses are too short

**1998tweety** (8.5): cute

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): PLEASE let us bring back teen pop! I'm asking politely

**jasannn** (8.5): Who needs a bridge when you have an amazing guitar solo that is just as cathartic?

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): Wholesome Bop

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): This song might get robbed but I think its really sweet!!

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): pretty standard self love stuff, but the production has all these fun bits and that guitar solo kills

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Can I get an Amen up in here?

**J\_Toe** (8): This is the track that most reminds me of her 2017 EP RINA, in how Y2K it sounds.

**musical\_pyn** (8): more like 8 years hahaha wait fuck this isn't even the right album

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): i want a more developed version of this sound from her, but it's still a bop

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): another one that is pure fun

**vayyiqra** (8): This is so early 90s. It's a jam.

**jman457** (7.7): 90’s throwback for this song was an excellent idea

**engifear** (7): I would love to hear the original New Jack Swing version of the song

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): the verses on this song went to the Ariana grande school of enunciation but the guitar pulls this song together

# :i_kendricklamar:

**savemeaseat143** (8.3): I don't like that particular quote

**Dekubaku** (8): Not a bad song at all. But compared to the other tracks in the album, I felt like it paled a bit.

**ktajlili** (8): I loved this one for a while, but I'm kind of over it. Still a bop though. I relate the theme of being at odds with your parents.

**throwaway7650** (8): one of my ""least favorites"" (as an 8 lol) but good message

**salivantsonority** (7.7): Forgot about this song. Good, but not incredible.

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): In most other albums this would be a cool kind of rock-inspired pop song about self-acceptance that I think would work for anyone. In the tracklisting though I kind of find this a little bit too muted, a bit too tame for Rina's standards. Nothing much else to say.

**liberalitea** (7.5): I think this is one of the weaker tracks on the album, but it's still great! just falls a little flat compared to the rest.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): RuPaul co-wrote this.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): It's forgettable, but it's a good song, though.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): This is good but kind of forgettable - sounds like an NSYNC B-side

**NotWith10000Men** (7): feels like comme des garcons' sister

**pat-rickstar** (7): This is a bop but I never really cared for it as much as other songs here, it has a nice message but it's not a key part of the album's story to me

**waluigiest** (7): it’s got some nice jammy moments and the guitar bridge is nice

**Stryxen** (6.9): i love all my sawayama tracks equally. Earlier that day: i don’t care for love me 4 me

**nooodisaster** (6.5): The simplest song on here, but it's pure.

**poptartchill** (6.5): is it a bad song? No! But it is my least favorite.

**frogaranaman** (6): haha get it love me ‘4’ me

**SupremeShani** (6): The song does get points from me by somehow avoiding being overly saccharine that typically plagues self empowerment anthems, and the fact that Rina can have a New Jack Swing inspired song like this alongside nu-metal and bubblegum pop just speaks volumes about her range. I just don't really connect with it all that much.

**fenellabeach** (5.6): the rupaul quote brought it right down

**oscarbrierley1** (5): ru paul could never, if u can't frack yourself, who can u frack

**Vultuxe** (5): Seemed really generic to me, and I think I don't like her voice enough to appreciate the ""generic"" kind of pop songs.

**plastichaxan** (4): i'm sorry but she's not on the level of these girlies

**pig-serpent** (3): This one's pretty bland.",Awkward_King,,3,3,2021-05-29 20:25:39

This is honestly my favourite of the three CxH bonus tracks so I'm very sad it's the first out of them, it's so smooth and they just sound so good. I really like the clicks in the instrumentation, and clicks in music I usually find to be quite tacky so I'm happy they work here. The two of them also obviously sound absolutely amazing together on it.

# love RECEIVED

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THE VOCALS

**Alumineous** (10): Transcendent. Vocals could be brought a bit further forward. But besides that, the vocals are on point and just exquisitely made. I never listened to the original, so take that what you will.

**fadedblue09** (10): A serve!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I hadn’t heard this before… thank you I owe you my life

**liberalitea** (9): their vocals are just so good

**runaway3212** (9): the song is good but the cover art??? bad

**skargardin** (9): vocals

**SupremeShani** (9): chloe and halle can cover literally anything, call it oversinging or whatever but it's always on point, harmonies tighter than bebe rexhar's budget

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): What a perfect choice for them. The production is perfect and, as per usual, the vocals are flawless

**waluigiest** (9): their voices are especially tight and beautiful

THIS IS SUCH A FUCKING GOOD CLOSER I'M SO SORRY, one of my absolute favourites from the album. It's almost nothing like anything else from the album and yet feels to really wrap the project up well. I like the hook line of it, ""won't you live tonight (like the rest of your life)"", I like it as in after we've just danced and cried through this whole album that we can hold our head up and go 'alright there's still a whole night ahead of us, let's make the fucking most of it'

---

# yes we WILL live tonight like the rest of our lives

**akanewasright** (10): Everything about this song BANGS

**amiriteor** (10): would be another 11

**bespectacIed** (10): smash

**conceptualromance** (10): love the way they sing this one

**CrimsonROSET** (10): for the rest of my life? I mean why not

**CritneySpearz** (10): honestly perfect way to end the album

**frogaranaman** (10): underrated

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’ve heard this song described as “Disney Channel” and that’s a compliment bitch

**hakkerj** (10): This song goes HARD

**IIIHenryIII** (10): That's a ten, with no doubt! It's perfect!

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (10): Ending the album on an absolute BANGER

**nootnoot781** (10): nah the hate this song gets in unwarranted, monarchs rise up!!!

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this chorus is like crack to me

**plastichaxan** (10): underrated

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): i want more of this nu-metal sound from them. I want more of this raw, angry, almost cocky sound from them. I think that they've created something in this track that is very different, and it's just so interesting to listen to because it's so relatively out there. I think this is a good natural evolution of their sound from their first album to here, and it's just such a good song.

**ReallyCreative** (10): rolling on the yloor laughing

**Roxieloxie** (10): The live version of this FUCKS SO HARD but im also just obsessed with it in general

**salivantsonority** (10): Absolutely magnificent bop; I'm also just a sucker for this vibe of track.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i personally think this is a great closer and encapsulates the essence of the album

**Uberpigeon** (10): I think this is the most under appreciated song on the album. The production is so cool and fresh and the song has this scary haunting vibe. It makes for a great closer (ft. halsey)

**waluigiest** (10): it’s crunchy and weird and I’m obsessed with it

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): ; if I could give more than one 11...

**artzpop** (9.5): I WILL live tonight and for the rest of my life

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): youknowyouknowyouknow this track fine like that

**SupremeShani** (9.5): Okay, I honestly have no idea why the song is titled like this, but hey, hey, why don't you come on my wave now?

**urfavgalpal** (9.3): I think I really underrate this song tbh. Cause almost every time I listen to the album I’m taken back by how good this song is

**EnCaine** (9.1): giving this a +0.1 so i can nudge it just above do it and tipsy. it feels right. this is a total banger

**anothertown** (9): this sounds like MIA

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): so underrated and bombastic literally a perfect ending

**jman457** (9): I really fuck with this, it kind of reminds me of home with you by Fka twigs though

**juanolsen** (9): great way to close the album

**Oberionsynth** (9): ""yolo"" found dead in a ditch, ""royl"" is my favorite acronym now

**vayyiqra** (9): This is a very interesting melody and wholesome concept. A good closer.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): the chorus on this feels so heavenly

**ktajlili** (8): bop city

**bbfan132** (7.5): fun outro!!!

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.5): I like the wordplay in this one

# people put a lot of stock into the album closer huh

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): After such a strong run of songs this one kind of falls a little flat, especially as a closer

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It's a good song but Wonder What She Thinks Of Me should have been the closer and I feel like this suffers a bit coming after that

**1998tweety** (7): i dont really care for this sorry, its not bad though

**astrologicalangel** (7): just a little too repetitive

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): It was like this year I figured out what ROYL stood for, whoops. I don’t like the chorus of voices that much even if I like the idea of them. I like the lower voices here and it’s a good wrap up of the album

**jasannn** (7): .

**KennyEarthman** (7): just found out that ROYL stands for Rest of Your Life and not Royal or smth

**martian\_pet** (7): i like it but dont get the hype

**nick1372** (7): hey hey

**pig-serpent** (7): I appreciate how different this song sounds from the rest of the album.

**wasian-invasion** (7): kinda underwhelming for the last track tbh

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): A pretty lukewarm finish to the album tbh, I do like the choral vocals and again, not bad at all, but still pretty underwhelming compared to the first half.

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Rolling on the Yoor Laughing

**throwaway7650** (6.5): it's not a skip but I don't really feel anything about this song, kind of a weak note to end the album on unfortunately. anyway stream hazy

**afs** (6): More hip-hop with some strange things going on. Peculiar closer.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Beyonce is speaking through them. I'm not crazy about it but I get the appeal.

**Leixander** (6): gets a bit annoying with the repetition (ironic coming from a charli fan heh)

**Stryxen** (6): why did this actually make me laugh

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): A pretty good song, but the verses aren’t that great...

**Vromega** (6): awful instrumentation and lazy production. At least their gorgeous vocals remain

**fadedblue09** (5): Doesn't really do justice as a closing track. Feels unnecessarily ominous for some reason.

**zagreux** (5): this was kinda underwhelming as a final track

**ImADudeDuh** (4): why do most of the closers this rate suck

**SmileAndTears** (4): Didn't dig too deep into the lyrics so I'm probably missing something but what a weird song to close your with

**Vultuxe** (0): Honestly, it physical hurts how bad this is, there is nothing redeemable to me, it sounds totally different than the rest of the album. Sorry.

# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT2_F-1esPk

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a perfect closer

**Alumineous** (10): They made up for the horrible intro with a dope-ass closer. Love this one.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): 10YL, stellar closer!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a glorious, fun and great closer

**runaway3212** (10): the best closer of this rate

**wavingwolves** (9.8): this is actually such a perfect closer to this marvellous album

**pat-rickstar** (9.7): Awesome closer

**fairytalehigh** (9.4): they stick the fucking landing on this one, what a great closer! the chorus is one of their best

**CarlieScion** (9): a good closer!!!!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This is an amazing closer to this perfectly consistent album. This closer alone made me curious to check out their debut album which Chloe said that this song is a callback to their humble beginnings. I'll definitely check it out.

**liberalitea** (9): this is a great closer

**musical\_pyn** (9): great closer, I love the low chorus",Awkward_King,,3,3,2021-05-29 20:54:32

Those blaring synths in the intro my god they're so good. Fun fact, I legitimately didn't know this and Felt This Way were lyrically almost identical until actual months after Side B came out and I saw someone mention it in a thread talking about something like this and was like ""...huh"". But alas, there goes Carly's second top song, I'm still quite surprised at how much Comeback and This Love Isn't Crazy flopped, but I never really doubted Summer Love would be the top. Here's to hoping it lasts a little while longer!!!

# Stay Away Supremacy

**cashewconstellation** (11): this song can best be described as an euphoric explosion, just AAAAAAAAAAAAA, the ""touch. Touch. TOUCH ME"" PART? HDSHSDAJDSA

**1998tweety** (10): the better of the 2, this song bops so hard

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It’s amazing how this continues the story right after Felt This Way, only Carly Rae Jepsen queen of the swords could do this.

**bespectacIed** (10): The pussy popping drug sniffing sister of Felt This Way that I equally love

**conceptualromance** (10): this is the superior version imo. The production supports the urgency/intensity of the lyrics much better

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): this song is a gay banger and a half omfg I love it

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Carly was like, ""so you like Felt This Way, um? Let me just change the arrangement and some of the lyrics to make it a total bop"" She's one of a very short list of artists who could do this perfectly!

**iniekcja\_** (10): pop goddess yes!

**KennyEarthman** (10): I'm a sucker for pop song like this

**ManofOranges** (10): The more exciting companion to Felt This Way and delicious to the ear all the same.

**ReallyCreative** (10): I am obsessed with this song, it is just Carly doing what she does best. An absolute joyous bop.

**rickikardashian** (10): this and felt this way are brilliant idc idc

**seeyanever** (10): This is brilliant, don’t pretend it’s anything else. Carly’s mind? On a different level.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This one is the high energy sister who was valedictorian but also would go clubbing with you on a tuesday

**sirpancakeXI** (10): a better version of felt this way

**Turpamutteri** (10): bop

**vagenda** (10): An absolute gem of Carly’s discography and a sublime pairing with Felt This Way. Her releasing both of these songs back to back is one of my favourite moments on a pop album ever. People throw around the phrase “her mind” a lot but, truly, honestly, her mind

**vayyiqra** (10): This is a very well-produced song! Underrated.

**waluigiest** (10): WHEW when this starts right after Felt This Way I feel it. It dials the energy up and creates this totally desperate, explosive track. Amazing

**welcome2thejam** (10): The cooler Daniel.

**welcometoNY** (10): the prechorus is insanely good

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Queen of repurposing songs in a new and creative way

**zagreux** (10): dua take notes

**urfavgalpal** (9.8): I love love love this song especially the echoey-ness of it and the syncopation going on.  It’s a really fun track and one of my favorites on the album.  It’s of those songs that if I get it in my head I have to listen to it immediately and now I have to listen to it immediately

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): this song is Chanel #1 and Felt This way is Chanel #5

**jasannn** (9.5): An Indiehead comment during the popheads exchange: ""Omg, even the Carly song is horny.""

**nick1372** (9.5): It’s really not fair to not rate these as a packaged set, but they are both incredible in their own way

**Qustomar** (9.5): This feels like a very classic-style, CRJ pop perfection song. Doesn't make sense to me why this didn't open the album? The album doesn't feel like it truly begins until Stay Away.

**plastichaxan** (9.3): the best song in this album to say “stay away”

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): I love the chorus on this, definitely a step up from Felt This Way even if this vibe will be a little repetitive through the record

**afs** (9): lmao I was floored when I realised this was just a more fun and energetic version of the same lyrics of the previous track, normally I'd give it 8 but extra point for the clever idea

**bbfan132** (9): a summer bop!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): It took me a few listens but this goes so well with Felt This Way. Listening to them back to back is so satisfying.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): superior

**juanolsen** (9): paired with the previous song this demonstrates why Carly is a genius

**just\_thonking** (9): Love the felt this way/stay away duo. They are twins :)

**mudkip1** (9): the production in the verse sounds like the noise that lego bricks made when you built them in the video games

**nooodisaster** (9): Sexy, dynamic, this one is surfing out into the ocean and catching the wave that'll take you crashing to shore.

**runaway3212** (9): the beginning sounds like an ad

**thedoctordances1940** (9): ...you know something like this.

**Vromega** (9): In less than 15 seconds, stay away reveals itself to be the superior version. And then comes the chorus which is an absolute bop. Proud and confident voice, upbeat synth sounds, so many great elements on this song.

**Vultuxe** (9): A different song with the same lyrics as the one before it is obviously cute and quirky but that aside, Stay Away is a total banger, no complaints here.

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): That POP in the second prechorus is so fucking good, gives me an eargasm every time

**hakkerj** (8.7): the way I freaked out when I heard this song for the first time… HER MIND

**Palutzel** (8.6): felt this way's superior sister

**geraldinewww** (8.5): is it the same song as felt this way. yes. is it a bigger bop. also yes

**nootnoot781** (8.5): #teamstayaway

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.2): The way Carly repeatedly singing ""away"" is heaven to my ears.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): boppy

**akanewasright** (8): the bimbification of Felt This Way

**anothertown** (8): sorry i JUST realized that this and felt this way are the same song… that was not needed

**EnCaine** (8): this is like if the church from my TLIC comment covered Felt This Way and somehow it's increasing the score. they did have a single banger they would play sometimes so it makes sense

**hunnybee12** (8): the bright, full chorus makes the song interesting in comparison to felt this way

**jaztinax** (8): yeah i like this one better than felt this way

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): With bops like these....you're right Carly, I can't stay away

**poptartchill** (8): the first time I realized what she did was a mind blowing experience

**liberalitea** (7.5): i think i would've liked this more if it didn't come right after Felt This Way. Tracklist kind of ruined it for me because those 2 sort of blend together, but i do prefer this because the chorus is much better.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.1): it's an upgrade but like still kinda bland

**RandomHypnotica** (7): I appreciate this as the superior version of Felt This Way

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): definitely prefer this more hard-hitting track to Felt This Way

I WANNA BURN LIKE FIRE TONIGHT is so fucking addictive, a year and a half later this is still a fever dream of a collab, and I can't in the slightest imagine how this happened in some boardroom meeting somewhere, but I am sincerely glad it did. I know many people had this pegged as the winner of the bonus, which it was for a little very early on, but had just been falling ever since, and only *just* missed out on making Day 3 of the bonus.

# DO THE FUCKING VIDEO GAME VOCALS RATE

**1998tweety** (10): iconic, we need this on streaming

**akanewasright** (10): I wish this was on streaming woeis

**bookthieving** (10): unironically my favorite in the bonus rate

**Brendon-Urine** (10): iconic.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The fact this isn't on Spotify is a fucking crime. Nintendo when I catch you....just kidding that Mario theme park looks fucking cool. ;_;

**endcreditouilles** (10): the mario mashup makes this a perfect 10 i'm obsessed

**fairytalehigh** (10): frankly, this song's absence from streaming is fucking homophobic

**frogaranaman** (10): Nintendo put this on streaming challenge

**geraldinewww** (10): MARIO???? MARIO?????? HELLO?????????? i almost rated this an 8 until the mario theme kicked in. charli xcx for smash

**jackisboredtoday** (10): PLEASE PUT THIS ON STREAMING… even on iTunes I’d spend money to own it. Just let it be officially out, I want to own this song so badly

**jayjaysortagay** (10): gurl it was camp

**liberalitea** (10): this is such a fun bop!!!

**lolcevan** (10): this song is the best thing charli has ever been apart of

**pheromenos** (10): the way this is my highest-scored charli song in the rate lol

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Nintendo not only refusing to let this be put on streaming, but also removing it from YouTube is a hate crime

**runaway3212** (10): TOAD MAIN POP GIRL

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Charli + Nintendo is a fever dream combination that just works

**seanderlust** (10): gamers rise up!!

**targetguest** (10): literally not a joke I would listen to this before any song Indieheads sent us for the exchange rate

**TiltControls** (10): gamer queen

**vayyiqra** (10): The crossover we didn't know we needed. EDM peaked with this song. Am I being ironic right now? I'll never tell! (Okay maybe a little but it does bop.)

**welcome2thejam** (10): Charli Commits Tax Fraud

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Put it on Spotify challenge

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Invented Disney land

**amiriteor** (9): gold coins everywhere

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Outsold that flop “Electric,” fuck you Katy Perry this is how you make a song for a video game franchise

**hikkaru** (9): this is better than anything else galantis has made in the past few years and deserved to be on streaming i literally hate nintendo so much

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): idc that they invented the ds or wii or Mario kart whatever the best thing Nintendo has ever done is put Charli on a Mario song

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Oh, that's a banger! The drop was a bit disappointing; I was expecting it to go bigger after that build up. Well, it's my first time listening to it, so now I know what to expect.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): i want to fucking go so fucking bad

**LostintheCosmicFire** (9): I wonder how that song was made hahahha,this is pure serotonin

**racloves** (9): okay but I’ve seen videos of the land at universal Japan and it looks incredible I need to visit

**Roxieloxie** (9): honestly i just wanna now how they decided on getting charli for this. I dont know if i like this song or if i just really like mario and really want to go to super nintendo land

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Bop bop bop but the video is ruined for me because every time Corey from Big Brother 18 is on the screen I think “hey that’s Corey from Big Brother 18” and it takes me out of the magical Nintendo experience

**skargardin** (9): we love VGV rate promo

**SupremeShani** (9): super fucking mario, gaymers and their enteral obsession with nintendo found screaming

**bbfan132** (8.5): this unironically bops

**EnCaine** (8.5): luigi feat. charli xcx would be a world ending collab

**plastichaxan** (8.5): cuuute

**Vultuxe** (8.5): It's... good? It's actually really catchy. The lyrics are soulless but that's what promotional video game songs will be.

**Palutzel** (8.3): generic, but such a bop

**afs** (8): I wasn't expecting a Nintendo X Charli song. At all. But it's awfully fun albeit generic, and I'm into the Nintendo influence in it.

**astrologicalangel** (8): yes bitch

**oscarbrierley1** (8): cursed but great

**Raxxin** (8): giving this this score simply because of the mv

**throwaway7650** (8): omg I remember this coming out but I don't remember bopping to it... this is nice. love a good pop x gaming crossover

**waluigiest** (8): the idea of Charli recording this is very funny

**jsonphile** (7.5): what the hell is this and why do I actually kinda dig it

**notarobot3675** (7.5): this was super cute!

**celladonn** (7): Do the video game vocal rate

**ggal2020** (7): cue gaymer jokes

**martian\_pet** (7): cute ??::???,??::???

**musical\_pyn** (7): I love xcx world

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): It sends me that Mario is credited as a vocalist in the lyric video I watched

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Charli sampling Mario music walked so Post sampling the Ecruteak City theme could run

**bigbigbee** (6.5): It’s not BAD, but for a song about Mario, I feel like it lacks a lot of fun and creativity (until the original Mario theme comes in towards the end, but it’s too late). It just sounds like a mid 2010’s EDM song. Jump Up Superstar outsold HEAVILY.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): vgv rate impacT

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): omg i forgot this existed. something about charli and toad on peach's castle is extremely hilarious

**wavingwolves** (6.3): hey gaymers

# they targeted gamers

**jman457** (6.2): cute but also annoying

**jasannn** (6): Post Malone x Pokemon Collab outsold. This is just a basic edm song.

**KennyEarthman** (6): would play in the Super Mario movie trailer

**nootnoot781** (6): mario main pop girl

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6): this is so fucking stupid

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Oh I'm doing VGV rate already?

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): this song is a mess

**iniekcja\_** (5): this sounds like it would be used in a soda commercial on tv, the Mario adlibs are cool though

**kirby31200** (5): Jump Up Superstar this is not. Everyone involved could do better

**thedoctordances1940** (4): I know it's Nintendo promo but the mario sound effects just don't work at all and while the sample of Mario's theme isn't as bad, it still clashes instrumentally. At least the rest of the song is alright I guess.

**urfavgalpal** (3.4): no offense to charli but I think her voice sounds kinda bad here

**engifear** (3): This song already sounds dated

**pig-serpent** (3): I mean good for Charli for being asked to make this, but this doesn't capture what I like about her music. It kinda sucks.

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): this song is my worst nightmare.

I hated this song ?? And for what ?? Like I remember why I didn't like this song, I found the vocal melodies quite annoying and the rest of it kinda bland but it clicked at some point very early in scores coming in and I upped this from like a 3 to an 8. It's still far from my favourite but it's just so <333 sweet, and nice to hear.

---

# pb's ballot was overall rly good and this was no exception

**plvstvcbvrds** (11): okay so hear me out. this song made me cry the first time i heard it. as someone who lives alone and struggles with friendship because i'm mentally ill, this song was a balm for some pain i hadn't really dealt with. i think that it's just such a lovely song, and it won't go far in this rate, but i adore it. it's just like a warm hug of a song. 'i had to learn to love me lately' - and i like to think that i did.

# however they were lonely in giving this song their 11

**1998tweety** (10): holy shit this is amazing what the fuck im floating

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): “It don’t have to be lonely being alone” is a sentiment that took me a very long time to internalize and understand and it’s something that I still struggle with.

**Alumineous** (10): They brought my mood down with Overwhelmed and suddenly, I'm energized.

**bespectacIed** (10): Second best song on the album and my most played. The harmonies!!!

**conceptualromance** (10): I appreciate Chloe and Halle making a song for us lonely bitches

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I really like this song from the production and vocal layering to it’s message. I like to listen to it when I’m sad. Chloe’s vocals are particularly good here.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): It feels like Chloe and Halle are reaching out to me as my friends asking me if I am doing okay but through a song. I love this song so much because I have my moments of being lonely which I hate sometimes so I feel very seen with this song. Thank you so much Chloe and Halle for making this song because this song feels so therapeutic to me.

**fadedblue09** (10): Love the sensual, atmospheric vibe. The message of this hits a lot especially last year.

**fairytalehigh** (10): my favorite track on the album. it's warm, the beat knocks, the harmonies sparkle, the ""you don't have to be lonely being alone"" hook is perfect. i needed this in 2020

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): There’s so something interesting about hearing a song about loneliness sung by two people but it kinda makes sense because the song is, at its core, about how loneliness is often more a state of mind than a physical state; you can have other voices singing with you and not even hear them. As someone who struggles a lot with pushing people away out of apathy more than anything else this song really resonates with me and I hope y’all are kind to it.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): it don’t have to be lonely being alone is so simple but omg if that doesn’t hit

**ignitethephoenix** (10): me a single person in a pandemic taking in every word of this song. One of my personal favorite deep cuts here

**liberalitea** (10): one of the best deep cuts on this album and gets me emotional :(

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): this is still so underappreciated

**ReallyCreative** (10): their absolute best song, I get CHILLS listening to this song even a year later. The vocals, the production, the atmosphere! the energy they created in the studio could power the entire world for 50 years but the GP just doesn't care!

**Roxieloxie** (10): king hates this song but he's irrelevant so let me talk about it instead. this might be one of my top 5 songs on the album, they we're evil for this song 'who are you when no one's watching' 'arent you afraid of the silence , arent you scared of what you'll find in it' are you fucking kidding me, i want to cry. again the timing that this album came out, no longer being in a dorm room cause of covid and just the general anxiety that comes with living and being black and trying to have your coming of age era while at the same time having to be this huge social justice advocate and try and dismantle oppression. Its alot, and ive found myself just going to bed alot later , usually im the last person up and its literally feels like all my anxieties are choking me and holding me down. I just feel so lonely all the time and this song captures it in a way that i cant even bring myself to try and convey

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This song feels like a hug

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is my go to panic attack/depression song

**wavingwolves** (10): please close the sub if this doesn't make to day 3 when it's like the second best song on this album

**welcome2thejam** (10): Instantly hooked me in. Love the pacing of this! That first minute has such a killer momentum and doesn't let up throughout. Favorite song on the album, easily.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.7): self-sufficiency bop

**nick1372** (9.5): a banger in every sense of the word!!

**SupremeShani** (9.5): I know the themes of loneliness explored here aren't really unique or anything, but I feel like they captured the complexities of feeling alone here well enough that it hits hard enough emotionally. It's comforting, in a sad way, that makes this one of my favorites of the album.

**endcreditouilles** (9.4): everyone rise for the endcreditouilles national anthem

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): This song is just so pretty, all the layered vocal harmonies are gorgeous, it's a really chill, pleasant, relaxing track

**afs** (9): Finally something leaning more towards pop, and they nail it, with a little nitpick that the chorus starts off a little weak.

**akanewasright** (9): I didn’t used to like this song but like... it’s so soothing. I’ll be sad when this goes out day 1.

**cremeebrulee** (9): ended crj’s solo

**musical\_pyn** (9): the second best song about being alone in this rate

**NotWith10000Men** (9): ""it don't have to be lonely being alone"" queens speaking my language

**Raxxin** (9): too relatable...

**salivantsonority** (9): Groovy; I really, really like this track. Can imagine bumping it while cruising down the highway.

**SmileAndTears** (9): a cute moment

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): always gets stuck in my head for hours after i listen to it

**vayyiqra** (9): I wish this weren't relatable. :pensive:

**urfavgalpal** (8.7): I don’t ever hear people really talking about this one but it’s one of my favorites.  I really like Chloe and Halle.

**anothertown** (8.5): ??

**hakkerj** (8.5): This song brings back vivid memories of me driving to Dunkin to get my iced coffee at 10 AM during work hours.

**Itsafudgingstick** (8.5): They really wrote this song for the girlies going through it during quarantine huh

**kirby31200** (8.5): Don't be wasting your life getting sooooo low

**throwaway7650** (8.5): I love the ""it don't have to be lonely being alone"" line

**AHSWeeknd** (8): This hits harder when Halle posts those sad insta stories from her London hotel room

**bbfan132** (8): i like the production!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): The hook to this is so good but I do wish it had more of a substantial bridge.

**camerinian** (8): god these harmonies are just gorgeous

**CrimsonROSET** (8): WHY ARE ALL OF YOU CALLING ME OUT FOR BEING LONELY THIS IS LIKE THE THIRD RATE IN A ROW CAN I HAVE SOME ROOM TO BREATHE

**juanolsen** (8): i really forgot how this song sounded,ni find it cute but it's not a highlight for me

**Oberionsynth** (8): pls i'll just take anyone at this point, girlies where y'all at (lmao @ me taking a song ab ""it's ok to be lonely"" and using it to talk ab how desperate i am)

**oscarbrierley1** (8): obligatory me in lockdown comment

**seanderlust** (8): ""it don't have to be lonely being alone"" SPILL

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): I love the vulnerability of this section of the album. This is a bit chiller than the first half of the album but is just as catchy and ethereal

**zagreux** (8): relatable queens

**jman457** (7.7): Justin Bieber is shook

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): kinda funny how it follows Overwhelmed cause this one is pretty underwhelming

**just\_thonking** (7.5): ICarly theme song

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): sorry cant relate im never alone :)

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Not a bad song but again, kind of the same songwriting issues and lack of energy and power that had punctuated the first half of the album.

**jasannn** (7): Chill bop but the stagnant vocals and production is holding it back.

**skargardin** (7): This is a bit weirdly placed in the album coming from the interlude but its good

hvyjseq,t3_smfmf0,"My favorite story of this era is how after founding Shooto. Satoru Sayama saw the first UFC event and went ""Damn, I got do this myself"". He organized the Vale Tudo Open Japan tournament in 1994, he tried to get Royce Gracie but instead got something even better: his older brother Rickson, the so-called ""Champion"" of the Gracie family.

Royce won trhough the UFC with his jiu-jitsu grappling skills. Rickson didn't even need them, he could just throw you into the ground and ground-and-pound the fuck out of you, he smashed through the Vale Tudo Japan '94 and became a big figure in the combat sports circle in Japan.

Takada was trying to save UWFi and he saw in Rickson his own ""Muhammed Ali"", he tried to have a match with him, but it fell through because Takada wanted a work (like the rest of Inoki's fmaous style vs style matches, the Ali bout was an exception). One of Takada's friends, Yoki Anjo fell insulted by Rickson and did what was tradition and kept issuing public challenges and insults, but he took a step further when he took a group of Japanese journalists, took them to Los Angeles and challenged Rickson right there on the spot. Unexpected for him, Rickson agreed to the challenge and proceeded to give Anjo the beating of his life, Anjo refused to give up even after the mat turned into a pool of his own blood and the journalist left to Japan with a face of Anjo defeated and bloody. Which was yet another blow to the UWFi's reputation.

A few years later, UWFi finally closed down, but Takada was still super popular. He was pressured by some interested parties (i.e the Yakuza, which bankrolled Japanese Pro Wrestling) to fight Rickson in a shoot match in 1997, the undercard would be composed by the best MMA fighters of the time (well, the few ones that actually existed). The actual event saw a pretty ok undercard and the main event had Takada steamrolled and fans discovering his worked pro wrestling abilities didn't match up his real fighting skills, but it attracted almost 47,000 fans. In a sport that 4 years before barely even existed. And the rest was history.",LordLoko,,19,19,2022-02-07 16:12:20

hrfyw3q,t3_rx22z0,"I never understood exactly why klab decided to choose that the gameplay needed to be a mix between rythm and rpg.
I don't have a problem at all with the gameplay but it's look half finished because we are supposed to be the manager and that's why we ""made"" the group diverge between focusing on some character or others or at least that's what it says in the tutorial, but in the reality you don't really feel anything related to that because if you fail a note nothing change and yeah that would be a little hard but at least they could do something like ""ok you lost 1/5 of your stamina and one of the lights turn off and then when you lost another another light turn off until you lost and all the scenery turn off"" or something like that because when you are playing at least for me you don't really feel nothing at all you can do anything and the stage would be the same.

Well that was my opinion about the gameplay and sorry if I wrote something wrong my main language isn't english.",DDDD500,,35,35,2022-01-06 03:26:18
hrgkmo6,t3_rx22z0,"I've been playing global SIFAS since day 1, and was playing everyday since then. After SIFAS is getting more grindy, I decided to drop SIF and totally into SIFAS. The day they announced they going to sell off the game to MyNet, I stopped SIFAS. Like what OP said in part 1, the problem faced by SIFAS is spot on.

1 thing I would like to add on is, there is no affordable way in buying star gems. In other game like Genshin Impact, at least they introduce the monthly pass ( which is cheaper, but you receive gem bit by bit for 1 month ). At first I was excited and decided to buy the monthly pass when they announced it, but when I see the content and the price, it is a big no for me. I would rather they changed the package from free daily scout to receive a certain amount of star gems, as players need them to scout on the particular limited box.The most effective way to obtain star gem is, wait for promotion ( 10 > 50 star gem ) or buy the star gem package ( not sure is 3,300 or 3,500 star gem, which gives you X amount of gem per day ). But, that is just 70 draws consider that expensive price tag !

It is just too much RNG and cost to improve existing team, consider the huge idol lineup of the box, the chances of getting a good card ( not to mentioned to get the UP card ) is very slim. I remember I spent 220 pulls on Cosmic Driver Honoka Fes Box, after finished scouting, I realized I only get 1 Fes Card ( Honoka ) out of 13 or 14 UR card I get. I was so pissed. Not to mention the cards getting outdated very quickly.

I enjoy SIFAS story, especially seeing how Muse, Aqours and Nijigasaki  members interact with each other. Previously, I am Printemps fans, now I grew to like CYaRon and AZuNa due to  the story and exposure to their song.

I keep playing, was hoping the game will change to a better way. But right after I saw the announcement, and checked the background of MyNet, I just felt .. pain.  


I dunno ... I was playing SIF/SIFAS everyday for the past 5 years. Now after stopped both, I don't felt relieved, just felt kind of empty.

hrgkzpg,t3_rx22z0,"To be honest, this is probably the only game I've ever played that I REALLY didn't enjoy but I still played just because I love the franchise. God it's just really painful to go through all of the loading screens when the point of the game nowadays is to try different teams for different songs. And the events are also just the same for I don't know how long now. I won't pretend to know what kind of new events I'd want, but at least try different things? Even the UI for all events are also the same, look at how Arknights put the effort to make different UIs for each events.

I literally only play this game to see the MVs, but even then I don't even have any motivation left to continue the story to unlock new songs. Their great characters are one of their best points, but then season 2 happened

It's really sad to see this game declining because I really love Love Live and the MVs, but it's just really painful to play.

hrg7fnp,t3_rx22z0,"Klab's perspective on getting rid of SIFAS now is understandable, the argument you put forth is compelling and makes a lot of sense, and is backed up by KLab's past actions. I think a lot of what you said also applies to why KLab game station has been discontinued (RIP). Though, I wonder about the perspectives of the IP holders themselves (Bandai) and Bushiroad. The decision to move SIFAS development to Mynet had to involve the higher-ups, as, at the end of the day, they hold far more control over the love live IP than KLab, who got the rights to make a love live mobile game in 2013. 



I imagine Bandai is not happy with 2 franchises of theirs failing with KLab, and Bushiroad could be eager to get a bigger piece of the love live pie. And I don't think this timing is what KLab wanted either, as SIFAS had just launched in China in 2021, and the 2nd anime season of Nijigasaki was coming up, just in time for KLab to be cut out of possible cross promotion. As you pointed out, KLab invested a lot into SIFAS. For KLab to suddenly give up All Stars to another company, which I don't think you've mentioned them doing before, just seems odd right now.",Todetract,,22,22,2022-01-06 04:31:12
hrgl4vb,t3_rx22z0,"It’s like. Fundamentally, the sort of ppl that want to minmax and the sort of ppl that want to casually play are different, and SIFAS is unsatisfying for both. 

If you want to minmax, you have to open your wallet - there is no alternative (in Love Live!, you could minmax through paying, but also through slow card acquisition/skill slots/actually increasing your own skill) but you could also S-score most songs with a semi-decent team. 

With Allstars, if I want to use a team of just my faves I am inherently locked from playing half the main game songs - and I have to look into teambuilding, which I don’t want to!

SIFAS feels… unecessary… to say the least. What I want is SIF but with SIFAS art/3D and I’ll be a happy boi. More than anything though, I just want KLab to understand that in-game guides/explanations are IMPORTANT. SIFAS relies entirely on content creator guides and SIF global received that massive update to merge it with JP and all the new additions have almost nothing to explain anything. How is that conducive to any sort of growth????",theamazinghesh,,17,17,2022-01-06 11:01:56
hrfu5fy,t3_rx22z0,"TLDR: **Klab's got no one to blame but themselves for this, and if there is a new game eventually it would be in everyone's best interest to stick with what worked before instead of this weird hybrid thing.**

My hope is that if we do end up getting a new LL game if SIFAS doesn't pull through (which is a very realistic possibility) they pick either teambuilding or rhythm to focus on for gameplay. SiF worked because even people who didn't know what Love Live was understood the concept: tap the notes to the beat, and they did a damn good enough job at making it fun to play. Of course, teambuilding is there, but it's entirely optional if you're just concerned with the main gameplay. In high school people would watch me play it during lunch and be like ""Oh cool it's like Guitar Hero with anime girls!"" and I mean...yeah, basically! SIFAS was extremely hyped up prior to its release but we didn't know what gameplay even looked like until *4 days* before release. They told us it was some kind of rhythm action RPG but no one knew what they meant until it came out, that's not exactly great marketing. I vividly remember a few days before launch at the SIF 2019 Thanksgiving event the Nijigaku seiyuu were visibly confused as to what they were even doing during a gameplay demonstration. If they had made the RPG elements fun to play/easier to get behind without reading like 50 guides on how to get started and more F2P friendly (combined with a better writing team) I don't think we'd be having this conversation right now. There's not a lot of fun to be had playing SIFAS, and they haven't added anything new to remedy that besides School Idol Channels which in of themselves are a chore. They also don't really take advantage of the fact that they've got *all* of the original LL cast at their disposal to use for stories. There's so much uncovered ground they could cover with just that alone for the main story, and yet we ended up with Season 2.

Look, I don't have a problem with the overall concept of SIFAS. It's a gameplay style that's not for me, but it still has its fans and shows plenty of potential. It's just very alienating to casual fans and overall not a sound time investment. There's no natural progression of skill the way there is in SiF, just scout better cards and hope for the best. There are plenty of mobage out there that follow that business model, but it's not the entire bulk of those games play style and there are other things to do. Love Live could be on top of the mobile game world right now if Klab played their cards right, interest in the franchise overall hasn't subsided much considering both Nijigasaki and Superstar were some of the highest selling TV anime titles of 2021! Sure, it's not pulling in Uma Musume numbers (those BD's were packed with in game codes so that drove up sales a shit ton), but it is still a very viable and profitable IP within both Japan and overseas that's in the hands of the wrong people in the games department. The series still prints money, and it doesn't look like that will slow down anytime soon.

My theory is a new game that's somewhat similar to SIFAS/directly linked to it will be put into development soon since I can't imagine they'd want to put all the time and energy into something that goes to waste within its first 3 years but it most certainly will not be done by Klab. I initially thought the plan going forward for LL was to have the next gen rhythm focused game be WaiWai Home Meeting on Playstation consoles with montly new content like cards or songs but Square Enix pretends like it doesn't exist so that's out. Something's gotta give here, I couldn't fathom LL staff being okay an outdated relic that's been running for damn near 10 years (Christ I'm getting old)  be the brands flagship game offering so we'll just have to see. This is probably one of the reasons Liella hasn't been implemented fully, because that would be a bit of a high risk and low possible return situation. I have a hunch that a new game would probably just be SiF 2 with plenty of QoL improvements, SIFAS elements and 3D music videos, because if it ain't broke don't fix it. Going forward Nijigaku will be fine without SIFAS being their primary source of content, with Anijigasaki Season 2 coming out in 3 months time and the Nijigaku girls getting the same amount of attention and success its non-spin off generation counterparts get (not to mention the huge crowds they draw in during concerts) I don't think they'll need SIFAS to sustain themselves. I'm not keeping my hopes up at Mynet reversing any of the collateral damage Klab got themselves into, though it would be a pleasant surprise if they could. I want this game to make it despite its challenges, I really do! There's a lot of work to be done, so all we can do is pray.",DitzyHooves,,43,43,2022-01-06 02:48:24

For a few months now SIFAS felt more like a chore than a game, events weren't fun and I couldn't be bothered to minmax teams for Expert+ and Challenge songs since there's ALWAYS a loading screen.

Regarding Season 2, I always wanted more conflict and drama in the Love Live franchise, but it was SO badly written it felt like a joke in the end. I think players would be way more receptive if the plot had a good development, even if they still kept the ""breaking up the girls"" premise. 
Hell, in Revue Starlight we have the Arcana Arcadia main storyline where friendships (and ships) are being destroyed, Tamao has declared war on other schools, Nana is back to her ruthless ways and everyone LOVES it because it's well written.

Well, this whole situation just makes me really sad because I'm SO attached to Love Live and wanted to keep seeing the girls daily, but SIFAS was just not it in the end.

I hope Klab makes another Love Live rhythm game with 3-D aspects in the future, but meanwhile I'll stick with Revue Starlight and Project Sekai (and Entars maybe?).",anaefs,,13,13,2022-01-06 19:41:16

hrh4sq1,t3_rx22z0,">Yu Yu Hakusho: 100% Maji Battle is a 2D auto-battler that was released by KLab in August 2018. In this game, players collect cards and use their abilities to defeat waves of enemies. The [gameplay](https://youtu.be/D3a2-icR_qw) is very basic, and uses animated 2D sprites. The main feature of the game; though, is that it re-enacts scenes from the Yu Yu Hakusho anime series by showing stills from anime episodes. This attracts existing Yu Yu Hakusho fans who want to relive the story told in the anime as well as new fans who want to learn more about Yu Yu Hakusho.

And it's done pretty well! I'm a long-time YYH fan and I've played the game, it's quite enjoyable. Nothing over the top with the graphics and all (not boring though!), but it's a **friendly** game, unlike SIFAS — there are tons of campaigns, the rates are good and you can build a decent deck even if you're f2p, the team-building side isn't tedious at all from my experience, the modes are fun. Overall it reminds me a lot of Revue Starlight which makes me wonder how things would have been if SIFAS went on a battle route too, instead of rhythm. However, I'm aware the concept of LL wouldn't make much sense in that genre the way it does for the other two. Also, any attempt of putting characters against each other feels like taboo here (see: story blacklash). 

There's just a lack of enjoyment in the current gameplay, where really you only have to beat songs and hunt the best cards for that (or worse, where you can only pass a song if you have a *specific* card), and everything else is a skip ticket routine. It would be nice to have a mode too where players are against each other, I think SBL simply doesn't satisfy that all that well nowadays.

hrjgs9e,t3_rx22z0,"Another excellent article.  I guess I've always viewed it that Bushiroad forced them to make the change, and KLab probably didn't mind since they were bleeding money.  Definitely makes a lot of sense that if KLab also wanted to do it, and salvage whatever funds they get from selling the game.

&#x200B;

It's interesting that KLab never really went into the low-flying mode with SIFAS.  They set the ""norm"" since maybe end of year 1, when DLP was introduced, and they have kept it relatively the same level since.  Besides adding the channel system, they still kept up with introducing new cards (well, gacha is revenue), but still kept adding in new songs, stories, and events.  Yes, songs were slow, but they really could've cut a lot of corners if they wanted to.  For something that was spelling trouble since 2020, I guess they were actually doing more than just the minimum to try to make game back afloat.  Ultimately it just wasn't enough, just as your previous article has pointed out.

&#x200B;

The only thing really is that they stopped being generous with quartz, which I think is a big mistake.  Giving out free stuff might lower immediate revenue, but it's something that keeps users happy and to hook them in to spend in the future.  Thus we all know it was a huge mistake to give out almost nothing during 2nd anniversary.

I assume the reason for that has less to do with the actual quality of their songs and more with the fact that they offered some sort of special extra with each CD so that whales would spend all their money on buying as many CDs as possible.

I don't know if it was this group, but I remember reading about idol groups holding contests where fans could vote for their favourite idol, and you got one vote for each CD you bought, so obsessed fans would each buy hundreds of CDs to cast hundreds of votes for their favourite.",ChuckCarmichael,,14,14,2024-03-15 07:28:42

2. Sayuri - The arrangement was challenging, and while there were errors, she played through them well.
3. Sakiko - By far the weakest of the arrangements. It was performed well, but compared to the other two pieces, it just doesn't require the same level of skill to perform.

Imagine my disappointment when JYJ were constantly getting themselves into scandals; and listening to people trash talk them while the other two boys stayed on their best behaviour.

I used to hope that by now, someone has released a tell-all. I also use think that at least by now, they would have already acknowledged each other publicly. Living in 2020 (or recent years) as a dbsk fan is like grasping at every opportunity to validate their memories.

ge5mstb,t3_hrgzss,"Coming late to the party, but it made me so nostalgic—and bitter. I came into KPop in 2010, exactly ZE year of the drama (I thought JYJ signed with Avex? I know that DB5K was under Avex for their Japanese songs), but 2010 was also the year where hits from mid 2000s were still big hits, so Wrong Number and Mirotic were quite the jam (I remember going to a Korean restaurant in my city, the TV played KPop MVs, Wrong Number played, my group of friends and the people at the neighbouring cheered, it was around 2011-2012 or so). 

I never was a hater of 2VXQ or JYJ, Before U Go and In Heaven hold dear places in my heart. Changmin got married, Junsu just released a new album, and I'm binging on Jaejoong's rock songs (I like the J-Rock influence a lot). 

I like that you put the emphasis on how big they were, it's something people nowadays forget. Yes BTS is big, but in the era of Windows XP and crappy youtube video quality, DB5K's international success was quite impressive, them, SuJu, SHINee and BigBang paved the way for Exo and BTS. Didn't DB5K figure once or twice in the Business Records?

But yes, I had a friend who was such a huge fan of DB5K, she got me and two others in the boysband. I recently was listening to some best of, and wow, the feels. There's hardly any band like them (with their fame) nowadays, the KPop labels focus a lot more on impressive choregraphies than vocal versatility (DB5K can dance. It's something I miss of 2nd gen KPop, it's the storytelling feel through dance). 

About the attitude of the fandom, for the part that is open-minded, I think it comes with the average age of the Cassies? I consider myself pretty young (I'm 23), said friend, I'm not in touch with her anymore, but I guess she graduated from Masters, or has started a career. Many Cassies are done with school, have a job, may have a family, so I think that when you're 25-35, you don't go to war the same way a 15yo would. But then, even Cassies aren't imune to division (i.e, 2010), but that was 10 years ago. People are probably less utopist when it comes to ignoring the shit their idols did. Seeing DB5K reunited again will probably never happen (or maybe in a decade or two, who knows, but I doubt it, their lives and careers will have evolved by the time they're 40-50). It's sad, but it's how it is.

TL;DR: I'm rambling because I like to talk about DB5K lol",,,2,2,2020-11-30 15:41:53
ggmq2hx,t3_hrgzss," I’m replying to this after 5 months but I just want to say this is one of the best impartial/unbiased recap of want went to down on the 2VXQ / JYJ split.

Also interesting for me how my feelings and perception about the them have changed over these past 10yrs.

Way back 2009 I was really heartbroken about the whole drama. Admittedly, I had then sided with JYJ mainly because Jaejoong was my favourite on the group and I find the trio funny compared to HoMin which I feel was an awkward pairing. I had developed a resentment with SM also at that time related to Hangeng’s case(SuJu).

I have supported both JYJ and 2VXQ but leaning more towards JYJ. Honestly I was then irritated with HoMin for not leaving SM. I thought Yunho and Changmin were being cowards. I also found it ironic how the two members with the least chemistry ended up being the duo.

Fast forward 10 yrs with all the scandal and seeing how the boys behaved, watching most of their appearances/shows, I have come to appreciate HoMin more (specially Yunho).

TVXQ have stayed humble while they continued persevering.

JYJ on the other hand, I don’t know if it’s because they do not appear on TV shows seems to have lost connection to their fans.

I still love them equally but this is just my general feelings.

I felt like JYJ became more like western celebrities with all the scandals, their fancy penthouses, sports car etc. Nothing wrong with how they decide to live their lives of course. But LOL to such difference in comparison to how YunHo lives (see I Live Alone episode).  
 I just really appreciated how HoMin stayed grounded, YunHo has been an icon of passion and well respected in the industry. I’ve closely followed their variety shows as well and admired the way they worked hard despite all the shenanigans that happened. It’s still true that YunHo and Changmin are the least compatible in DB5K, but they’re teamwork and perseverance as a duo was amazing. And you can clearly see how Changmin admires YunHo and how Yunho tries his very best to uphold TVXQ’s legacy. I have nothing but respect for 2VXQ now and come to realise it is not cowardice that made them stay in SM but because it is what they actually believe was right and stood by it. Although of course we will probably never know the complete truth on the contract issues.

With the Yoochun scandal there is probably no chance for reunion anymore. 10 yrs is a long period and there is no reason for 2VXQ to taint the squeaky clean image they worked so hard for.

I think most fans have moved on now. It’s just that sometimes you cannot help but wonder how much higher they could have soared if they stayed together.",dinseon,,2,2,2020-12-21 22:24:11

g6wljr6,t3_hrgzss,"I can't believe it's been a decade. It's crazy and sad. I got into them in 2011, right after they broke up lmao, and just devoured everything, right down to the hilarious weird dramas they made about fictionalized versions of themselves.

I became a JYJ fan, and though I loved Changmin (his vocal range is insane) it was too painful for me to ever listen to the new DBSK/TVXQ because SM wanted to pretend like nothing was wrong and that they were really the Rising Gods of the East, just those two, this whole time. That's how it's always felt.

What brought me here honestly was a return to tumblr, and seeing all these blogs as you mentioned with the nasty ""YUNHO & CHANGMIN ONLYYYYYY"" and I felt so shocked and hurt. Back when I was caught up in the aftermath of the lawsuit, I think all I really took in was a lot of hurt and depressed fans still trying to figure out what was gonna happen next. No one was taking sides yet, not to that extent, and we were mostly hopeful that things would work out in the end.

I think they all deserve equal recognition. Not saying you have to like Jae and Junsu if you're a fan of TVXQ/DBSK nowadays, but I think credit where credit is due. They all made it together, y'know? I get if you don't like them but the vitriol is unnecessary.

Sigh. I think the hardest hits for me have been all the things going on with Micky Yoochun. He was my favorite and now, if my understanding of K-Pop culture is correct, because of his scandal and retirement in disgrace, a full comeback of DB5K is impossible because he can never perform again. (which I really really hate because despite everything I still love his singing and his rapping with U-Know) Learning what kind of a person he really was was so shocking and just...painful. Ugh.

&#x200B;

*Personally*, I think JYJ has poorer management (had?) and that's why so many scandals got out. SM keeps a tighter leash on their stars, so anything that may have happened with DB2K maybe got hushed up by the mega corporation in order to maintain the band. Again, it's a theory and it's not meant to throw shade, just to speculate why it seems only one half of the group is acting out and the others haven't so much as jaywalked. So perhaps the freedom JYJ fought for is the same freedom that has basically dissolved them, sadly.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Should mention I got into them as Koda Kumi fan, having found them through the song ""LAST ANGEL"". She seems to have been on terms with Changmin and Yunho within the past few years, as she posted some picture with the two to her Insta, but it sucks that due to the record labels' control, I'll probably never know if she ever hits up Jae or Junsu too.",,,1,1,2020-09-28 00:26:31
gg063uv,t3_hrgzss,"Amazing post. Takes me back when I was in high school! 

As a cassie, DBSK was the first boy band I ever stanned and was the first group that got me into jpop (purple line) and then kpop (Rising sun). It was heart wrenching when they split esp when they were at the height of their popularity. It saddens me that there's a whole generation of kpop fans who don't even know how amazing they are! I remember the epic fan wars between Big Bang and DBSK...good times haha.

I've always been OT5 and supported all of them after the split. But ever since Yoochun's scandals over the years, it really soured my love for JYJ and in the larger sense my interest in DB5K.  I used to dream of a OT5 reunion which at this point is impossible...

gh3p5rk,t3_hrgzss,"Well summarized! 

I'm a newer fan too (started in 2020) and its bizarre to see just how divided the fandom is but it also makes perfect sense with all that this group and their members have been through. I came to know tvxq as the duo and love them for it, but couldn't help but look into the ex members and have eventually come to like and support jaejoong and junsu as well. They are amazingly talented and within a span of a month during quarantine i was into it- and i can tell I'll be for a long, long time. I did look into the lawsuit and i find both sides perfectly reasonable- choices were made and all we can do is support them for it! 

Yoochun tho is a totally different story, one i refuse to associate myself in any way to because my love for kpop will never be above my morals and let's just say he didn't just get in trouble (proven or otherwise), he also did a piss poor job handling it publicly (words and actions yc words and actions) and has managed to lose my respect completely.

 I don't expect a reunion, nor do i think it will be happening or if it even should be happening so i go by the 2vxq name, because that's what they are now - 2! I enjoy both pre and post split music and also support their solo careers (jaejoong and junsu too) but what blows my mind is this makes ME an outlier in the fandom- ot2 but don't HATE jyj...not ot5 but chill with 2/3 of the ex members...in conclusion, reply to this post if you agree with my stance and maybe my stan Twitter experience won't be so lonely anymore (tho i have come to find some likeminded individuals!)",be_ts,,1,1,2020-12-26 20:49:23

I actually loved Mirotic and Keep Your Head down, got introduced to them by a friend and they're still in my playlist to this day.

Always wondered what happened to them; I did a Wiki search some years ago and learned about the lawsuit. I guess it's just my western perspective here but the idea of a 13 year contract for a \*boy band\* leaves me going ""what?"" and assumes that that's to take advantage of any commercials, tv show spots, and whatnot along with their band performances.

Suddenly what happened to the lead singer of SHINEE makes a lot of sense in terms of work stress, if a company can lock you down like that.

lhh9wgg,t3_1ep0tqz,"Incredible director any way you spin it. 

On a somewhat related note. I do wish Japanese studios would just report WW data for their movies. Because trying to make sense of how much some anime movies did WW is just a pain in the ass. For instance. The Boy and The Heron absolutely did make $100M+ in China and  the number is somewhere around $108-109M. But this is not reflected on BOM while The Numbers has it but then it has the movie under $300M while as you say some places claim it made $300M+

Castle In The Sky is another easy example. It made $18M+ in China alone last year for its Childrens Day re-release. Then it made at least another $5-6M in Europe across some re-relases back in the 2000's. That alone is way more than either the $15.5M and $18.7M figure that are floating around.

Miyazaki, Takahata, Yonebayashi, all made outstanding works, though my favourite is probably The Wind Rises.

Then I got to finally see a Ghibli movie on the big screen when The Boy and the Heron released here in North America, and it was a nice departure from the usual blockbusters I see in theatres.

Obviously, you have to protect towns and also, people have spread out into areas where there used to be no one, but in some places, letting a fire run its course might have been the best thing to do to get rid of all the dead vegetation. Combine that with historic droughts and you have a huge problem. My husband is a former (urban) firefighter and we've talked about this a lot. So maybe we're reaching some sort of tipping point where we're seeing these crazy fires and eventually they will decrease. I do know that I have lived throughout the west, both Canada and the USA for over 50 years and have never seen anything like this, and it feels insane.",,,1,1,2020-09-11 17:11:22

g4utwdo,t3_iqd5sk,"I know you know all this and probably won't even read this comment... but it helps sometimes to remember where we stand. [Stories like this](https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/ancient-stories-could-be-more-fact-than-fiction) I've always found fascinating. Oral tradition of the aboriginal people surviving through the end of the last ice age. The Klamath people around here, telling each generation of the birth of crater lake in a battle of the Gods, an even passed down for around 7,600 years.
History has inflection points. Not everyone makes it through each one, so it's rough having to live through it, but many of our ancestors have been through the same. There was a time when the only people living here were first nations people. It ended badly for them, but there have been at least some improvements in rights over the last 50 years. There have been plagues my ancestors in Europe lived through. Wars, we've all had ancestors that have had to put up with cultural changes brought on by technology... feudalism to monarchies, monarchies to industrial countries, industrial countries to information age countries. We're in the opening stages of the next great change it seems like, thanks to social media and modern recommender systems (at least in part).

I don't know what comes next, but I know what needs to be done now. Know the people you support, that you can lean on in turn. Know how to keep yourself sane and stable with everything that's going on. Know how to engage in the ways you can afford to help tip the balance towards a better future, while still accepting that things may not go well regardless of what you do. Finding that fine line between martyrdom and helplessness is hard, especially in an environment of media carefully engineered to create disconnected consumers, but... that's our times. This is our legend to pass down, for better or worse. It's not time yet to give up hope for a good future, even if that good future is no longer a foregone conclusion like we were raised to believe. What's left after that, is learning to live sustainably in a stressful present.

It really is bonkers though, especially with conservative relatives living out of state that have been taught to believe untrue things about our day to day lives. How bizarre.",adventuringraw,,1,1,2020-09-11 19:38:02

Even with the truth of the adversity facing us, each thing has a functional path to resolution:

Have more conversations with your parents about the coming election than social media is having with them. 

I recently listened to an inspiring take on tackling climate change, where the gist was to more heartily embrace systemic change via focusing on candidates that will address it, because like many large scale issues it is almost crushingly maddening to feel like taking them on as an individual. 

While direct action matters, being realistic about the virtue of voting for change being the means to enact plans aimed at our larger issues frees each of us to breathe just a little bit easier. 

Millions of us know one or more people that are the victims of disinformation and deliberate efforts aimed at disenfranchising minorities, women, and others who are marginalized, while seeking to divide the white and male voting bloc based on the false virtues of toxic masculinity. 

When the above all come crashing down on me, I unplug for a bit and turn to a book because there’s zero engagement algorithms, zero pop ups, and nothing to hijack my attention span. 

It also turns out that it gives me something interesting and non polarizing to focus on when talking with my parents, which greatly reduces the stress I sometimes feel when trying to patiently navigate and diffuse all the biased talking points they are bombarded with-simply because they don’t know how to turn off those suggestions in their feed. 

Please-

I can’t stress enough-

Talk to your parents more about this election than social media is talking to them about it.",,,-1,-1,2020-09-10 22:02:13

The shear force they bring to these protests are an inappropriate use of resources, a protest of 100 people should not spread a police force so thin folks cannot count on the police at all. Everywhere in the US is experiencing a very predictable crime wave due to the pandemic, remember what I said about the sudden unemployment here? However, in Portland, most residents have the view that we are on our own right now, we view this as a purposeful strike by the police to punish the citizens of this city. But it's not just the local law enforcement that has abandoned us

That's quite the narrative you have there. That word ""overwhelmingly"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting. JFK's ride through Dealey Plaza was also overwhelmingly peaceful; it's remarkable anyone even mentions the violence.

And as far as the police abandoning people, isn't that exactly what the protesters are asking the police to do? They want less policing, right?

Beautifully curated i must say, you made sure to capture a lot of aspects of his journey and his progression to finally putting out his work to the world. from the long hair, the tattoos and the ""edgy rocker"" image to being the wildest and loudest nct performer and of course the butterfly link concert version, all of it has been a stepping stone to the things he's managed to do now. i'm sure that people who don't know yuta or aren't nct fans would appreciate the context. He literally had to claw out his way through all of it. I heavily agree about the absurdity of the promo (or the lack thereof) i think it leaves a sour taste in the mouths of all yuta fans. His solo career is attributed to him and only him. So glad that he got to represent himself in the best way possible through his album and execute the concert on his own terms. he does have everything he needs to be able the artist he had always wanted to be.

fc8fxjx,t3_egg7b8,"This is a weird WK for me as I got very used to Being the Elite kind of being my portal into the world of NJPW, and before that I watched NJPW only sporadically, because although the wrestling is great, there is undeniably a barrier of entry for a general western customer to their product, in the sense that they don't have western poster boys helping to market the product overseas like they did while having Kenny, or the audience like myself that followed AJ from TNA. 

That being said, the cards look good and very interesting and I will be watching the shows. Hoping to see some great matches. I'm a big fan of a few of the NJPW guys like Switchblade and Ospreay.

hkzd8ww,t3_kideua,"Touko Kirishima is certainly a mysterious character.

Perhaps she is a Mai; an alternate Mai tied to the young Mai that keeps randomly popping up. After all there was a comment about her similarity in appearance to Mai in a previous volume if I recall.

Unsure as to how it would work but perhaps Touko is Mai if Sakuta failed to ""bring her back"" After, internet celebrity; under an alias may actually work as a backdoor way of ""fixing"" her non-existence. Though ""Mai"" is gone this new persona exists but has a mysterious background due to her original self no longer existing in the public psyche.

Another theory would be that Touko Kirishima is Mai's mother's long standing puberty syndrome. Effectively akin to Futaba's personal civil war; perhaps she too split over her personal desire to become famous. After all, the two main reasons for parents to aggressively enforce child stardom on their kids is for either money or fame in which the latter involves vicariously living through their child. 

My last guess would be Touko Kirishima is somehow Sakuta and Mai's daughter who due to her jealously of her mother desired to compete with her on a more level stage per say.",thewookie5,,1,1,2021-11-17 12:54:45

Also, I feel for Japan, as they're trying to get their population quickly vaccinated with remarkable results so far. But that recent news article stating that basically the ruling government parties don't even know why they should consider easing entry restrictions on foreigners based on vaccination is worrisome.

h8ni35c,t3_ovw3kh,"Interesting data point: a good friend of mine needed to travel from Hong Kong to Japan for family reasons. He's a US citizen. After a lot of head-scratching, the Japanese consulate informed him that he didn't need a visa to travel to Japan! The reason is clear when you go through all the fine print on the entry restrictions: for some reason Japan never suspended the visa waiver program for US citizens, so a US citizen who hasn't been in a banned country within the past 14 days can still enter Japan without a visa as a temporary visitor. He was told to bring all of the documents needed for a visa with him just in case, but immigration at Haneda never looked at them. He had to quarantine in a hotel for two weeks but was free to move around after that.

This is probably only useful for American expats living in the unbanned Asia/Pacific countries (since staying in most countries outside the region within the past 14 days will render you ineligible to enter Japan and the unbanned countries generally don't allow visitors in), and you should definitely check with your local Japanese diplomatic post before attempting this. It may also work for Canadians as I don't see that their visa waiver is formally suspended either. It doesn't work for locals from Hong Kong, Singapore, China, Korea, Australia, etc., as their visa issuance or visa waivers have all been suspended despite their countries being taken off the banned list.",sutsusame,,11,11,2021-08-12 13:31:37

The answer was going to be whether or not he won the title there. So watching him win made me the happiest 10 yr old in the world that night. Was just jumping and running around everywhere in the house.  Unforgettable night.

I agree 100% with Vince's decision. Not only was it a great feel good moment, the win expanded the feud of HBK and HHH, which was the biggest and most prominent story on Raw. So it made the most sense for Shawn to win and get his revenge from Summerslam. Also, Wrestlemania 19 was 4 months away. Why waste putting over a new star before that point? Wrestlemania should've been the goal for that purpose, but unfortunately we know how that went for Booker T....

Warning: The above data should only be taken as a rough guide of progress of the spread of (and fight against ) the disease only. Reasons:-

1 - shortages of ready-to-use testing kits (and/or ingredients to make the kits) in some countries continue

2 - differences between countries as to testing approaches (who should be tested, when and why)

3 - speed to get test results back vary between countries

4 - People with minor symptoms are unlikely to be tested in multiple countries

5 - Country / individual doctor variances in attributing deaths to Covid-19 (multiple media reports around the world have been flagging up that many of the victims that have died had other underlying medical issues)

 Managing Grief During a Pandemic

by Doreen Marshall, Ph.D.  
Vice President of Mission Engagement, AFSP  
Many of us are grieving right now. We are grieving people we have lost, in many instances not having had the opportunity to say goodbye or to be with them in their final moments. We are grieving not being able to have our in-person presence to support one another right now. We are grieving our rituals, our routines and the familiarity of our day-to-day assumptions. For those of us who have a history with grief (especially the unexpected kind), we may be having grief of those former losses stirred and awakened. This week alone, I had two separate dreams connected to previous losses (a death and a miscarriage). I had to remind myself when I woke that it was not those events reoccurring, but another, entirely distinct set of losses that I was currently experiencing.  


Grief can be messy. It’s not linear, as in, “when I get through this particular feeling, I’m done with that.”  It is cyclical and lingers around important events, words not said, certain songs, and moments captured like photographs in our minds. It is a place we can choose to visit or ignore, though it resides in the background as if waiting for us to notice.  


If you are experiencing grief right now, here are some things you might remind yourself:

1. **There are different ways to say goodbye.** Unexpected endings tend to bring strong emotions, often anchored in both the present and the past, when we may have felt abandoned or left behind. There are different ways to say goodbye. Write a letter to your loved one, even if you end up being the only one who sees it. If your loved one has died or is in a place you can’t visit, hold an intention for them in your mind, and say it aloud as you think of them throughout the day. One of my favorites is, “May you feel my love for you and be surrounded by peace.” 
2. **“The last sentence of the book doesn’t rewrite the entire story.”** Years ago, following the loss of someone dear to me, a wise person shared these words with me. It reminded me that even though I was unable to be with my loved one when he died, I had a book full of lines to draw upon that were the story of our life together and of our relationship. Many of those lines were expressions of our love, moments we shared together, conversations and memories. Remembering these feelings and these moments is how we get a sense of who the individual was; who we were with them; and what the relationship was—all of which surpasses their final moments. Right now is a good time to reflect on those earlier, better memories as best as you can, to remind yourself of the full picture of their lives and your connection.
3. **Connections can deepen over time, even after loss.** My father died 14 years ago this week. In the early days and weeks following his death, all I could remember was the image of him sick, and the trauma I associated with that. As time passed, my memories of him unexpectedly became richer and more accessible than they were in those early days. The images of him being sick began to fade away. I can now more easily remember his laugh and his jokes, and recognize the similarity between my daughter’s eyes and his. I also feel more connected to how he must have felt as a parent, now that I am one, myself. These are newer, deeper connections to my father, ones I couldn’t have anticipated at the time he died.
4. **You are not alone in your grief.** Know that others are also experiencing grief right now, and that there is support available. Online grief support, and grief support provided by mental health professionals, hospice centers and faith groups are all accessible to you, many via telehealth and other virtual platforms. You can learn about options for grief support by connecting to your local mental health providers, faith organizations or hospice, or through one of the following national resources: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1800 273-TALK (8255); Crisis Text Line: text TALK to 741741. If you are struggling with the loss of a loved one to suicide, even one that occurred prior to COVID-19, AFSP has our [Healing Conversations program](https://afsp.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=db11a6f2940a2b3d1fa0b2fe7&id=ae52ab6d35&e=fd391fc747), which provides peer-to-peer phone or video contact and resources for those struggling with suicide loss.

Please know, at this time, that others who have traveled the roads of grief are here for you and can serve as guides. Look to them for hope, healing and comfort during this difficult time, and know that days are ahead of you in which the intensity of your grief will be lessened, and replaced by loving memories.",Pontiacsentinel,,12,12,2020-04-20 17:46:06

I'm not a professional and purely anecdotal but meditation has helped me tremendously with my OCD/anxiety and addictive drug habit. I was through the roof with it all but thanks to meditation, its done wonders. I would recommend a ""retreat"" called Vipassana (they have centres all around the world but I am sure they are closed due to COVID. Highly recommend you/her having a read into it and see if it floats your boat - its no walk in the park though, lets put it that way but highly rewarding).

That being said, I have heard friends who tried the ""Head Space"" app on their phone to be helpful. I haven't tried it but worth a crack?

Since you're in the UK, here's the link for the UK Vipassana Centre.

ihyq4ha,t3_wa2ece,"This is a great write up and I hope others take the time to read it; thank you for posting.

I’m not too sure how to measure their legacy, it’s not a strong suit of mine, but I can’t imagine I’m anywhere near alone in feeling deeply inspired by their story. They were true blue collar guys treating punk rock as a blue collar job — I admired that they would book early and cheap shows to allow the working class people of san pedro easy opportunities to see them play — and there’s something about that no-frills attitude to art that I find deeply compelling. 

plus, “It’s Expected I’m Gone” is a top tier “how the hell is a song this skeletal so captivating” track

last thing I’ll add because I think this great post deserves a thorough reply: I had the pleasure of performing as a support act for Mike Watt a number of years ago at a stevedore bar in Pedro. We assumed we’d open for him, but it was a weeknight and his bandmates didn’t want to be out past 11 so we ended up playing last. the crowd of local longshoremen ignored us, but mike sat politely in a booth by the stage, watched us play and cheered for each song.",footnote304,,28,28,2022-07-28 07:53:09

ihzys5q,t3_wa2ece,"Great writeup.  Brilliant.

The Minutemen are criminally underrated in the alt and punk circles.  They never seem to get mentioned in the same breath as their Black Flag and Circle Jerk peers.  Even in the 80s, I can't say I met anyone who said ""The Minutemen are my favorite band.""  But everyone I knew liked them.

Nobody sounded like them at the time, and no one really sounded like them since.  You can hear their influence in later bands like Jesus Lizard, NoMeansNo and Beat Happening.

Mike Watt really should be up there with the 80s punk personalities like Rollins, Morris or even Flea.  His resume is insane.  I'm sure he could have had it, but I doubt the guy wanted it.

As much as like The Minutemen, I do like fIREHOSE a bit better.  Just personal taste.  fIREHOSE, while just as unique in sound, just seems to have a bit better musical focus.  Plus, the story of this guy from Ohio (or should I say 'fROMoHIO') driving across country on a whim to beg Watt and Hurley to keep playing is just a great story.

I worry that as time passes and my generation (X) in particular passes, The Minutemen may end up a footnote in musical history.   That's sad to me.",Alex_Plode,,11,11,2022-07-28 15:07:10
ii2jjug,t3_wa2ece,"Terrific write-up; as a former Angeleno who was a teenager during the heyday of SST, I knew most of this already (mostly from Azerrad’s book) but it’s great to see their history assembled so systematically.   What a great time in music, with bands like the Minutemen, The Meat Puppets, Husker Du, and Black Flag shattering the constraints surrounding punk, and hardcore in particular. I feel very fortunate to have been able to grow up in that era and see those bands live, though unfortunately I arrived in LA in ‘85 just a few months after D. Boon’s tragic death so I never got to see them live.  However, I was lucky enough to see fIREHOSE a couple of times and they were always incendiary live. 

You did an excellent job conveying how wildly eclectic the Minutemen were.  Their albums were literally bursting with ideas and spanned a dizzying array of genres, styles, and eras.  They were arguably the most ambitious and creative band of a very ambitious and creative scene. I always considered Double Nickels to be America’s answer to Sandinista, so stunningly eclectic in its inspirations. Neither is necessarily an easy listen—neither album ever allows you to get comfortable for any length of time before drastically changing genres or styles—but both ended up pushing punk beyond short, fast, sloppy, and angry songs without compromising the rebellious spirit of punk overall.

The best part of the Minutemen was how intelligent they were.  Yes, they were just three working-class kids from one of Southern California’s most working-class cities, and I don’t think any of them acquired much college education (though I could be wrong), but they educated themselves about an impressive number of topics.  In interviews, Boon and Watt would sometimes get into huge, convoluted arguments about everything from history to politics to economics.  

I hope younger generations of music fans continue to discover the Minutemen and their amazing legacy.",Aegis-Heptapod-9732,,2,2,2022-07-29 01:33:48

They've been wildly influential, to the point that now, bands are influenced by them 2nd of 3rd hand & may not even have ever listened to The Minutemen themselves...but the bands they listen to were influenced by The Minutemen, or maybe another generation back. Streaming & online availability has helped a lot more young people be able to discover this great music. a whole lot easier than mail ordering across the country(if you could even keep up with each little label that was releasing the good stuff back then). I really hope a few people who are unfamiliar with The Minutemen happen to see this post & actually read it...it's just the kind of thing to make a curious young(or not so young) music lover hunt down the music itself to listen to.

I know you're not a journalist but i think to gain a larger perspective it would've been even more elucidating if you talked about the punk zine scene and it's influence, since these records weren't even heard on college radio back then. And you can't talk about old-school punk/hardcore without focusing on their shows. Live DIY performances were even more important than records for these bands.",wip30ut,,1,1,2022-07-28 18:15:04

goh5mff,t3_lnqfzh,"My wife (39) has always had an interest in wrestling, having seen WWF/WCW growing up with her brothers, then watching it with me when we got together in 2000, along with ECW.

We both fell out with WWE in 2001 when things started going downhill without competition. We would go to the occasional house show if it came to our area, but we weren't watching otherwise. I'd heard about all these good things going on in ROH and NJPW, but didn't know where to start with them.

When AEW's first Double or Nothing event happened, we were hooked immediately. We became instant fans of a ton of people we'd never heard of, and as such, starting hearing about all the great things over the past decade or so that we'd been missing out on.

Our first NJPW event was when we watched Wrestle Kingdom 14 together. She really enjoyed it and certain people stood out to her, but she didn't really know anyone and couldn't get invested. For me, I was just seeing a lot of these guys for the first time as well, only knowing a handful, but knew I wanted to see more.

We watched the entire 19 shows of G1 Climax 30 and became super-fans. We haven't missed an event since.

I'm still not over with that...😠😠; and I still feel I have to apologize once again to the girls) ; plus, italians are often expected to be really emotional in response but it's not always the case, we can get very serious if the situation is perceived as really unique; and there's the common problem of a whole generation of younger ones that is not accustomed anymore to live shows participation...

fwqkc6m,t3_hjzniv,">The wrestling war is, for all intents and purposes, over.

Pretty much. The only three national brands of note in 1988 are the WWF, the NWA (Jim Crockett Productions), and the AWA. The AWA is slowly dying and would only draw 1,672 at their PPV later this year in Chicago. The NWA would be sold to Ted Turner later this year after financial problems by Crockett.

There are a few of the territories hanging on such as Vancouver, Portland, Stampede, World Class, Continental (Alabama), and the NWF. However, those would all close within a few years. The rest of the major territories have either been closed or sold to companies like the WWF and Jim Crockett Productions by this time.",James1DPP,,4,4,2020-07-02 20:49:55
fwq9wuy,t3_hjzniv,"The timing here works out for the theories about Crockett having sudden financial tribute. If I'm remembering my timeline correctly, Cornette and the Midnight signed their $225,000 guarantees a week before both the Freebirds and Tully and Arn were supposed to sign their new contracts. Tully and Arn were supposed to be on $350,000, I think. 

Anyway, Crockett had the meeting with his accountant where he discovered he was $2 million in debt - he was supposed to be $4 million in the black according to previous estimates - some time over the course of that week, so suddenly he stopped signing contracts and firing people for minor issues. 

The Midnight, Sting, Luger, and JJ Dillon ended up being the only people who managed to sign during this brief period in late 87 to early 88 where Crockett was signing big money deals. Flair was already on $750,000 a year, but he was a glaring exception to the average, and the Road Warriors were able to strong arm Crockett into $500,000 a year for all three of them by threatening to jump to the WWF, but most people dropped to $120,000 or less after this. Dusty made even more than Flair, but most of that was for being the booker, and he wouldn't last long after TBS took over.",,,3,3,2020-07-02 19:26:09

ivmlqnu,t3_ypx1vp,"Too tired to leave intelligent long winded explanation or feed back right now.

But I can leave a suggestion google, ""Social Fascism"" there some interesting hits and history on the subject.

Mainly this happens around when it's matter of protect the power involving a dictatorship and history of rationalizing it.

But one area it doesn't cover comes from experience.

 This can come in very personal forms in social, support offline or online groups too and its also why I don't interact with very many people in my life any more, especially online due to literally encountering lifetime of it.

There is my experiences, opinions, ideas and struggles that have shaped who I am, how I experience myself and how I belong or don't belong, what I say or don't say.

Then there is group ideologies of what groups think, do and how they enforce or interact with whomever is on the outside or possible threat and then whom they value.

This can exist in numerous types of groups be it alternative lifestyles communities, religious and political groups including peer or even PTA groups.

Sometimes it's this nonsensical, crazy I don't comprehensive concept of  protecting a Dictatorship and protecting and only valuing the Dictator, or whatever or whomever is most important to protect, nothing else matters, only the Dictator or the important thing that matters.

It can evolve into ugly scenarios around protecting people with the whole ""missing stair"" thing going or simply just there to alienate and create hostile situations with people stuck in la-la universes claiming they doing the opposite i.e. all about creating positive, healthy, safe communities that meet specific goals or certain activities.

But reality is  it becomes something else.

SGI/SG is one of those type of groups too. It's high maintenance, has tons of expectations on it's members, mixed with authoritarian and annoying crap that goes with it.

But there are other groups that can be just as unpleasant too.",,,2,2,2022-11-09 01:37:59

fh1eknn,t3_f0zrlt,"That was fantastic, just as good as the naito one

Your write ups are one of the few things that keep me constantly coming back to this sub, definitively saved

Its crazy to think Kenta's run in WWE is one of the few times a big name flopped in wwe, and it wasnt wwe's fault, but just some horribly timed injuries, kinda reminds of RVD, if we substitute injuries with pot

I think what Kenta realized is that more than respect, he just craved attention, he craved the spotlight, which at the end of the day is what all wrestlers want, the reason why having a world titles is important, is because, supposedly, if you have the world title, all eyes are on you, you are the biggest deal, and having the title means nothing if the spotlight still isnt actually on you (see Jericho as Undisputed Champ and CM Punk's reing being in the middle of Twice in a Lifetime)

I think what makes tomorrow's event so hype is pure context, this should be the fillerest defense ever, it's naito's first title defense, now way he drops the titles to kenta, but this is new beginning, the same event that bore witness to the rainmaker shock, and just that in itself changes everything, what if they do it again? 
We are all 99% sure Naito's retaining, but us naito fans are so used to suffering that that 1% has us terrified, that 1% is enough to have all of us on edge, if someone else is gonna go defensless on a title reing, its Naito

iizm2tr,t3_wggk65,"He may have come up empty on the last one, but this time he more than meets his mark, tossing Punk back inside the ring and heading to the top turnbuckle, where a MISSILE DROPKICK to the back of the head awaits the champion, CM stumbled, a DR. WILY BOMB completing the sequence! 1… 2… NOOOOO! Now Omega, finally delivering his first cover of the match, is the one left blue-balled, no release on the attempt. Channelling his emotions, he delivers a spray of boots to the inside of Punk’s knee, before cracking CM’s back over his knee with a hair-pull Backbreaker, reinvigorating the damage from earlier with the spill on the apron! Punk stumbling to his base, Omega sweeps out the legs to face-plant him, before grabbing the arms, dazing Punk with for a SNAP DRAGON SUPLEX, the Second City Saint seemingly out on his knees! Kenny kisses the finger gun and fires it in Punk’s direction, charging for the V-TRIGGER, but CM drops down at the last second to avoid it, before grabbing the Hammerlock, finally spiking Kenny with the DEVIL-LOCK DDT! Both men lay flat on the mat, chests heaving as they try to regain their breaths, Punk slowly starting to roll back to his base first, sights set on the top rope. Making the arduous climb, he points to the heavens, Macho Man style, before delivering a DIVING ELBOW DROP TO THE HEART! Picking Omega up, he ducks down, wanting to ease Kenny onto his shoulders, though a Big Boot simply blasts his face off in response!

Punk clutches the bridge of his nose, his eyes welling up from the shot, Omega proceeding to blast Punk with a hard fist to the skull! CM throws one in response, and they’re back to the fisticuffs, neither man willing to give in after fighting for oh so long. As the match gets deeper and deeper, Punk starts to peel back the curtains more on his caged animal style, losing his composure, just beating the hell out of Omega with right after right after right, before letting out a battle cry! Stepping back a few paces, he comes charging in for a YAKUZA KICK, but Kenny sees it coming, blasting him with another Big Boot, before SUDDENLY SPIKING WITH HIM WITH A BRUTAL HIROSHI HASE STYLE URANAGE! Immediately hooking the legs right after, Omega only gets 2 ½ to his displeasure, proceeding to let a bit of his own animal out too with nasty stomps all over Punk’s body, yet Kenny still remains the more focused of the two, Callis ensuring he stays in check, Kenny kicking CM’s body to the outside. Dropping to a knee, he drums on the mat in preparation for what he failed to pull off earlier, hitting the ropes once, twice… RISE OF THE TERMINATOR! Punk wiped out, a new surge of adrenaline courses through Omega’s veins, picking CM up onto the apron, where CM does his best to rally with strikes, but it’s no hope for him, KENNY LIFTING HIM UP WITH A DOUBLE UNDERHOOK… PILEDRIVERRRRR!!! Punk’s head crashing against the hardest part of the ring, he’s out like a light as Kenny rolls his limp body back inside, flopping into cover, hooking the near leg, too tired for anything else! 1… 2… PUNK WITH A FOOT ON THE ROPE! CM SURVIVES OUT OF HIS ANIMALISTIC INSTINCT!

Omega looks shocked as ever, the champion failing to keep up with athletically superior challenger, and yet, refusing to go down for the count, now Kenny starting to have his own doubts on whether he can truly dethrone CM or not, the Best in the World a tougher challenge than he’d originally anticipated. And there’s but one move he knows that could put Punk away if he could just land it. Beating Punk down with stomps, Kenny follows with a Standing V-Trigger as CM tries to hold onto his leg to curb his offence, saliva sent flying everywhere from Punk’s mouth! Kenny lines up for the running version, but CM slides out the way, Omega meeting the ropes instead, whilst Punk gets behind for a SAITO SUPLEX, though Omega flips through to his feet, CRUSHING PUNK WITH THE V-TRIGGER! He goes for a third One Winged Angel attempt, though the pain in his arm stops him from getting Punk up, CM going for an Enzu Lariat, but it’s ducked, Omega backsliding Punk through, before throwing the V-TRIGGER again… PUNK CATCHES IT! Patting it down, Punk scores a Mule Kick to double Omega over, before doing the Viva La Raza shoulder shuffle, delivering a Snap Vertical Suplex! Keeping the hold in, he rolls through, delivering a second, the crowd’s anticipation building up as he goes to complete the Three Amigos, but Kenny anchors himself to the ground, blasting away on Punk’s midsection to have him release, a JUMPING V-TRIGGER meeting the standing CM, Omega collapsing on top of him! 1… 2… PUNK STAYS IN IT!

BUT IT’S TIME FOR OMEGA TO FINISH THINGS OFF, FIRING THE FINGER GUN, BEFORE GETTING PUNK UP ON HIS SHOULDERS! Punk fights back all he can, blasting lefts and rights off Omega’s head, doing all he can to faze Kenny, yet the Cleaner stands strong, passing his other arm up higher and higher as he goes to hook the head… BUT PUNK BITES THE HAND IN A LAST-DITCH EFFORT! Omega howls in surprise, CM no longer confined by the regulations of what’s legal, tearing Kenny back down to the mat and locking in the ANACONDA VISE! THE VISE IS IN, THE MOVE THAT BEAT BOTH MOX AND MJF NOW BACK FOR KENNY! The deranged look that’s become commonplace for Punk makes its return, Punk squeezing with all he has to try force the tapout from Kenny, quickly turning everything around from being the sympathetic ‘hero of the people’ underdog, channelling the industry greats in his performances, to the sick, twisted man we’ve seen him devolve into in recent months. This is his championship, he can’t let a member of the self-righteous Elite take it from him, the spotlight doesn’t belong on them. Punk yanks back as far as he can, Omega in serious danger of passing out right here, the referee rushing over to check for a sign, some words, anything to tell him he can keep going. And for a few moments, it truly looks like Kenny is finished, Punk headbutting him in the hold over and over to bust him open… BUT THE ARM RISES FROM OMEGA, WAGGING THE FINGER, SAYING HE’S STILL IN IT!

Callis is losing his mind on the outside right now, begging Kenny to make the ropes somehow, Omega using his inhuman physique to start heading the direction of Don’s voice, as indignation wells in Punk’s eyes. This can’t be possible, he thinks to himself, no one able to fight off his submission like this since his return, but Omega has proven in the past he can make the impossible possible, doing so right here as he crawls bit by bit towards the ropes, Punk doing anything he can to stop him, shaking his head in disbelief… BUT OMEGA MAKES THE ROPES TO SAVE HIMSELF! Punk is on the verge of mental breakdown now as he questions himself what on Earth has been sent his way in the form of a challenger, CM not letting go of the hold, refusing to accept that Kenny got the break, until the referee comes over to him, threatening disqualification. Overprotective about his win-loss record, Punk is only further heartbroken as he lets go at the count of 4, Kenny finally getting a bit of air, Don bringing over a towel to wipe Kenny’s face clean of his blood. But Punk sees red, shoving the referee out the way and yanking Kenny away from Don, adamant to finish this off, right here, right now, as he hauls Kenny onto his shoulders! GO TO SLEEP! Omega collapses in a heap on the mat, Punk a few inches away from him, now dragging himself over with all his might to lay one arm over Kenny’s chest, having the match won right here! 1… 2… 3- NOOOOOOOOO!!! OMEGA KICKS OUT OF THE GTS! OMEGA KEEPS HIMSELF IN THE MATCH! Punk was too exhausted to make a proper cover, allowing Kenny to barely raise one shoulder to stay alive, being the first to kick out of the move since Punk’s return to wrestling!

And Punk… Punk is consumed by sheer stupefaction. Here’s a guy on his last limbs, too tired and hurt to be able to do anything, yet still having the guts to stay in this match. He’s either got the best cardio out of anyone alive, or he’s simply not human. Whatever it is, he cannot let this moment slip from his hands, he thinks to himself. He NEEDS to put Omega down for the count right now, or he may never get a chance quite like this again. Initially trying to pick him up in a headlock, the blood causes Omega’s skin to slip out of Punk’s grasp, forcing him to grand a handful of hair instead to the referee’s dismay, CM dragging Kenny with him over to the ropes, gingerly making the climb to the very top, taking great care of the hurt knee, before looking out over the crowd. His knee may be in no position to nail another GTS, but he has to try this one move he hasn’t hit in a very, very long time for their sakes, still remembering the legion of fans holding up their signs for him back in Chicago against Moxley, believing they’re still out there among the swathes of Elite shirts. Putting Kenny’s head between his legs, he points to the Pepsi tattoo on his shoulder as the crowd begin to realise what he has planned, calling for the very move he used to win the ROH World Championship 15 years ago. PEPSIIIII PLUNGEEEEEE- NO! OMEGA’S FIGHTING BACK! HE’S STILL IN THIS SOMEHOW, PUNK COMPLETELY TAKEN BY SHOCK! KENNY PULLS HIS HEAD OUT FROM BETWEEN THE LEGS AND BOUNCES FOREARMS AGAINST PUNK’S FACE TO STOP HIM IN HIS TRACKS, BEFORE GETTING CM ON HIS SHOULDERS, SWIVELLING HIM AROUND!

mf1lw4q,t3_1iz8u28,"My best guess, at least from my experience as an exec in corporate world (I know these worlds are different, but there are parallels) is that it's likely that it was more than Nico, Mavs owners, Pelinka, and Jeanie.

There were definitely more people in the know, because there is more work to do than just agreeing to the trade. Paperwork has to be filed with the league. I'm sure Nico and Rob are not preparing that paperwork.

Nico doesn't want to do this deal 'alone' so of course he's gonna bring J-Kidd on board secretly, and mention that he will say that J-Kidd had no idea. It was telling to me that Nico let it slip out in the press conference that it would be J-Kidd and Nico's head on the line if they don't win a title within the next few years. There was no reason for him to mention J-Kidd unless he knew about this big trade and, presumably, endorsed it.

I mean for God's sake, Nico is gonna sense check it with the guy (Kidd) who WON a title with AD. There's no way in hell J-Kidd did not know.

JJ Redick knowing the 'day' of the trade that it was going down makes sense. But I'm sure he also knew before as well. Rob is not going in alone either, he's going to be asking JJ, look, we can get Luka. You know Luka. Are you comfortable with this? We're gonna pull the trigger, it's almost done. And *that* conversation didn't happen the day of the trade.

Similarly with Bron, he must have gotten a heads up. The only question remains is if Bron communicated it with Rich Paul. And again, just a guess, I think the answer is yes, because Bron can ensure that AD doesn't know about it through Rich Paul since Bron is Rich's main client. Rich has way more to gain/lose from LeBron than from AD and all of his other clients combined.

If AD fires Rich Paul as his agent, then we'll really know what AD thinks about who knew or not.

If they say NBA is a business, well this is how business is. It's dirty. Lines of friendship/loyalty/camraderie get super blurred. And again, GMs aren't going in alone. They're going to get a consensus from ownership and of course their other 'trusted' people. This often includes head coaches and players.",InclusivePhitness,,3,3,2025-02-27 09:34:03

le4aktg,t3_1e81qlg,"I prefer the Umberto Eco description of fascist characteristics. 

1. The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”

2. The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”

3. The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”

4. Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”

5. Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”

6. Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”

7. The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”

8. The humiliation by the wealth and force of their enemies. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”

9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”

10. Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”

11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”

12. Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”

13. Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”

14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”",p0megranate13,,1037,1037,2024-07-20 18:51:02

le6q1sr,t3_1e81qlg,"Well there are quite a few things you missed, exaggerated on, or are outright wrong about. 
1. Are you saying that you believe the nation is NOT in decline? With rampant homelessness, crime, and inflation through the roof? The country IS in decline. 
2. The line used to designate this “purity” is citizen or non citizen. There are people here ILLEGALLY. He’s not singling out a certain race of people, he’s separating them by legal status, that is a basic protection of the country that should have been provided it’s citizens. 
3. That’s the point of claiming election fraud is that he can’t prove it. The democrats were better at deceiving the public than he is of uncovering it apparently. Are you saying there was zero election fraud? I have heard of several cases where election fraud was sustained. Would it have overturned the election? No, however just because he can’t prove it doesn’t mean it didn’t take place. And ultimately he conceded and left the White House. Nancy Pelosi still claims the election was “stolen” in 2016, so why isn’t she also a “fascist”? 
4. What democratic liberties has Donald trump denied anyone? We are still to have an election, citizens can still vote. I’m not sure I understand the point you are trying to make with that one as all democratic processes are still intact. 
5. How many militarized group member do you think are for trump? Does antifa not count as a militarized group for the democrats? There are easily as many antifa members as any “far right” wing members for trump. The VAST majority of trump supporters cannot be considered far right, so to insinuate that trump supporters are far right is a fallacy. 
6. J6 was instigated by federal provocateurs. The fact that you left this bit out as well as security for the capitol that day fell under democratic supervision says a lot. You are denying even the possibility that this was a staged event perpetrated by the left, instigated by the fbi and understaffed by the democrats who knew what to expect. It certainly was not “led by trump” as you suggest who said peacefully protest at the capitol. 
7. How can you insist trump rhetoric is insinuating violence without at least acknowledging the lefts equally insinuating rhetoric? It’s not like the left are fucking angels and trump words stand out, both sides are guilty of underhanded violet sentiment, with president Biden himself saying we need to put trump in the crosshairs days before an attempt was made on the presidents life. That seems a little more direct toward violence if you ask me. 
Trump is not a fascist, and based on all the things I just pointed out, you have sifted through the evidence and coincidentally omitted items that show you have made a desperate bid to try to prove a fallacy.

le6rnwj,t3_1e81qlg,"Describing whether or not Donald Trump is a fascist involves examining the characteristics of fascism and comparing them to his actions and policies. Fascism, historically defined, includes elements such as authoritarianism, extreme nationalism, suppression of dissent, and a desire for a homogenous society often characterized by dictatorial power.

1. **Elections and Democracy**: Trump participated in democratic elections, both winning and losing. He did not abolish elections or attempt to establish a single-party state.

2. **Free Press**: While Trump has often criticized the media and labeled it as “fake news,” there was no systematic government censorship or elimination of press freedom as seen in fascist regimes.

3. **Political Opposition**: Opposition parties and figures remained active and vocal during Trump’s presidency. Despite his confrontations with opponents, the political system continued to function with checks and balances.

4. **Rule of Law**: The judiciary operated independently during his tenure. Various court rulings, even those unfavorable to Trump, were respected in practice.

5. **Military and Paramilitary Forces**: Trump did not create or use private militias to enforce his will, a common trait in fascist regimes. The military remained under civilian control and did not engage in political repression.

These points suggest that, while Trump exhibited authoritarian tendencies and controversial rhetoric, many of the defining characteristics of fascism were not fully realized during his presidency.",HellaCoolGuy1,,2,2,2024-07-21 05:27:50

“A form of revolutionary ultra-nationalism for national rebirth that is based on a primarily vitalist philosophy, is structured on extreme elitism, mass mobilisation and the leadership principle, positively values violence as an end as well as a means and tends to normalise war and the military virtures.”

Note that racism and anti-left Violence is not included in this definition when perhaps it should be. 

This is what I learnt from my history lecturer on Fascism: 

It explicitly glorifies the nation above all other. There is no universal Fascism, as it is bound specifically to the idea of national rebirth. Therefore it is tied to specific countries. 

In the Nazi case it is also racial in principle. Fascism is overly particularist/exclusionist in contrast to Communism which is universalist.",fartbumheadface,,2,2,2024-07-21 11:55:32

I think fascists have put their ideology onto Trump, and because he's such a malleable force in politics, he's willing to repeat the lines, and push the agenda, because all he wants is the love of the crowd.

These are twenty lessons from the twentieth century I published seven years ago, first as a kind of online declaration, and then, with historical examples, in a pamphlet called On Tyranny.

They were written in advance of the first Trump presidency, and have been used since in the U.S. and around the world.

For those who want democracy and the rule of law in the United States after 2024, I would only add: now is the time to organize, to prepare to win locally and nationally, and to talk not only about what is to be lost but what can be gained.

I wrote On Tyranny in a defensive mode; but freedom is something not only to be defended but to be defined and to be celebrated. As for me, I believe that if we can get through the next year, things could get better. Much better.

For now, three years after Trump’s attempt to end democracy and the rule of law in the United States, a reminder of the lessons. I recall them now in then hope that I won’t have to do so again a year from now.

1. Do not obey in advance.  Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked.  A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do. 

2.  Defend institutions.  It is institutions that help us to preserve decency.  They need our help as well.  Do not speak of “our institutions” unless you make them yours by acting on their behalf.  Institutions do not protect themselves.  They fall one after the other unless each is defended from the beginning.  So choose an institution you care about — a court, a newspaper, a law, a labor union — and take its side.

3. Beware the one-party state.  The parties that remade states and suppressed rivals were not omnipotent from the start.  They exploited a historic moment to make political life impossible for their opponents.  So support the multiple-party system and defend the rules of democratic elections.  Vote in local and state elections while you can.  Consider running for office.

4. Take responsibility for the face of the world.  The symbols of today enable the reality of tomorrow.  Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate.  Do not look away, and do not get used to them.  Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.

5. Remember professional ethics.  When political leaders set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become more important. It is hard to subvert a rule-of-law state without lawyers, or to hold show trials without judges.  Authoritarians need obedient civil servants, and concentration camp directors seek businessmen interested in cheap labor.

6. Be wary of paramilitaries.  When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching with torches and pictures of a leader, the end is nigh.  When the pro-leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the end has come.

7. Be reflective if you must be armed.  If you carry a weapon in public service, may God bless you and keep you.  But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things.  Be ready to say no.

8. Stand out.  Someone has to.  It is easy to follow along.  It can feel strange to do or say something different.  But without that unease, there is no freedom.  Remember Rosa Parks.  The moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.

9. Be kind to our language.  Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does.  Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying.  Make an effort to separate yourself from the internet.  Read books.

10. Believe in truth.  To abandon facts is to abandon freedom.  If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so.  If nothing is true, then all is spectacle.  The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.


11. Investigate.  Figure things out for yourself.  Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media.  Realize that some of what is on the internet is there to harm you.  Learn about sites that investigate propaganda campaigns (some of which come from abroad).  Take responsibility for what you communicate with others.

12. Make eye contact and small talk.  This is not just polite.  It is part of being a citizen and a responsible member of society.  It is also a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down social barriers, and understand whom you should and should not trust.  If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.

13. Practice corporeal politics.  Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen.  Get outside.  Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people.  Make new friends and march with them.

14. Establish a private life.  Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around.  Scrub your computer of malware on a regular basis.  Remember that email is skywriting.  Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less.  Have personal exchanges in person.  For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble.  Tyrants seek the hook on which to hang you.  Try not to have hooks.

15. Contribute to good causes.  Be active in organizations, political or not, that express your own view of life.  Pick a charity or two and set up autopay.  Then you will have made a free choice that supports civil society and helps others to do good.

16. Learn from peers in other countries.  Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends in other countries.  The present difficulties in the United States are an element of a larger trend.  And no country is going to find a solution by itself.  Make sure you and your family have passports.

17. Listen for dangerous words.  Be alert to use of the words “extremism” and “terrorism.”  Be alive to the fatal notions of “emergency” and “exception.”  Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.

18. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives.  Modern tyranny is terror management.  When the terrorist attack comes, remember that authoritarians exploit such events in order to consolidate power.  The sudden disaster that requires the end of checks and balances, the dissolution of opposition parties, the suspension of freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book.  Do not fall for it.

19. Be a patriot.  Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come.  They will need it.

20. Be as courageous as you can.  If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die under tyranny.",RockWallWinesSucks,,2,2,2024-07-21 16:44:26

leb1gfq,t3_1e81qlg,"Fascism is generally characterized by authoritarian nationalism, suppression of political opposition, control of the economy, aggressive militarism, and often includes xenophobia and racism. Here are some points that have led some to describe Donald Trump as exhibiting fascist tendencies:

1. **Authoritarianism**: Trump’s critics argue that his disdain for democratic norms, attacks on the press, and refusal to concede the 2020 election results suggest authoritarian inclinations.

2. **Nationalism and Populism**: His “America First” rhetoric, emphasis on national sovereignty, and policies aimed at curbing immigration align with nationalist and populist ideologies.

3. **Suppression of Opposition**: Trump has frequently attacked political opponents, both verbally and through attempts to leverage legal and governmental powers.

4. **Militarism**: While Trump has not engaged in traditional aggressive militarism, his administration’s rhetoric and actions towards domestic protests, such as the use of federal forces against Black Lives Matter protesters, have been cited as concerning.

5. **Xenophobia and Racism**: Policies such as the travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries, family separations at the border, and inflammatory language about immigrants have been interpreted as xenophobic and racist.",pbutler6163,,2,2,2024-07-22 00:04:21

Trump isn't a fascist, or a racist. 

Republicans demanding voter ID isn't 'racist', nor is it 'fascist'.. Damn near every other country requires an ID to vote but somehow the U.S. is racist because it wants IDs to vote?

It's like you don't even do your own research - you just believe what other people tell you, then scream and cry and refuse to acknowledge facts when someone provides data you don't like that contradicts your position.

It'd be hilarious if it weren't so sad.

  
'Trump was sued because he didn't have enough black people in his apartments'.. Uh huh.. and how many applied? How many qualified? Having a 'black quota' sure sounds racist to me. With most situations involving large corporations, it's cheaper to roll your eyes and pay the fine then spend decades in court trying to fight it since the gov't has unlimited money and can drag cases on nearly indefinitely. This wasn't a criminal charge.

Ya'll ignore how many 'pillars of the black community' praised him for helping in the community but all the sudden he runs for President and he's 'racist'...   Trump along with Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali received the Ellis Island Award.... oh yeah, totally racist.

He wants national sovereignty and to not be invaded by foreign nationals, and somehow that makes him racist? But Japan not wanting foreigners is OK, because they're protecting their culture, right?

Damn near every bit of information is easily disproven, but your lives are so miserable that you have nothing to fight for so you find the first thing you can to fight against to make it seem like it's some huge struggle. When you stand for nothing you fall for anything.

The cases brought against him so far have all been BS. The lady that claimed she was raped is a nutjob, and her description of what supposedly happened was a blatant copy of an episode of a TV show -  a TV show she said she loved and was her favorite that she knew all the episodes to... how convenient.

The criminal charges are ... trumped up.... They turned possible misdemeanor charges into felony charges by falsifying complaints.

You can be a “feminine” man and still be a straight man.

Your clothing, your interests, your outward appearance, your mannerisms…. They do not define your sexuality or gender identity.

People on the internet need to stop hyper fixating on surface level attributes and personality traits and just let…. People be people.

They were talking about their relationship with their mother and said that she should have been proud of them as their daughter. This is where I get confused.

She is a self-confident young woman who is adamantly not currently insterested in romance.

Apparently, that makes her a lesbian - at least according to the religious-leaning parent of one of her friends.  Finally, in exasperation, she looked the man in the eyes and said ""I'm not a lesbian, I'm a thespian!"" And walked away. She says he stopped objecting to her hanging out with his daughter, but now avoids interacting with her directly.

She says it's frustrating to have to field these questions all the time, and why should anyone care?  I told her that with her peers, it might just be checking her gf potential?

Being in the extreme end of either I guess naturally makes you tend to view things in a more black and white manner.  **However**, I would side with the extreme left than the extreme right any day because, in the end, their intentions (as misguided or naive as they can be at times) are coming out of a place of love, tolerance, acceptance, kindness, or compassion whereas the right seems to stem from hate, anger, malice, arrogance, selfishness, superiority, or insecurity and fear. As proven in this case, where when she finally seriously confronted her friends with the truth and explained how toxic, judgmental, stereotyping, dismissive, and disrespectful they were being, they did not double down or get defensive. They were able to self-reflect, acknowledge their actions and take accountability for it and hopefully learned/grew from it, and genuinely apologized to her and made a heartfelt and thoughtful effort to make it up to her and make her feel accepted as her genuine self rather than judged, dismissed, and patronized (cuz it's patronizing to believe you know someone better than they know themselves and trying to force/coerce them into what you think they should be). Those things are not things I believe would come easily to the extreme right (mostly cuz of that whole insecurity and fear thing they have going on).

ln2bv75,t3_1fgir17,"i had a similar inner conflict with my sibling. growing up, my whole family always made fun of me for being fat and chubby. saying pedos wouldn’t even want me because they’d want skinnier kids to kidnap. i’d never get a man to love me because no one loves fat girls and i’d die alone, etc. a majority of this was the harshest from ages 8-15, which pisses me off because looking at photos from then proved to me i was never as repulsive as they made me feel. 

fast forward a decade or so, my sibling has married someone who’s heavier than i was. i had gotten to a point of self acceptance and use humor as a crutch. i tried to show them a funny skit video skit about stress eating and getting fat as the joke and my sibling cringed away, saying they thought jokes like those were offensive. and i was never more pissed at them at that moment. what was all my childhood torment for? how could the opinion change so suddenly? does their spouse know how much i was ridiculed BY my sibling over my weight? they got to point and laugh at me for daring to go swimming and ‘show off my fat’ and now i felt i was being shamed for being able to laugh at myself?? i was so so angry

then i spoke to a psychiatrist during my evaluation for depression, and she pointed out to me that despite being my older sibling, we were both still kids. kids can only behave and imitate what they see around them, and we had my parents. (see my own post history, or don’t. doesn’t matter). 

my parents are who my sibling probably mimicked. once they came into their own as they left for college and found a partner they wanted to settle down with, they had a chance to reform their opinion on many things. and it just made complete sense to me. we have a 6 year age gap between us so the brunt of familial torment and my own self loathing through puberty coincided with my sibling leaving for college. 

i remember that it was a less than 15 minute session with the psychiatrist and i was genuinely shocked at how all of the built up anger and grudge i was holding just, poofed. disappeared almost instantly. i used to keep my guard up around them but not anymore. and id say the relationship with my sibling has never been better ever since.",LurkerBerker,,72,72,2024-09-14 10:29:35

ln4iu17,t3_1fgir17,"My older brother was a drug addict.  While on work release for a cocaine possession charge he stole my identity, emptied my bank account and skipped town.

He was dead to me.

Years later he got back in touch with my mother.   He was on the other side of the country and had gotten himself clean.  I didn't speak with him I didn't want anything to do with him.  He was working.  Actually in a management position.  Didn't care.  I wanted nothing to do with him.  He apologized though my mother and offered to talk.  Didn't care.  I wanted nothing to do with him.

My niece was born.  I was invited to come meet her.   It had been six years since we had spoken.  I drove 17 hours to meet my niece.

Things were tense.  We didn't really talk, not really.   My walls were up, my guard was up.

My brother seemed like a changed man.  We were polite.   Cordial.  But there was a gulf.  

There was no magic moment of forgiveness and reconciliation.  That isn't to say we never reconciled.   It took years.  Favors.   I came down over one winter break to help watch the kid while his wife went through radiation therapy.  Because she couldn't be around the kid.  He didn't press.   He never pressed.   He just lived his life better, I saw him do that.  Eventually I stopped being so guarded around him.  Our relationship improved.  Favors were asked for and done on either side.  A move here.  Some health issues there.

One day I needed support.  I mean absolutely needed it after being in the hospital for 11 days.   He was there for me.

Words are wind.  An apology is easy.  Living it is another matter.  Sometimes you have to cut someone off because it is the right thing to do to protect yourself.   The priority is to protect yourself.  Trust doesn't come easy once someone has broken it.   Forgiveness is real, change is real.   But trust has to be earned when someone breaks it.

ln629qw,t3_1fgir17,"phew. in this case, i'm glad OOP eventually softened his stance. i wouldn't have blamed him for *not* giving his brother a chance, for what it's worth. i think, based on some of OOP's comments, that forgiveness was the right choice *for him.* i totally understand why he initially reacted the way he did. and frankly, one couldn't really blame him for initially wondering if his brother's repentance was genuine. 

i mean, how often have those of us who have been treated cruelly by family members given our tormentors a chance to apologize, only for the 'apology' to continue blaming us for our 'reactions' and 'interpretations', our 'exaggerations' and poor memories? (one of my egg donor's favorite jabs is 'you don't remember things correctly'). or trying to demand retroactive absolution for their previous transgressions, but without ever actually apologizing for said transgressions, but somehow you owe it to them because of 'everythng they've done for you' since. i'd wager that many of us have experienced such a thing. it's such a letdown, and it fills your heart with such a terrible ache.

to me, however, it seems clear that OOP's brother's repentance was genuine. one of the biggest green flags to me was that he never expressed a sense of entitlement to OOP's forgiveness, and in fact immediately accepted not only that his brother may not ever be able to forgive, but that that was his fault. there was no pressure or manipulation to accept the apology on brother's timetable or at all; there was clearly no motive to 'apologize' primarily to keep the peace or satisfy an ultimatum or clean up his own image. he just realized that his conduct had been *terrible*, and realized that that wasn't the person he wanted to be anymore.

the word for 'repent' in the Tanakh, teshuvah, means 'to return.' repentance is more than the mere feeling of remorse. it is the wholehearted acceptance that your conduct caused harm. it is a choice to turn away from harmful conduct and rededicate yourself to your principles. it's a pattern of action demonstrating your genuine desire to make whole what you've broken (inasmuch as it is possible). i believe OOP's brother has demonstrated that.

i sometimes struggle with forgiveness. i have forgiven nearly everyone who's hurt me ... except for an ex who continually hurts our child for the sake of hurting me, and my egg donor, who actively continues to twist the knife. in fact, she's more interested and involved and more determined to exert influence in my life now that i no longer want her to be a part of it than she ever was when i was still desperate and begging for her love, approval, and affection. what i would do, what i would let go, what i would and did sweep under the rug in the hope of building a brighter future for our relationship, if she would just give me a genuine apology for any of it. but i digress.

i have high hopes for OOP and his relationship with his brother. i am glad that his brother apologized & respected that he could not force forgiveness; i am glad that forgiveness has brought OOP so much peace. 🩶",lapetitlis,,2,2,2024-09-14 23:42:45

ln2rwxl,t3_1fgir17,"I mean they were both VERY YOUNG and still are arguably VERY YOUNG.

But bullying leaves scars and its honestly could be a lot harder that one of your biggest bullies happens to be a family member and sibling. Its takes TIME to recover and what I saw was that OOP's brother WASN'T giving OOP time to process things on his timeline. The brother was revving to go when OOP was just getting the news.

Though, I'm not impressed with the brother's apology. Its really just an sort of apology to me. It acknowledges his ""wrongs"". But when he goes into talking about WHY he did that? Nah. That's you trying to get some sympathy for being an asshole and bully. Like sure kids that bully can have it rough at home, but he wasn't one of them. He may have had depression but simply saying that magical phrase or term doesn't mean what he did is any better IMO. It doesn't fix all the bullying he did earlier and when he throws that in his apology, makes it feel less sincere too me.

Also I think what I saw in the boyfriend's behavior is what ""a lot of the older gays"" talk about when they say ""kids don't have it as hard as we did before"". Which is a GOOD THING. Obviously they mean in it in a good way. But they also talk about how a lot of kids still experience the same shit they did as kids. So there's this very wide range of things kids can experience as coming out as being part of any of the LGBTQIA+ communities. Its no longer a give that kid A had the same coming out experience as kid B anymore. Some can come from really metropolitan areas where sure there are homophobes and assholes, but they can find their communities and be insulated from that a lot more than someone who comes from an area that's nothing but homophobic. All that is to say, I don't think the boyfriend really understood HOW BAD some kids can still have it, particularly if you're getting homophobia from at home if he's pulling out ""I'm reconsidering our relationship"". Its tone suggests he hasn't experienced some soul-crushing and deeply scarring homophobia bullying. WHICH IS GOOD. IT'S GREAT but at the same time shows he simply can't empathize or even understand. He was acting and talking like someone who never really experienced bullying before and expecting the victim of bullying to magically be recovered when the bully says ""I'm sorry"". But I'm sorry doesn't make anything go away.

It turned his world upside down, he did a LOT of self reflection, and ended up clearing out a lot of emotional cobwebs from his teenage years.

m5x9kyr,t3_1hvr1n6,"Took my first trip overseas via SCF in 2017, several since, and turned quite a few people on to you, some of which are still subscribers. I truly love your product.


I just wanna say how much I admire you, what you've done, and *how* you've done it. You took a thing you loved and were good at and turned it into a company and career, Free tier subscriptions that are actually useful were a brilliant way to get people to see the value you offer, and paid subscriptions have always been reasonably priced while steadily improving features and offerings. You've avoided the ""enshittification of everything"" so rampant today, and as far as I can tell have dealt quite fairly with your customers (if y'all sold my info to advertisers, I sure can't tell it), offering truly great value. Every AMA I see from you, you're busting your ass to answer everybody personally, rather than some PR turd with a script--even when people were less than kind (I remember a couple years ago there were a lot of ""shill/scam/ripoff"" accusations). You've built your company the ""right"" way, in my opinion, and I applaud you for it. I hope you're making bank, bro.


That said, I do have a question: how concerned are you about Going's future? As you've said, number of mistake fares are falling year by year as airlines get better at preventing or catching them, and while that's the smaller part of your draw, it IS a pretty significant part, I think:  catching one of those feels like hitting the lottery, and gambling is *fun*! Aside from the dwindling mistake fares, though, it seems like your other, primary value proposition could be described as a ""middleman"", connecting buyers with sellers of ""clearance"" fares (those intentionally discounted significantly by carriers, for whatever reason). You've done a tremendous job of building a target audience for those sales by having the audience self-select as interested, but it still seems that, like any middleman, you're in danger of being eliminated if (and when) buyers and sellers grow the ability to make those connections through a different channel, or if those clearance sales change character or cease altogether.


If airlines reduce pricing volatility (maybe by discounting more gradually by smaller amounts, or in a more uniform manner) and/or find a way to inform the appropriate consumers about them themselves (perhaps by creating their own ""outbound airport watchlists"" or the like for their customers), where will that leave SCF? Doesn't it seem both of those things (minimized pricing swings and better internal marketing) would be quite feasible, relatively easy to implement, and result in greater profit for the carriers? Perhaps there's a factor I'm missing, and of course it would take some time to implement, but if they ARE feasible, easy-ish, and profitable, they would seem inevitable eventually. I'm sure you've considered this, so am I reasoning incorrectly, is my understanding flawed, or what do you see as the timetable for such eventualities in the future? And then what do you do?


Have you considered offering your services to carriers as a consultant to help them build out such systems for themselves? ",eudemonist,,3,3,2025-01-07 19:40:37

m5vi3lq,t3_1hvr1n6,"I read through your post and please excuse the scepticism - but those best deals you mention (130$ back in 2013 or so) were back in a time where the world and the industry was quite different.  I myself am a well-experienced traveller and for years now everyone comes to me for help on finding cheap flights.  Some 10 years ago, similarly to what you mention - my best deal was I think $150 between US and Europe, i was so proud of myself till I found out that another frequent-traveller friend booked the same for $140 somehow (i'm still bitter over it haha).  Another time I flew across Europe for $1.69 - and coffee at the airport in Stockholm on arrival cost 10 times more than my flight heh.

That said - nowadays?  I find that it's almost impossible to find meaningfully cheaper prices than what anyone else can find, out in the open.  Usually I'll find something 5-10$ cheaper than most, through some coupon on some obscure third-party service or such, but not much else.  Sure, error fares happen - but they're so rare and the airlines tend to nowadays fix them in seconds rather than days, so it's hard to consider a strike of luck as a ""travel hack"".  By the time 'SecretFlying' or similar sites post any such deal, it's usually long gone already.  Then as for actually finding cheaper flights than whatever the most common search engines show...  Well, first off all - all those search engines that are reasonably good at finding flights are owned by massive companies (or sometimes are just a different-colored copy of each other, like momondo and kayak) - and those companies have gotten really good at offering you just enough incentive to book with them, but to also make sure that any and all meaningful savings go to them, not you.  And then even when you do find some cheaper connections... man, sometimes it's a 60+ hr flight with multiple self-transfers...  I embrace long layovers, but at a certain point it's just not reasonable.

Add to that stupid war and/or political bickering in Middle East and Europe - which means some routes get cancelled or rerouted and some airlines get a pretext for charging more (valid or not).  Then the fact 10 years ago cheap airlines actually had an incentive to be cheap, they were just becoming a thing, there were more route options on 'real' airlines.  Nowadays, all too often real airlines lose too much business so they get rid of/change routes, then the cheap airlines when they have monopoly, they stop being cheap. (yet continue to be inconvenient by for example not offering connecting flights, but just self-transfer options with high potential to miss your connection)

And so I realize that this isn't really a ""question"" - but in my view finding meaningfully cheap, ""hidden"" or ""secret"" deals on flights, is no longer possible, at least not as it used to be some years ago still.  You might at times find a good deal on kayak or google flights, but that's largely luck and it's accessible to anyone, anytime - so it's hardly any kind of travel hack or secret.

Feel free to prove me wrong if you disagree, but either way I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on all this.",EtheriumSky,,3,3,2025-01-07 14:22:13

Now, we have two kids and want to spend an extended summer in Europe - likely in France, Copenhagen, Lisbon/San Sebastian, and Southern Italy. I have a lot of Chase and AA points, and I'm not sure how to optimize coming from SFO. Most AA reward flights are 40-50k one way, have 2 connecting flights + are 16-22h, which sounds like a nightmare with kids. We might fly to the East Coast like nyc first for a few days and hope to catch a direct flight.

I’ve always been curious how y’all set the bar for a “deal”. I think it’s historical averages, but does that update every year depending on what the “typical” price is? For example, I’ve been seeing lots of deals to Japan (I’ve gone twice now, once on a deal I found with Singapore Airlines two hours _before_ I got the Going email, which made me proud 😆), so would that change the price for what a deal is?

Something I’ve always wondered that’s kept me from booking deals from airports other than my home airport: if I book a flight deal out of a bigger airport (let’s say JFK) and book separate flights from my home airport to JFK to get the deal flight, am I restricted to carry on baggage only? I typically like to check a bag on international flights, or at least have the option to, but I’m not sure how to do this if I’m piecing together separate itineraries. 

Is it possible to create or filter a watchlist to only be from certain airports instead of every airport I follow? Since I follow several airports, I often get 30+ deals for my watchlist destinations, but sometimes I’m only looking for a flight from my home airport. I often do a workaround by filtering the whole list of flight deals, but it would be nice to filter the watchlist itself.

First, wanted to tell you I'm a several year subscriber but this year I downgraded to economy only fares. I thought that the truly good business class fares - say, under $2000k - were so rarely available it wasn't worth it. Obviously it's also personal, since I'd rather be able to fly 3x in economy v once in business when push comes to shove. But I was surprised not to see more bargain fares.

  
Second, can you comment on the flight consolidators, like kiwiair and others - I find these are popping up a lot more lately in your emails, and you don't really know it's not a direct with airline price until you come to the end of the process. I feel like you should do something beyond the fine print disclaimer to familiarize yourself with the pros and cons. Usually when I look these companies up, there's one horror story after another about cancellations, double payment, etc. Do you think it should be incumbent on you and your service to provide flight options only from reputable companies?

He’s elected to the senate in 1979. When shortly after, his wife and child are killed. Leaving him with 2 sons without a mom. 

He decided he is going to give it up to raise his kids, only to be encouraged to at least give the senate try. 

So his sister moves in with him and helps raise his kids. As he commutes from Delaware to DC in a train to be a dad and Senator. 

He then goes on to serve 30 years in the senate.  

Then 8 years as Vice President, under our first African American president.  He was also the first major politician to speak out for gay marriage (he said it before Obama). 

Keep in mind, VP is a largely thankless job and is essentially a resume builder to be president. 

But then in 2016. He didn’t run.  He left the gate open for our first woman president. 

Then, he has a child die of brain cancer. 

Joe Biden, who could retire and forever be already known as a great American, decides to run for president as a unifier during one of the most divided times in American politics. in addition,he adds the first woman of color on a major party ticket.

It's been a tough 4 years watching a petulant man child con artist act like every single selfish act as president was somehow backed up by the the will of the people. It never was, and that's why this feels so damn good. We actually managed to come together after a year of infighting over which direction the party should go, and we once again became THE MAJORITY.

gbhdcv1,t3_jptq5n,"I tried to post this in the conservative thread as I'd like to open up a real dialogue, but it's flaired users only there. So I guess I'll post it here:


As a former Republican from Texas, can I please say:

They don't want your guns. Obama was born in America. There were no emails for crooked Hillary, nor were there Mexican gangs roaming the suburbs. There was no Antifa attack. There is no laptop. And there is no voter fraud. 

How many times can someone cry wolf here? They pulled these tactics when I was voting for Bush and it never led anywhere.

There was, however, an investigation that led to multiple Presidential staffers and campaign managers being given prison time for their involvement in the 2016 campaign. 

Why don't Republicans care about this?

The only thing the last administration did was give massive tax cuts to corporations, sever our control on a global scale, and undermined our democracy.

This is not the Republican party I grew up with. This has been a sham and a tarnish on what used to be a party that stood on Christian morals and values. The party has thrown their character to the wind.

The Republican party lost its way when it embraced the misguided lies and got away from policy. I haven't voted Republican in years, but the party has only sank further and further from what it used to be.

I actually hope you guys get it together, as diverse opinions are the embodiment of democracy. I know this will be deleted but I had to get it off my chest. 

I really want us to work together again.

m6qlvcx,t3_1hyz9h3,"Thanks for the writeup and for accepting my suggestion! You did a great job detailing everything that has been reported :) I have no idea what happened to Barbara based on all this information, I truly hope she is okay but unfortunately I don't think that's the case :( 

I will add though that the police handling of this case had some big problems. As you stated, the polygraph interrogation was done in a bad way, considering that the boys answered in Hungarian and an interpreter translated their answers to authorities (ignoring the obvious faults with polygraph testing in general). Furthermore, Barbara's father [stated](https://www.magyarszo.rs/vesti/na/srpskom/a.101921/Barbara-Vitez-je-nestala-pre-godinu-dana) that some parts of the interrogations in the initial stages were conducted in Serbian, which the boys weren't fluent in (apparently without an interpreter), and he feels as though that could have potentially meant that the boys didn't fully understand what the police were asking them, which could account for their different accounts of what happened. I really find it hard to believe that there were no officers who spoke Hungarian and who could have conducted the interrogations in that language, as Senta has a majority of Hungarian inhabitants (about 80% or higher), and I think (although I'm not sure) Hungarian is an official language in this municipality as well as Serbian.

Someone asked in the comments if Serbian police is generally corrupt and/or more ignorant of murders and disappearances of girls and women and the answer is yes. We have a rampant femicide problem, and although the cases where a victim is a young girl are more thoroughly investigated than the cases with an adult woman as a victim, the corruption is still a pretty big problem, so that could have contributed to the mishandling of this case.

Also, in some unrelated [articles](https://gradski.online/nandor-baranji-ronilac-iz-sente-upozorava-u-tisu-i-ovog-leta-skacu-sa-mostova-opasno-i-nepotrebno/) I found that under the bridge that Barbara apparently disappeared from there is a left over metal construction of an old bridge which was destroyed in WW2 - maybe this could have contributed to not finding her body with sonars if it somehow got stuck in this old construction? I'm not an expert by any means but I thought that could be an interesting information to add. I have to say though that there are multiple drownings in this area of the river (some who commited suicide, some who jumped from the bridge for fun and ended up getting hurt and drowning) and their bodies were, as far as I could tell, all recovered. 

As I said, I have no idea what happened to Barbara, but I don't think she ran away and the boys covered it up. Even if she is alive, and the idea is she is in Hungary, she would have had to cross the border illegally, without her passport, and that meant someone had to have helped her. And as many commenters, I don't think the boys would cover up her running away when people started suspecting them of doing something horrible to her...

Polygraphs are meaningless but it seems pretty unlikely that a pair of teenage boys would be this good at lying for this long. 


I'm not too bothered by the accounts of why she fell being different because eyewitnesses (often unconsciously) make stuff up to fill the gaps *all the time*.

The girl in the livestream looks nothing like her- she has a distinctly different nose from hers, as well as a different face shape, eyes and forehead among other things. The sighting in the hospital in Budapest sounds untrue as well. No way several people would recognize her here at once ( there really wasn’t a lot of press on her) and the only sights that published the story are VERY unreliable pages that specialize in smear campaigns against hungarian “celebrities”.

m74tu99,t3_1hyz9h3,"Things I'd like to know:

- Who last saw Barbara *before* the boys filed the report? When? What was her situation like then?
- How did she feel about attending the party beforehand?
- What was her relationship with these boys? How long had she known them and them her? How did she feel about them and them her?
- What was Barbara's home life like? Did she get along with her parents? Any evidence of anything that would make her not want to live there? Did she have any interest/ambition to travel?

For the first two points, we need interviews with all the people who saw her at the party.

The fact that she wouldn't climb on the bridge is pretty believable, if she was afraid of heights (Even if she wasn't afraid of heights, climbing out on a bridge above a cold river at night is something generally reserved for people who are known ""thrill seekers""). Plus, the reason given by the boys initially is very suspicious: That bridge looks like it's designed for vehicles. Way too wide for two people to make someone feel they need to climb outside the railings to ""get around"". That explanation seems very much like something that someone would come up with hastily. So I would have assumed that she wasn't climbing on that bridge willingly, even without her parents saying she was afraid of heights.

If she did die that night, I think the boys definitely know something about it that they're not telling. Either it was a tragic accident and they are covering because they think they're somehow culpable, or they did something to her. I think the latter is less likely, because her body probably would have turned up in all the years since (Even if the whole bridge story was a complete ruse and they did something else with her in the area).

The theory that she ran away is fairly compelling given the family's insistence that certain sightings were definitely her. But they are desperate for her to be alive, so it's still possible that those sightings just weren't her.

I think my last point above is the most important. If she did run away, there would be something extreme enough to make her want to do so. There's no way to thoroughly investigate this case without thoroughly investigating that angle.

Hey, we all have bad days, perhaps that was just one of yours! I really enjoy reading your posts, and this one \[edit to add 'today'\] today was particularly well-presented.

I'm not one to immediately say that a young teenage girl who goes missing has been trafficked, but this one does seem like a real possibility. First, this took place in Eastern Europe, and this UN Report [https://www.unodc.org/documents/publications/TiP\_Europe\_EN\_LORES.pdf](https://www.unodc.org/documents/publications/TiP_Europe_EN_LORES.pdf) cites the Balkans (which includes Serbia) as a particular hot spot for this kind of activity. Also, the reluctance of local police to offer meaningful help to Barbara's parents, the lack of a body, the changing/different stories of the two boys who were accompanying Barbara that night, and the multiple sightings lead me to think of something along the lines of trafficking.",jmpur,,7,7,2025-01-12 02:08:44

m6owrwa,t3_1hyz9h3,"The night she went missing Barbara went to her very first party. Some kid her age was celebrating birthday at the local caffe which is very common in Serbia. The caffe was owned by an adult man who was present there that night and he wasn't the only older guy over tehre. Also keep in mind that pretty much every caffe and club has its own security composed of shady guys (local criminals and dealers, football hooligans).

I don't believe that Barbara ever was at the bridge. There are zero evidence she was there except the testimony of the boys who lawyered up very quickly. She most probably was drugged, raped and killed. Police never questioned the caffe owner or any other of the adults who were at the party. I believe that the boys targeted her and brought her to the party for the older guys to have some fun. I bet she wasn't the first one but she was the first who threatened to call the police or maybe had some sort of a mental breakdown after being gang raped so they panicked and killed her.

As much as Serbian police is incompetent they have ways to exctract confession but the guys who are involved are protected and Barbara comes from very poor family. A few years after Barbara went missing her older brother died. Nor people nor God were merciful to Vitez family.

Trafficking would explain a lot: Corrupt local police working with the criminals and on their paycheck (I remember there was even a case where UN forces was involved in prostitution and trafficking in the area), the tip about laced coca-cola, no body, sightings in chat rooms and night clubs, sightings in Romania (infamous for trafficking).

Were the boys parents influential? The time of reporting the incident could be a clerical error. Why would police inform parents of this horrific news without first going to the bridge? My guess is that she's buried not far from where she was killed or police transported the body to a undisclosed location to protect the kids.

Alcoholism, drug addiction, domestic abuse are all indicators that the now men are carrying guilt. If the boys are still living in the area, it might be worthwhile for the parents to slowly drive by their residences. Keep driving by to let them know their behavior was/is suspicious. If they have moved, enlist the authorities in the new locations to help. It can take years but one of them will eventually crack. My prayers 🙏 go out to the girls family and friends.

In the video by Republican Del. Derrick Evans, later deleted from his social media page, he is shown wearing a helmet and clamoring at the door to breach the building in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.

“We’re in! Keep it moving, baby!” he said in a packed doorway amid Trump followers holding flags and complaining of being pepper sprayed. Once inside, Evans could be seen on video milling around the Capitol Rotunda, where historical paintings depict the republic’s founding, and yelled, “No vandalizing!”

State House of Delegates Speaker Roger Hanshaw said Evans will need to “answer to his constituents and colleagues regarding his involvement in what has occurred today.”

Ruby Bridges who was one of the first black children in Louisiana to go to a desegregated school and had to have US marshals escort her in though. There were protests and riots waiting for them and screaming racial slurs at a 6 year old. 

White parents were so angry they withdrew their children from the school. This was in 1960 and Ruby is 66 years old. The first major civil rights act was in 1964 and it took a second one in 1968 for things to even START rolling. 

MLK was killed in 1968. There are people who probably participated in these race riots that are still alive and in power. Hell the southern Strategy of republicans using “Racial anxiety” to gain support started in 1963. 

Oh and to go back even further the south was never really punished for the civil war and most of them eventually ran for public office again. Trump is only a small part of the puzzle but he is the end result of all that racial propaganda. He represents who the republicans back then were targeting. 

Him being president is basically the result of years of racial tension. It’s why he was a direct response to Obama becoming president.

Yes there was some violence and chaos during the summer. That was absolutely unjustified and wrong: in some cases it was just opportunistic crime and vandalism and some to be fair was also protesters. 

However a handy guide to the differences for anyone who has to argue with these morons:

 - The Maga rioters are protesting to overturn a free election; the BLM protesters were protesting racism and a murder
- the cause today is based on utter lies
- the violence in the summer saw urban chaos, shops being burned - and that’s certainly bad - but it’s nothing close to storming Congress during the certification of an election 
- the leading voices and political leadership of the American left were not inciting and supporting the violence; Trump and a large portion of the gop are

History will rightly remember today's violence at the Capitol, incited by a sitting president who has continued to baselessly lie about the outcome of a lawful election, as a moment of great dishonor and shame for our nation. But we'd be kidding ourselves if we treated it as a total surprise. 

For two months now, a political party and its accompanying media ecosystem has too often been unwilling to tell their followers the truth — that this was not a particularly close election and that President-Elect Biden will be inaugurated on January 20. Their fantasy narrative has spiraled further and further from reality, and it builds upon years of sown resentments. Now we're seeing the consequences, whipped up into a violent crescendo. 

Right now, Republican leaders have a choice made clear in the desecrated chambers of democracy. They can continue down this road and keep stoking the raging fires. Or they can choose reality and take the first steps toward extinguishing the flames. They can choose America. 

I've been heartened to see many members of the President's party speak up forcefully today. Their voices add to the examples of Republican state and local election officials in states like Georgia who've refused to be intimidated and have discharged their duties honorably. We need more leaders like these — right now and in the days, weeks, and months ahead as President-Elect Biden works to restore a common purpose to our politics. It's up to all of us as Americans, regardless of party, to support him in that goal.",coasterghost,,49,49,2021-01-07 01:04:26

The Constitution allows for a super majority of the Senate to remove a president from office but if they decline to do that, you are right, the president can go on as usual. **​Any consequences would be up to the voters.** We have never had a president, impeached but not removed, face reelection.

1. Republicans didn’t get to call witnesses.

False. They called Volker and Morrison. The witnesses they wanted were 1. The whistleblower, which would have dissuaded future whistleblowers, exactly what they want. 2. Schiff, which honestly I would have liked, but he’s obviously not a relevent witness to Trump’s corruption. 3. Any Biden. This is literally just furthering Trump’s agenda to make Biden look guilty.

2. Democrats have been trying to impeach Trump since day one. 

Yes. He’s been corrupt since day one. I would have began the impeachment process the day he said that White Supremacists are “very fine people” or the day he sided with Putin over our own intelligence. Yes, he’s been a terrible president for the duration of his tenure. 

3. No “direct evidence”. All hearsay.

The whistleblower’s testimony was completely corroborated by 17 witnesses, many in closed door hearings as to not let the varying testimonies influence others. Unsubstantiated is the key word for evidence to be hearsay. Every single piece of evidence is corroborated by other testimony.

4. But the jobs and the economy.

Literally a direct continuation of the trend set by the Obama administration. In fact, to continue the trend set by the Obama administration the unemployment rate should be even lower. Obviously that’s not entirely fair, but there is very little evidence to support any of Trump’s policies had any effect on anything he purports he improved.

Until 2016 I genuinely never knew what it felt like to be failed in a big, systemic way by our society and its political and judicial processes, which were designed with me in mind. 

Damn near every day since then, most Americans with a clue have felt some form of anger, frustration, anxiety or sadness as we've watched our president and those we've chosen to hold him accountable to us fail time and again to stop the injustices. We've seen Donald Trump and his administration persecute and attack many of our nation's marginalized populations, largely without consequence. The feeling of genuine hopelessness I've felt at times watching the events of the last few years unfold has helped me to understand, just a little bit, what it has been like to be a minority in America for a long, long time - same shit, different day, no logical reason and no sign of changing. It hasn't been until now, this moment in time, when it's been decided that his actions are harming *all* of us, that our leadership has decided to push back in a meaningful way. 

This process has been long and frustrating to watch but damn if I'm not glad to see someone standing up and demanding that Trump be held to account. Saying that it's all for naught if he'll just be acquitted in the Senate is like saying we shouldn't put cops on trial for killing innocent civilians when we know they'll be investigated by their peers and more than likely walk away unscathed. The result of the process will be frustrating, infuriating even, but it's not without a purpose. 

Systemic change in America has only ever been brought about when injustice mattered enough to the people that they were willing to sacrifice something to fight it. We're not there yet as a nation, and we likely won't be there the day that Trump is tried and acquitted in the Senate, but as awful as that day is going to feel for many of us, it will be a step in the right direction. Life in America is bigger than politics or politicians, though we've allowed them to become the end all and be all for far too long. Pushing back against Trump, even when it feels futile, is the most American thing that we can do, and even if we expect the system to fail us, we ought to be supportive of those willing to fail with us.

Not just when he visits (distasteful but if properly divested could be given a pass) - he's made military overseas stay at his properties even if they have to go out of their way to do so. 

He hasn't stopped doing it either! Its ongoing! That is a flat out, black & white, undisputable violation of the Emoluments Clause. But point that out to the GOP and its the same answer: ""So what?""",athornton79,,269,269,2019-12-10 14:40:59

faefx8e,t3_e8r774,"Write your Representatives and your Senators.  This is my letter (My Rep is a Democrat) :

Like anyone who believes in upholding the law, I'm sure that you support bringing charges against the President for the listed crimes of Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Power. While I wish this wasn't the case, many are trying to make this a partisan  issue rather than one regarding the law and of accountability. ​

​While I trust you to do the right thing for us, there is a much more daunting task. Those opposed to holding our president accountable for his actions seem to be doing so out of their own self interests (or self-preservation), for loyalty to party, or  for loyalty to President Trump. No member of Congress, regardless of their political affiliation, owes any loyalty to the President, except loyalty equal to that he shows this country. (To paraphrase President Theodore Roosevelt). ​

​I strongly urge you to reach across the aisle to those who feel this way and remind them that this is not the case. Remind your fellow Representatives that they are not under the President. Remind them that when they swore an oath of office, that the oath  is taken to the Constitution; not to any individual, party or position. ​

​That very same Constitution specifically creates a system of checks and balances. The three branches of government are co-equal; it is not tiered, there is no pyramid of hierarchy. If Congress does not act, if you and your fellow representatives do not  fulfill your Constitutional duty, then we are saying this is okay. You are saying that we have lifted and exalted the position of the President as one that is untouchable, no matter the act. Both the House AND the Senate must realize they are effectively stripping  themselves of a power that leaves this and any future president unchecked. You will be neutering yourselves into a position that his country may not recover from until someone even potentially more despotic than President Trump comes and destroys us.

We were in the car once and my sister brought up the impeachment and my dad turned off CNN, called it fake news, and turned on Fox and said it wasn't biased. He even said that if Trump is impeached he can run again next year. I don't know if that's true or not but I assume a lot of holes would need to be jumped through.

In his conduct of the office of President of the United States—and in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed—Donald J. Trump has abused the powers of the Presidency, in that:  
>  
>Using the powers of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election. He did so through a scheme or course of conduct that included soliciting the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations that would benefit his reelection, harm the election prospects of a political opponent, and influence the 2020 United States Presidential election to his advantage. President Trump also sought to pressure the Government of Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official United States Government acts of significant value to Ukraine on its public announcement of the investigations. President Trump engaged in this scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit. In so doing, President Trump used the powers of the Presidency in a manner that compromised the national security of the United States and undermined the integrity of the United States democratic process. He thus ignored and injured the interests of the Nation.

>(1) President Trump—acting both directly and through his agents Within and Outside the United States Government?corruptly solicited the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into—

(B) a discredited theory promoted by Russia alleging that Ukraine—rather than Russia—interfered in the 2016 United States Presidential election.  
>  
>(2) With the same corrupt motives, President Trump—acting both directly and through his agents within and outside the United States Government—conditioned two official acts on the public announcements that he had requested—  
>  
>(A) the release of $391 million of United States taxpayer funds that Congress had appropriated on a bipartisan basis for the purpose of providing vital military and security assistance to Ukraine to oppose Russian aggression and which President Trump had ordered suspended; and  
(B) a head of state meeting at the White House, which the President of Ukraine sought to demonstrate continued United States support for the Government of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression.

He has also betrayed the Nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections.

>Wherefore President Trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law.

It just seems like the republicans are better off taking the L and letting trump get impeached so that in the future they can vote a better republican president into office. I feel like Trump is going to end up pushing republicans out of the favor of the majority in the US.

Had Obama in 2012 stood in the way of congress approved aid to a foreign nation in exchange for the public statement of their government initiating an investigation of Romney, Republicans would have flipped their lid (and rightfully so).  Once this became known, if Obama would have released the aid and been like Nevermind does that make it all better? Even if Romney deserved to be investigated, does that make Obama trying to force it leading into an election year appropriate?

fae1pgf,t3_e8r774,"70,000 children have been separated from their parents at the border, forced to sleep on concrete floors, denied basic hygiene and medical care.  A Trump admin lawyer stood in front of a court and argued that children don't require a bed or blankets or a toothbrush to be healthy.  This policy was enacted with no plan to ever reunite the children with their families.  In fact, we don't even know what happened to a lot of these kids.

Trump and the Republicans raised taxes on the middle and lower class in order to cut them for the rich.  They are cutting food assistance from millions of Americans and have gutted healthcare.

Trump has isolated us from our allies, abandoning agreements designed to create a safer world.  Every action he has taken on the world stage, from withdrawing in Syria to starving Ukraine of funds and giving them missiles they're not even allowed to use, has been to the benefit of one country and one country only: Russia.

Russia attacked our election in 2016.  They attacked our election in 2018.  The Democrats in the House voted to secure our democracy, but the Republican party has refused to take that issue up for a vote in the Senate.  In spite of a unanimous consensus from our intelligence agencies, the Republicans continue to spout discredited conspiracy theories that absolve Russia and instead implicate Ukraine, a critical American ally again Russia's global aggression.

If you've read this far, thank you.  Now, my point.  Nobody is on the fence.  There's no such thing as an undecided voter.  If anybody can look at what Trump and the GOP has done to this country and what they've cost us in debt, in credibility, in security, in conscience, if anybody can look at all that and claim they don't know who they'll vote for, they're voting Republican, they're just too ashamed to admit it.  And they should be ashamed.  

Impeachment isn't going to cost Democrats anything.  Nobody is switching sides here.  The lines are drawn and the next election is going to be a test of whether the Democrats can turn out enough votes to nullify the Russian attacks that the Republican party has facilitated.",guns_mahoney,,112,112,2019-12-10 15:29:25

He highlighted that our founding fathers gave us everything we need to weather this if we choose to use it. I just went back and read that speech looking for the quote and it is haunting. Obama knew so much more than he could say. Assuming history is written by the victor and our constitution survives, Obama’s speech will be such a historical moment. 

The whole speech is worth a read, but here’s an excerpt:
>> And all of this depends on our participation; on each of us accepting the responsibility of citizenship, regardless of which way the pendulum of power swings.

>>Our Constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift. But it's really just a piece of parchment. It has no power on its own. We, the people, give it power - with our participation, and the choices we make. Whether or not we stand up for our freedoms. Whether or not we respect and enforce the rule of law. America is no fragile thing. But the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured.

>>In his own farewell address, George Washington wrote that self-government is the underpinning of our safety, prosperity, and liberty, but ""from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken.to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth;"" that we should preserve it with ""jealous anxiety;"" that we should reject ""the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties"" that make us one.

>>We weaken those ties when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people of good character are turned off from public service; so coarse with rancor that Americans with whom we disagree are not just misguided, but somehow malevolent. We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others; when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt, and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them.

>>It falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy; to embrace the joyous task we've been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours. Because for all our outward differences, we all share the same proud title: Citizen.

faekply,t3_e8r774,"Write your Representatives and your Senators! This is my letter to both my Senators (Both Democrats):

Senator \*\*\*\*\*\*\*,

&#x200B;

The House of Representatives will likely soon impeach the President; bringing charges against him for Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Power. As a Senator, your job will be as a juror to these charges. The evidence seems almost overwhelming towards guilt. However, it is not my job to make that determination: It is yours. Yours, along with 99 other Senators that hold the fate of our nation in your hands. In cases of criminal or civil trials we expect jurors to be impartial, for them to decide the fate of the accused with the evidence presented. While I wish this wasn't the case, many are trying to make this a partisan issue rather than one regarding the law and of accountability. Many seemingly have decide guilt or innocence already. This is unacceptable. ​

&#x200B;

While I trust you to do the right thing for us, there is a much more daunting task. Those opposed to holding our president accountable for his actions seem to be doing so out of their own self interests (or self-preservation), for loyalty to party, or for loyalty to President Trump. No member of the Senate, regardless of their political affiliation, owes any loyalty to the President, except loyalty equal to that he shows this country. (To paraphrase President Theodore Roosevelt). ​

&#x200B;

I strongly urge you to reach across the aisle to those who feel this way and remind them that this is not the case. Remind your fellow Senators that they are not under the President. Remind them that when they swore an oath of office, that the oath is taken to the Constitution; not to any individual, party or position. ​

&#x200B;

That very same Constitution specifically creates a system of checks and balances. The three branches of government are co-equal; it is not tiered, there is no pyramid of hierarchy. If the Senate does not act, if you and your fellow Senators do not fulfill your Constitutional duty, then we are saying this is okay. You are saying that we have lifted and exalted the position of the President as one that is untouchable, no matter the act. Both the House AND the Senate must realize they are effectively stripping themselves of a power that leaves this and any future president unchecked. You will be neutering yourselves into a position that his country may not recover from until someone even potentially more despotic than President Trump comes and destroys us. This frightens me, not just for myself, but for my fellow Americans, now and in the future. ​

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time Senator.",darkfoxfire,,42,42,2019-12-10 18:32:01

How many of them do you think will be returning to vote for him in '20?

I hate to break it to you but many of them aren't coming back.

Many swing voters have been disgusted by Trump's lack of presidential behavior. He's going to lose a lot of those on-the-fence voters.

The Republican party's war on women over the last two years is also going to greatly motivate many women to vote against Trump.

On top of that you have a lot of kids, from 18 - early 20s, who didn't vote the last election, who will be voting this time. And they are pissed. They care about college tuition, health care, climate change and school shootings.

Then you're going to have Democrats and independents who are enraged by the Republican party's unabashed lawlessness.

The voters were pissed by Dubya & Cheney's ineptitude, failed two wars and corruption, which resulted in the Dems getting the house in '06 and the White House, house and a super majority in the senate in '08.

Don't forget we have another year of Trump being Trump. As soon as Barr buried the Mueller report, Trump immediately felt enabled to extort Ukraine. If the senate doesn't vote Trump out, he's going to feel even more enabled to continue with his lawlessness.

There's going to be a huge push back the 19% (and falling) won't be able to overcome.

Assuming an average of a couple hours for a movie, OP spent less than 400 hours on this hobby. Throw in previews and travel time and we'll call it 500. Many of you would probably be surprised at what you spend 500 hours a year doing (*ahem* Reddit?).

The AVERAGE American adult watches over 5 hours of television a DAY according to Nielsen. So it's quite possible, even likely, that some of you saying that these things are watching TV for 3x as much time as OP watches movies.  That's way, way more TV than I watch, but I don't go around scolding or commenting on the typical person's viewing habits. 

OP has nicely accepted the jabs and responded politely. But even if the point was valid (all the implications that OP has ""too much time on his hands and gee, it must be nice, wish I could do that""), it is rude to point it out and likely that you waste an equal amount of time on something less worthwhile, but the point is not even valid.

fcgx506,t3_eh71gy,"Looking through your ratings from this year and last I think we are pretty similar on the way I would rate most things. One I really have a strong disagreement with is *Climax*. I saw this in the theater and loved it so much. I can see how it would be divisive, but I thought it had so many things that drew me in. On a superficial level it was so erotic, especially at the beginning, in such an inclusive way (guys with girls; guys with guys; girls with girls) which made for good guilty pleasure viewing. Then it took stuff way too far, at various points you thought this looks so fun I want to join, then some stuff happens that’s borderline, makes you squirm a bit, then there is shit that is just horrifying and makes you almost want to leave the theater. The stuff that happened >! with the kid and the woman who was pregnant !< was the absolute worst and I could barely stand to watch. I went in stone sober, and came out feeling like I’d just gone through a bad trip, that’s how engrossed I was in what was happening.

Anyway, I think Gaspar Noe is one of those people, who if you go along for the ride it is a serious trip (e.g. Enter the Void and Climax, for me) and if you don’t get sucked in it is so awful and unbearably pretentious it’s borderline unwatchable (e.g. Love; god that was terrible).

fch3keu,t3_eh71gy,"(mild spoilers ahead) Monos was far and a way the best I’ve seen in a Cinema this year (still waiting for a load of films to release here in the UK), but I’d say Marriage Story matches it if I’m including Netflix/streaming stuff. 

Monos is just a beautiful film. The first half has some breathtaking shots of the surrounding mountains and sky and the cinematography is some of the best in recent years across all film. The score by Mica Levi is also serene at points but builds tension incredibly, especially the recurring elements from the track Lobo y Lady. The performances from a cast of mostly first time actors doesn’t really have a standout (though I’d say Moises Arias was my favourite) but has some incredible emotional moments, the main ones that come to mind is the washing scene by the Riverbank which culminates in a gruesome strangling, or when when Smurf pleads to be set free by the Doctor. 

Only issue I have (it might not even be a real problem I have with the film) is that it feels quite raw. A lot of that is due to the first time actors and a fairly basic plot. There’s no exposition (not necessarily a bad thing) which means you are kind of just dropped into things.  

I’ve seen it likened to Apocalypse Now and I agree, but I believe it feels more akin to Lord of the Flies crossed with an incredibly tense but vibrant fever dream. I’m glad it’s gained some degree of attention and I hope more people will see it at some point.",ENP445,,3,3,2019-12-29 19:15:16

2. Perfume. I cannot stress this enough, PLEASE do not bathe in perfume. A spritz here or there is fine, but if I can still smell your perfume in the elevator from last night then it’s too much and unacceptable. Not everyone enjoys the same scents you do.

However, there are a couple of things in your post that I think could be honest mistakes like someone quickly stopping because they realize they're going the wrong way. That's a reflex, and I think a little grace is okay here. Also, drinking a glass a water before realizing the restaurant isn't going to work for you (for whatever reason) is not a big deal especially if the person apologizes for the inconvenience. The luggage on the train.... I don't know about this one either. I looked at the recommended hours to avoid the train and they were from 7-10AM and from 4-7PM, that is a huge chunk of the day and you can't always plan around these hours.

 disagree with luggage on local trains. Even in nyc, where I’m from, I’d take my suitcase during rush hour to my work if I had a flight after or whatever.

Your list all seems very common sense but it is worth repeating.

Edit: Obviously you’re a “tourist” while touring another place by definition but it a difference in attitudes. It does not make you superior to think of yourself as someone who travels and looks at the sights. By definition you can exchange traveler and tourist. I’m not saying tourists are tacky or gross or that all people should be lumped into the badly behaving tourist trope.

mmuq5hk,t3_1jtf79d,"I love the OP’s list but I think the points regarding luggage in trains and causing obstructions in the middle of walkways / stairways, while generally a good idea in all cities, makes especially good sense in Japan’s biggest and busiest cities eg. Tokyo and Osaka for 2 very specific reasons: 1) Tokyo and Osaka for example are 2 very densely packed and busy cities especially at rush hour. But then again, it’s no more busy than NYC, London, Bangkok, Jakarta, Singapore, Seoul, Beijing or Shanghai. 2) Japanese society expects its members to exemplify the ethos of “The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one”. That’s why a city like Tokyo and Osaka can feel so much cleaner, quieter, safer and more orderly than any of the other big cities I listed (I’ve lived in one of those for many years and visited all the others many times) - cos each member of Japanese society needs to play its part while not inconveniencing its other members. So, for example, yes, the Tokyo/Osaka subway is constructed to carry all kinds of people including residents & tourists with big pieces of luggage. But 95% of Japanese would not travel with big luggage during rush hour on the subway cos of the inconvenience it would cause others and the embarrassment they would feel as a result. As tourists, it would not be unreasonable to follow this practice as well. Same for walking single file on sidewalks or not stopping in the middle of the walkway suddenly.

I think with trains the people should not be blocking the entry/exits but I don't believe it is equally right to force people to take a different mode of transport. Not everyone has the same budget. Especially if some people are saying sorry and doing their best to minimise disruption with their luggage in their best way as possible. The issue with overpacked trains is larger than just tourism fault.

If you are suffering from overtourism (which I think you are), then you really need to start limiting the amount of tourists into your country and make it a lot harder. Charge tourists more for trains if you wish , charge a ""luggage"" fee if you wish (to make it same price as cabs is a great way). Try a dynamic luggage fee. Want to take luggage when trains are packed? $X per luggage (it'll move people to taking cabs).

Also, your train system during peak hour is already difficult enough with no tourists, let alone luggage. It is simply therefore, not a luggage issue albeit it makes it worse!

In the major cities you find out very quickly when peak hour on public transport is and it isn’t pleasant. For example, when I first moved to Japan I had lots of free time and planned my commute around peak hour even tho I had no luggage just because it was that packed.

The reality is that older players simply tend to burn out and become either incapable of putting in enough hours of practice to stay competitive or simply aren't focused enough to get the most of the hours they do put in. Possibly both.

And yes, there's the occasional case of injury, but that is definitely not the norm either, and is usually something that could have been prevented with proper care, but seeing as most new talent grinds their ass off in their teenage years before any real oversight is in place, it's not surprising some manage to injure themselves.

The bottom line is that technically, there's absolutely no reason why someone who's sufficiently motivated and focused, and takes care of themselves, couldn't be a top tier pro into their 30's or 40's even, let alone mid 20's. 

But yeah, you can only put in so many 12+ hour workdays, year after year, until your eyes glaze over and your brain turns into mush.
