Argentina wanted it way more, and had a brilliant first half and ET. Enzo and Mac Allister impressed me the most, they will be stalwarts in their midfield for years.

Mbappe, take a bow. Holy shit what a player, what a menace. He will be have a stronghold on the Ballon d‚Äôor for the next decade.

And lastly, Lionel Messi‚Ä¶first time I watched him was Chelsea-Barcelona 2006 UCL QF. Instantly became my favourite player, followed his career and saw his rise to become the greatest ever.

j0s49po,t3_zp43wc,"Messi is the main character of football. Born with HGH deficiency with a good chance he might not even play football unless he's given super expensive injections which he couldn't afford. But his talent gave him a contract with Barcelona. Got a red card in his first game for Argentina. But he slowly rose up into one of the best players in the world eventually become *the* best. He carries his team to the World Cup final in 2014 but his team just isn't good enough to support him. So close to the one trophy he values the most but is out of his reach. Heart break. Won everything for his club but people called him a fraud for not winning anything with his national team.

He decides he can't take it anymore and quits. But changes his decision. Suddenly he learns that the club that gave him everything can't re sign him because of financial regulations. This is the lowest point of his career and the point where the main character is the weakest.

He finally manages to win Copa America and prove he's still not finished. He's still one of the best. He finds an unlikely new team in PSG. Even though he struggles in the first season, soon he adapts and starts an amazing run of form in the next season. His starts his last ever World Cup but immediately is hit with a setback when they lose to Saudi Arabia. He's subject to jokes and ridicule all around the world. But they come back stronger. And even stronger in the next game. And even stronger still in the one after that. Meanwhile on the other side of the bracket France is running amok amount their opponents and look genuinely unstoppable. France is the final boss.

They meet in the final. His very last World Cup game. It's all or nothing. His team goes up 2-0 and dominate France for a good 75 minutes. But Mbappe scores a double and pulls France back in the game. Messi tries his all and scores another goal in extra time. But Mbappe isn't going to let it end so easily. He equalizes immediately. The match is going to penalties. Now at this point Messi can't do it himself. He needs his teammates to show up. But unlike 2014 this team is different. They're hungrier. They want to fight. They won't give up so easily.

Messi does his part. He converts his penalty kick. Now all he can do is wait...

His teammates finally do it. They win it. They beat the final boss. The unstoppable juggernaut, France. They do it for Argentina and for Messi. Messi on his last World Cup game wins the biggest trophy in the world. The one he coveted above all else. He wins *the* trophy.

j0qp0jv,t3_zp43wc,"This was the **FINAL.** I don't think I've ever witnessed an international game like this. Let's see:

* From Argentina's 36 game unbeaten streak to losing the first WC match to Saudi to mounting a come-back and defeating everyone on the way to the final, led by Messi.
* From France's dominance in every game leading up to the final, led by Mbappe. Despite missing Kante, Pogba and Benzema. Written off initially but went through their games unphased.
* Argentina dominating the first 75 minutes while France couldn't get their bearings before two successive goals from Mbappe to equalize. Messi with a last minute shot that Lloris saves like a beast.
* Messi coming clutch in ET to snatch the lead once again on the heels of a rejuvenated France before Mbappe converted yet another penalty in the 118'. Martinez with another clutch save as well.
* After 2 successive comebacks, a penalty shoot-out where, Argentina, despite all signs pointing towards a mental choke having come this far manages to convert all their penalties while Martinez pulls off yet another elite PK performance.
* Messi winning the WC in his last ever WC appearance, after willing his team to a final and scoring 2 goals in the final. Safe to say he's the undisputed modern-era GOAT and can finally rest knowing he's won it all.
* Mbappe showing us why he's one of the future greats and an absolute phenom. A hat-trick in the final. Literally the only thing that stood between Argentina and the trophy. To have 11 WC goals in 2 WC's having already won one and nearly single-handedly winning another at the age of 23 shows why he is truly elite. I truly feel bad but excited to see this guy break records.
* GK's showing why they matter. Both Lloris and Martinez were fucking immense. Penalties are always a tough one but being able to make critical saves in open-play and in shoot-outs is testament to how good these guys were today.

Truly an emotional roller-coaster and an insane WC final from what most thought was a one-sided game. But that's why this is the best **fucking game** and no sport will top it for me.",SovietSpectre,,63,63,2022-12-18 18:29:01

While some of the money might be lost to corruption, and tons of people think all that spending is for useless boondoggles, perhaps it could be thought of as an investment as well.

In addition to building all sorts of new and modern infrastructure, Qatar also needs to build an image. They‚Äôre currently rich from oil wealth, but that oil won‚Äôt last forever. To ensure Qatar has a future, they need to sell an image of being a modern, developed, cosmopolitan, and business-friendly place with modern infrastructure and amenities in order to attract business, tourism, or investment to their corner of the Arabian desert in order to have any semblance of a future that doesn‚Äôt involve complete civilizational collapse.

(Part involving Germany, google translated)

2006 Germany

The myth persisted for a long time that Germany owed the World Cup to Franz Beckenbauer's golf club diplomacy. Anyone who knows FIFA has never believed it. Martin Sonneborn 's faxes and cuckoo clocks were probably not the decisive factor either . Before the July 2000 election, South Africa had been ahead for a long time. But at the last minute, some voters, mostly from Asia, swung around. Charles Dempsey from New Zealand didn't even vote, although he wanted and should vote for South Africa. Germany won 12:11, in the event of a tie President Blatter would probably have decided in favor of South Africa. Dempsey took the secret of why he left the room just before the vote to his grave.

Shortly before, a Deutschland AG from politics and business had become active, especially in areas where members of the Fifa Executive Committee lived. Daimler invested hundreds of millions of euros in Hyundai, a son of the Hyundai founder sat on the Executive Committee of Fifa. Volkswagen and Bayer AG promised high investments in Thailand and South Korea. **A week before the World Cup was awarded, Gerhard Schr√∂der's government decided to supply rocket-propelled grenades to Saudi Arabia. Germany ""lifted the arms embargo at short notice,"" said Guido Tognoni, then a Fifa employee, later.** The late media entrepreneur Leo Kirch bought worthless TV rights to friendly matches from Bayern Munich for millions of marks. pelvis builderwas president of the association at the time. A Kirchs company transferred a large sum to Thai Fifa member Morawi Makudi . Makudi chose Germany. When he was asked about it at a press conference for the 2011 Women's World Cup in Berlin, Blatter himself broke off the event.

Legally, Germany's action may have been legal, but it was not exactly in the spirit of sportsmanship. All this has been known for more than ten years. The German public prefers to remember the summer fairy tale. Corruption is seen as a problem for others, for example Trinidad or Vanuatu.

And they did that solely out of familiarity, because Qatar already had a large fleet of Mirage 2000s they wanted to replace, which themselves were a replacement for Mirage F1s in 1994.

>Rey also instructed the gang to target Platini, the famous former footballer, on 10 May 2019. Platini had been one of the Fifa executive committee members that had backed Qatar‚Äôs winning bid to host this year‚Äôs World Cup. There had been rumours that he had been pressured to do so during a lunch meeting with the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy and Qatar‚Äôs ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who was then a prince, a few days before he voted.

An equivalent 'spin would be ""100,000 dead as COVID rampages through UK"" to be clarified that only say, 0.1 per cent of those deaths were actually from Covid.""

i4qq5zx,t3_u3jshl,"Probably going to get downvoted for this, but they're an islamic country where, to them, anything non-hetero is practically sinning and spitting in the face of their religion and gods they're highly devoted to. To them, if it's promoted within their nation by their guests, they're practically shitting on those aforementioned gods.

I'm an atheist, and obviously I think that this is unreasonable on surface level and as far as realistic logic goes. But you're a guest, visiting an entire nation who just doesn't want to spit on and go against their gods, that they're devoted to. What's the point of promoting something that actively spits on their beliefs?

Here's a more black and white view. Is spitting on some rock super bad? No. But why would you want to go to India just to spit on Shiva's sculpture in a temple? Ofc you'd be tackled and arrested for that.

Now, this is less black and white, but still. You're going to watch a game. Why would you want to do stuff in their nation that they consider a spit in the face of their gods? To them, they invited you as guests, and you're committing sins that are causing due to this world event they held. They're not banning people, but they don't want any active promotion of stuff.

If it helps understand better, imagine if incest was not only frowned upon in western culture, but also a grave religious sin. Now imagine someone you invited coming over to promote incest.

What's the point anyway lol. Is homophobia backwards thinking? Sure. But no need to visit  an islamic nation during World Cup just to combat it against people who are bound by religion and definitely won't change due to some flags.",Shanal183,,8,8,2022-04-14 19:49:41

At the time, the ruling dictatorship had to deal (1) with massive poverty exacerbated under their rule and (b) the growing world attention to their very bad Human Rights violations, with 30,000 to 60,000 disappeared people during their murderous regime. 

So, they plastered the road from the Ezeiza airport to Buenos Aires downtown (which used to be covered with shanty towns - ‚Äúvillas miseria‚Äù) with big advertising signs, which played on variations of ‚Äúlos Argentines somos *derechos y humanos*‚Äù; the signs were a way of trivializing the Spanish phrase for Human Rights (which translates to *Derechos Humanos*) into a catchy advertising slogan, which translated back to English reads ‚ÄúWe Argentines are *straight and human*). Further, they hull-dozed the shanty towns while people were living in them‚Ä¶

The saddest part of this story is that, after massacres that took at least 30,000 people and made them disappear without process or accountability (Possibly as many as another 30,000 unverified), many Argentines today deny the events that took place (and even invent a ‚Äúdirty war‚Äù in which the disappeared were killed in a **war** with only a handful of victims on the other side).

So really it seems like the company visited, despite the very well documented human rights abuses, with a view to supplying their product, then realised that because of the conditions the grass would deteriorate quickly to being a terrible playing surface and decided they didn't want to be associated with a product that would quickly appear, to a global audience, to be inferior.

Most of you are just jumping the bandwagon of hate, I‚Äôm not saying Qatar doesn‚Äôt deserve it.

Why‚Äôs that? I don‚Äôt get it?

Please, if you‚Äôre gonna hate, at least be fair. Don‚Äôt judge one but not the other. 

I‚Äôve also seen people insulting Qatari citizens, what the hell do they have to do with this? Talking about ""I don‚Äôt see them building the stadiums"", seriously? What difference would that make? Good on them that they‚Äôre rich. There‚Äôs only 300,000 Qatari citizens and the country only gained independence in 1971. A minimum wage was introduced recently and works have been put into improving the living conditions, also they‚Äôre free to leave whenever with a free ticket guaranteed back to their country. If you actually did a bit of research you‚Äôd see, but of course, the media just wants the juicy stuff. 

China, USA, Russia, these countries are committing mass war crimes, but no attention is paid. People would speak, but not act. Not because they can‚Äôt, but because it affects them. 

I feel like Qatar is used as a scapegoat, they can‚Äôt do anything about those countries so they jump on Qatar and absolutely make sure it‚Äôs well and known about their violation of human rights and demand effort. But when Qatar makes effort, bandwagon still continues, whilst turning a blind eye to the other countries. 

To make it short, Qatar is still a progressing country. You have a right to criticize a country for violating human rights. If people exercised this right equally and fairly, then you‚Äôd see a genuine criticism against most, if not all countries.

Qatar is a new country that in no way can be compared with western countries. It is growing up, and everything, including learning and human rights is adapting in an accelerated way. But it will take at least one or two more generations before there is distance comparison with the western world. Mindset is the biggest challenge, and that takes time to change.

When looking at the Netherlands, we also have a history of treating safety and people poorly, and we grew out of it over hundreds of years. Is it realistic that Qatar from a desert culture to country in 40 years can do the same?

ix54ymp,t3_z0an3d,"Match #1
Quatar Vs. Equador

The Group Stages got underway today with a party atmosphere in Al Khor. But not even the sparkling new Al Bayt facility could make up for the disapointing result for Qatar. 

Someone forgot to tell the Ecuadorians that Qatar are defending Asia Cup winners. Or maybe they don‚Äôt care. Equador defeated Qatar 2:0, becoming the first football team to show up and beat the host team on their opening match. 

The match was over in the first fifteen minutes. The first half saw 3 Ecuadorian goals; one was disalowed. Meanwhile, the Qatari side could not attempt a shot on goal. By half time their fans headed to the outdoor activities outside the arena, and then for a sombre ride home. (Now would be a good time to think about spending billions of dollars constructioning cages to get your ass kicked in.) 
The second half was played to empty seats and beerless Latinos. 

Who could blame them for getting a little rowdy? It looks like Qatar is on their way to becoming the new South Africa, because after this awful performance they are already out of the world cup for pratical reasons. (They have a match against world number eight Netherlands next week, which they will lose.) And what about the Equadorians?

crt102w,t3_387eq7,"This has gone way too far, now they are accusing people who don't support their World Cup as being racist? WOW! Let me tell you a little bit about Qatar. 


Qatar should never have been given the right to host the World Cup in the first place. Their footballing history is nil and thus their contribution to the sport is nil. Players cannot operate in the extreme heat, and the necessary measures to alter the conditions, so that they are suitable for players and fans, would have a huge and negative impact on the environment.

Then you can take a look at the country itself. Just a quick bit of reading leaves me under no illusion that they are desperate to spend their newly acquired oil wealth to make a name for themselves globally. It is a society where women's voices and opinions are ignored and deemed less valuable than a mans. Where legislature induces forced labour upon its workers, fails to protect their rights and doesn't necessitate maintaining any sort of wage standards or health and safety for it's workforce.

As of 2005, certain provisions of the Qatari Criminal Code allowed punishments such as flogging and stoning to be imposed as criminal sanctions. Female tourists are not allowed to wear leggings, miniskirts, sleeveless dresses and short or tight clothing in public. It goes on.. The 'press' or media in Qatar has been internationally deemed as not free. Prohibitions include laws against criticising the ruling Emir.. And all this on top of the allegations of bribery and corruption.. 

So why would we choose to hold the WC here? Why wouldn't we choose to hold it somewhere not only more suitable, but equally more deserving that isn't tarnished by all of these discrepancies? None of us, the fans, Chose it. I'll tell you why FIFA did. It's because Qatar is the richest nation per capita in the world, and money talks louder than anything.

This comment will most likely be buried, like the rights of people under the enormous wealth of the few who control and dominate society. We need to boycott FIFA and the World Cup and stop this madness. I will have no part in it myself.

I suspect Qatari officials are in fact wrong, that the investigations are perfectly reasonable and that, considering the Russian hosted World Cup in 2018 (Russia being a white, European country) is ALSO being investigating, that their accusations of racism are well off the mark.

So run by me again who the first people to start making this about race were? Is it therefore fair to say that, by saying ""It's only because we're Arabs"" that conversely they are also saying ""It's only because the FIFA investigators are white""? So who are the racists again?

A lot of the projects(buildings and things) are just pushed through with money, considering that's the only way Qataris know how to fix any problem. The airports in that region (Dubai, UAE, Qatar, etc) are contracted by people involved in a big-penis contest, so they make them big enough to transit through enormous amounts of people, but absolutely nowhere near enough people will ever use that region as a transit hub, since Europeans going to Asia go over the polar region. Everything is built with to satisfy a bigger is better mentality. Dubai has a longer runway than us? Fuck it, make ours ten feet longer. They put a control tower in the airport on hold halfway through so they could see how high someone else made theirs, and then finished it ten feet taller. It's so fucking childish.

England showed a cohesion and guile I've honestly not seen before from us at a tournament. Smart decisions with the ball, finding pockets of space, elusive running at defenders. There was a trap, turn and pass from Mason Mount in the first half that some of our past players would have heart attacks imagining. 

There are much bigger tests ahead, but after 2010 I said I would be happy with any team that didn't just play like total shit. We conceded two, not ideal, but it is so refreshing that after a lifetime of watching leaden footed cloggers who can't break opponents down in the middle third, we now have generation who can string moves together and connect and flow like a legitimate football team.",STICKY-WHIFFY-HUMID,,14,14,2022-11-21 15:54:34

- Spain - 4pts, +7 GD  
- Japan - 3pts, 0 GD 
- Costa Rica - 3pts, -6 GD  
- Germany - 1pt, -1 GD

If Spain beat Japan: Germany need to beat Costa Rica to qualify on points. That would make it:

- Spain - 7pts, +8 GD or more
- Germany - 4pts, 0 GD or more
- Japan - 3pts, -1 GD or less
- Costa Rica - 3pts, -7 GD or less

Not a tough ask for both European teams, but they must be careful.

If Spain draw against Japan: Same as above but Germany need to win by 2:

- Spain - 5pts, +7 GD
- Germany - 4pts, 1 GD or more
- Japan - 4pts, 0 GD
- Costa Rica - 3pts, -8 GD or less

Again not too hard, but if Japan can hold Spain to a stalemate, Germany will have to do more to capitalize.

If Japan beat Spain: Germany need to beat Costa Rica by a large enough margin:

Worst case scenario, Japan win by 1, Germany win by 8:
- Japan - 6pts, +1 GD
- Germany - 4pts, +7 GD
- Spain - 4pts, +6 GD
- Costa Rica - 3pts, -14 GD

If Japan win by 2, Germany need to do a Spain and win by 7:
- Japan - 6pts, +2 GD

**The good**

The added time is finally accurate, this is absolutely massive and respect to the referees for fixing this 

The temperature in the stadium actually seems perfect conditions with the aircon/winter period. (joke it had to be moved, though).

**The bad**

VAR is quite clearly ridiculous. They are way too trigger happy to jump in and yet didn't for then most egregious case of corner grappling on Maguire. So even in the same game we've seen massive levels of inconsistency.

Refereeing standards - A Qatari referee should never be a thing (Wales vs USA). This guy clearly didn't have the experience for the occasion.

FIFA has been an absolute joke to the point it really needs active reform. From the last minute U-turn on beer to the lack of transparency on what would happen with armbands.

Qatari's have not been welcoming to LGBTQ - people not being let into stadiums for a rainbow hat or t shirt is ridiculous and embarassing.

Overall? Bit of a stinker as we all anticipated and we have to hope the football itself makes it better. It's quite clear Qatar should never have been given this world cup and here it is coming to fruition.",,,10,10,2022-11-22 10:21:09

We were so clumsy on the ball in the first 2 games without Allen, but even with him in the side he just doesn't have the legs anymore, not that he did when he was younger but even more so now. Goes for a lot of our team too, just feels like one tournament too far with this crop.

The problem now is our next crop is nowhere near on the same level, and as fantastic as the last 10 years have been, we might be waiting a very long time to see something like this again.

One thing to note is that the team [hired a few Spanish coaches](http://mengnews.joins.com/view.aspx?aid=3046842) as part of the staff, including assistant coach Toni Grande, who was Vicente del Bosque's assistant during that manager's time at Real and Spain.

Since our defense is crap, our best chances of progressing into the knockout rounds is to attack and somehow score more than Germany, Mexico, and Sweden do in our matches. Which will be hard to do since we've been hit with so many injuries (attackers Kwon Chang-hoon, Yeom Ki-hun, and Lee Keun-ho are out, as is defender Kim Min-jae - Kim Jin-su is also a doubt).

Most fellow Korea fans I've spoken to aren't optimistic about our chances in this World Cup, and I agree.

Koreans know this and have been trying to implement a more Spanish approach (*a la Tiki-Taka*) but results have failed.

The fact that Korea‚Äôs first match is against Sweden is worrisome. If both countries employ tough aggressive football, the Swedes will undoubtedly dominate. And that is the reason that the injury of Kwon Chang-Hoon, a Dijon winger with 11 goals this season that Koreans hoped would provide a spark of creativity missing in its national team, comes as a fatal blow to our chances.

e0budz4,t3_8nik3e,"Really informative write\-up, good job to the two authors.

I'm just going to address the tactical part really quickly, as I didn't see anybody here addressing it properly.

The reason our manager is so insistent on preparing a 3\-man back in a 3\-4\-1\-2 is because our first opponent, Sweden, is nearly certain to come out in the 4\-4\-2 they've been playing for awhile. Tactically, the best way to neutralize a 2\-man strike force is to deploy a 3\-man or a 5\-man backline. The simple theory is that a 3\-man back should theoretically have a 1\-man advantage on a 2\-man strike force.

That's why our manager is insisting on a 3\-4\-1\-2, it's because the 3\-man back is considered a stronger system to counter a 4\-4\-2, compared to using a 4\-man back with only 2 CBs. 

In contrast, Germany generally uses a 4\-2\-3\-1, and Mexico usually a 4\-3\-3 or a 4\-2\-3\-1, although sometimes a 4\-4\-2 as well. For these teams that use a 1\-man strike force primarily, a 4\-man back with 2 CBs is considered the best way to neutralize them. 

Therefore, you will likely see Korea play a 4\-4\-2 against Mexico and Germany.

If you enjoyed the simple tactical analysis above, come check out a blog on the Korea national team that I contribute to, called the Tavern of the Taegeuk Warriors. The website's at [TaegukWarriors.com](https://TaegukWarriors.com), and we're also active on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. I can also be found on r/KLeague, and sometimes on BigSoccer Korea.

e0nna33,t3_8nik3e,"The 4-4-2 formation looks really off. Why would Jang Hyun Soo play at RB and not CB? It will be Lee Yong who will play there. Also there is no way Lee Jae Sung and Ki get paired together in center midfield. Lee Jae Sung will most likely get shifted to one of the wings while Jung Woo Young likely comes inside to pair up with Ki in center midfield. 

Also, it's not like we turned down ≈ûenol G√ºne≈ü out of choice or incompetence. First, our budget is so that we can only offer managers a maximum of $1 million per year. It's highly likely ≈ûenol G√ºne≈ü' demands were higher. Add that to the fact that with little less than a year left until the world cup appointing a foreign manager would not really have been ideal since getting to know the team and getting comfortable with the system alone would have taken a long time.

Even the footage available on YT supports such a notion.

With FIFA archive having many WC full matches available, you can watch the match yourself [here](https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/watch/3GaGfG22DIWzDwCtaz2DkN).

I've watched some random minutes throughout whole match and to me it seems like they were playing standard football with training boots on. Only the last 10-20 minutes truly seemed like what is usually described in articles and books about this match. Which is actually understandable because, as was already stated, the result was beneficial for both sides and an error in dying minutes of the match would have been fatal. Honestly, some matches of current WC were almost as boring as the one we are talking about here.

Allegations of match-fixing seem like some salty football fans disliked the result. Something that often happened before and after.

i7feq9m,t3_uivv0g,"**IV) Carlo Ancelotti is one of the GOATs**   
It grinds my gears when people go with the narrative that Don Carlo is just a good man manager, like that's the only reason he has won the Top 5 leagues (only manager to ever do that), won 3 Cups in Italy, England, and Spain, and reached 5 UCL finals winning 3 (or 4, we'll see).   
  
Tactically, Don Carlo started out as a traditional 442 manager with Parma but later switched to 3412 at Juventus to accommodate Zidane in the n.10 role. Then at Milan he switched again to 4321 (known as the Christmas Tree) and transferred attacking midfielder Pirlo to the world best deep lying playmaker and had Inzaghi as the lone striker.   
   
When he moved to Chelsea he played a 442 Diamond with Lampard and Ballack as box to box mids. Then at Real he yet again switched to 433 to have CR7 at his best position as a left inside forward.   
   
This fluidity and adaptability was crucial in his success as a manager by allowing players to thrive in their favourite positions playing with freedom to showcase their abilities. This instilled trust in them and made them produce their best output under his management. His teams were defensively organised and rigid but offensively direct and dynamic.    
   
Carlo Ancelotti is the pioneer of the category of managers that don't have a robotic system that they impose on their players, but rather those who customize tailor-made systems that incorporates players in their best positions having the freedom to express themselves on the pitch. That's why he's certainly one of the greatest football managers of all time.",PharaohLeo,,44,44,2022-05-05 14:11:47

 My football explanation is this. Teams like city and barca who play ""tiki taka"" could never make an overturn like this. ""Tiki taka"" in his perfect form can provide you a total football and can destroy even the best teams. But if something goes wrong, you re done. 
Players who serve this style of football, are like robots who do everything mechanical, without plan b when the circumstances demands it. 
To be honest, to overturn a match like this, you need a crossing, you need a header, you need nerves. Something that Real Madrid has completely, and city has not, even in the minimum.

i7fivfe,t3_uivv0g,"I don't even know how to encapsulate just how miraculous this Real Madrid run has been.

Real Madrid were 17-1 to win the UCL at some bookies prior to their first game against PSG.

PSG were favoured against Real Madrid, were up 2 goals, and then within a 15 minute period, were dead and buried by a Benzema hat trick.

Reigning UCL champions Chelsea were favoured against Real Madrid, had fought their way into a winning position after being stunned at home in the first leg, but they would succumb to a late Rodrygo goal created out of nothing and fall to a Benzema header in extra time.

Reigning English Champions City were also favoured against Real Madrid, they battered them in the first leg at the Ethihad yet still only had a 1 goal advantage to show for it. After increasing their advantage to 2 goals on aggregate in the second half and coming close to a third, you could see them thinking already about Paris, even some of Real Madrid's home fans had left, hopeless -- and yet, City too would falter, stunned by one Rodrygo goal in the 90th minute, then stupefied by another within 70 seconds. By extra time Madrid's victory felt assured, Benzema inevitable, when he was taken down in the area and the ref pointed to the spot it was manifest destiny.

&#x200B;

Telling in so many of these games to me, was, for lack of a better term or words, 'championship pedigree', the degree to which Real Madrid had 'it' and the other teams lacked 'it'.

When these bested teams had their advantage, you could see-- you could feel them just playing out the clock, desperate for the game to be over.

I feel like this quality is what allowed Real Madrid to creep back into these ties, they smell blood in the water, they can tell when a team has mentally switched off just that little bit, and when they do unexpectedly strike back it is transparent how crestfallen the opponents have seemed once Real Madrid assert themselves, like they've accepted their defeat as being part of their destiny, as much as Madrid saw being the unlikely victors as a part of theirs.

&#x200B;

In the aftermath of this completely epic run, it's been really interesting and sort of hilarious seeing how some of the pundits have framed these defeats after the fact. Certain ones I've listened to have seemed to just completely dismissed or undersold Real Madrid's unique qualities in these comeback wins.

Hearing them tell it, it was all about the defeated teams' mistakes, how they set up wrong, how unlucky they were, that 'the better team lost'.

I know they're biased, but still bears mention, I saw a clip yesterday of Carragher boldly stating, with no doubt whatsoever, that City were the better team -- despite the fact that they had just played 2 games and came up short! Despite Madrid defeating a gauntlet of challenging competition en route to the final, and proving themselves more battle-tested than City.

So many of these post-mortem comments attribute the favourites' drawbacks to bad luck, like it could have happened against anybody, ignoring how much these teams have been outplayed, albeit in small but utterly lethal doses in certain cases, because it goes against the pre-conceived narrative they've constructed and doubled-down on.

It is beyond good fortune, this is a team that knows how to walk an opponent down, that has a brutally efficient, clinical quality to them.

Not only that -- but Real Madrid are already reigning La Liga champions with 4 weeks to spare, they had just beaten the team who bested City in last year's final, and before that beaten the semi-final team City had to make the final the same season.

Part of becoming a UCL power-house is knowing how to kill off a game, to put an opponent down and out.

Yesterday's Madrid win was not an isolated incident, Real Madrid have done this 3 times this campaign, multiple times in the past.

Consequent to the group-stage, Real Madrid arguably (and unluckily) had the toughest seeding route to the final, and yet, crazy as it is to believe, Real Madrid have qualified for 10 of the last 12 UCL Semi Finals, their 5th final in less than a decade, this team transcends luck.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Originally had a line saying how City barely protested the PK, looked to me like they were going through motions of it, but they did contest it as everyone does I suppose so changed it to manifest destiny line.",,,28,28,2022-05-05 14:40:17

I had something similar but not exactly when my friend and her baby died in a car accident. Her mom was so upset that she forgot to tell us on the phone that my friend died also, so when we rushed to the hospital, we thought that it would be to be there for my friend and be there with her while the team was trying to save the babies but actually she had died first. We found out when we got to the hospital and the doctor had the news that the baby wasn't going to make it ""either"" and I said, ""either? Who else...?"" And then everyone realized that we didn't know. My mom wailed in shock but I just shut down completely from the shock and horror. I was the person she was meeting that night, the reason she had gotten her kids together into the car and gone out in the first place. 

Sorry didn't mean to trauma dump all over your post, but I felt it was a little similar because of the not knowing what everyone else knows and then suddenly getting faced with that shock.

m2mqbaq,t3_1hgjx83,"this is so wrong. Yesterday an independent research group in London released a report on what the real numbers versus what‚Äôs been reported by both sides really are. The net results are Hama says 40k have been killed. As much as 50% women and children. However they estimate that about 15000 combatants were reported as civilians, finding many deaths happened before the water or mis categorized. They also say in a years time about 5,000 die annually when not at war. So the report estimates 40K-5k natural deaths-15k combatants=20k civilians have been killed in Gaza. My take is even if the top number is 45k that still means noon combatant deaths would be 25k a far cry from over 40k. Every death is a tragedy, but as wars go these numbers are actually the lowest as a percentage of any war since WWII.       I really hope Norway Spain and others wake up.

Morocco win: 1st African Team to win it. Dogged and determined team.

Brazil wanted to win for Pel√© on his deathbed, for all the veterans who will play their last WC, for the coach, for the staff, for everyone's children, for Neymar because people want to push him to the hall of fame with Pel√©, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho & Co., for all the 200 Mio Brazilians who treat the sport like a religion, probably also for Jesus.

They always put too much burden on themselves, being too emotional can work like an obstacle that holds you back.

Has been like that in every recent WC... I still deeply remember the semi finals 2014 against Germany, when the Brazilians walked in the arena holding each other shoulders, it didn't look like a sign of strength, more like prisoners walking into a prison. You could feel how much weight lay on their shoulders, I immediately thought ""they will lose this game"" and so it happened.

Can we? Yes.

We're as good as any XI in the tournament and oh boy have we got depth.

j0uycx6,t3_zpq218,"I‚Äôve been a fan of Mario since 2011 when he broke into the starting lineup at BVB and cemented his spot as the best academy player ever. He could do things in the Fubonaut that no other player could. He was the future of the club.

With Dortmund replacing the outgoing Kagawa with Reus changed that squad dynamic so much that that has never been repeated. Going anywhere close to the CL final hasn‚Äôt been repeated either.

I hate our club mgmt but they didn‚Äôt have a choice when Mario forced them to put a low release clause that Bayern happily triggered that winter in 2013 which broke all of our collective hearts and led Hummels to not sleep for a couple of nights.

That backstabbing SoB made around 8M at Bayern and our mgmt could have offered him that much given that he was going to be the face of our club. But he went around saying he wanted to play for Pep. And we all know how that turned out. 

Despite that, I kept wishing he‚Äôd return and join forces with Reus again. They did but G√∂tze was no longer the same player. Not even close. He did maintain his ego though and refused to take a paycut even though he was the highest paid player in the squad. That‚Äôs twice that he‚Äôd been thankless to the club and fans who supported him throughout his career.

That WC goal was a tough pill to swallow all around and didn‚Äôt help that it was him who scored. A Bayern player not a Dortmund one. Argentina losing to Germany again‚Ä¶.a repeat of 1990 when Jurgen Klinsmann dove like an Olympic gold medal winning champion to screw over Diego and co.

As a country, India needs to get better about appreciating sport in general. The crowd for the final was atrocious. It didn't feel like cricket fans in attendance - just India fanatics who couldn't appreciate another team playing well.

Also, you can make a really strong case at this point that Australia is the better ODI team anyway and that the final was no fluke. They came to India and won the ODI series earlier this year (and we even had Hardik Pandya available for that series). And then followed it up and split the two games with us at the World Cup, winning the one that actually mattered. Over 5 matches **in India** in 2023, Australia prevailed 3-2.

kavmv9e,t3_184a9ru,"I am getting  amused by so much cry about  stadium environment and rather find It funny.I know it's more because of politics imo..

I would  recommend people to rewatch 2011 finals, the wankhede got totally silent  when Sachin got out and SL were exited as fuck..Virat was a youngster  then but he stitched  a important  partnership  with Gambir, during  the course of thier partnership  crowd did found  their voice but were silenced when Dilshan took the wicket of Kohli..You can watch it in highlights..Then Dhoni came and to his credit,  he started  positively , hit some boundaries..on the  other side  Gambir  was doing thing efficiently. With their partnership flourishing , a India win was becoming  more and more certain. This is when  Wankede became lively  and crowd found  thier voice   and atmosphere became electric..If we had in a position  to lose that match one sided like 2023 finals  , the wankede  crowd too would have gotten silent..

Fast forward  to 2023  the fans were totally  behind the home team when Aussiee were 47/3 and when  Head was struggling..But once the partnership  between him and Marnus ,it was becoming certain  that India  is gonna lose that too  one-sided. This is when the stadium crowd became silent and I can bet my life this would  have happened  In most the Indian grounds...infact even  the people watching cricket in a projector at my area became silent during  that partnership..Kids did got a little excited when review was taken against  labuchange but were disappointed quick.. 

I mean Indians  are emotionally attached to Cricket, we have seen the same with  BD fans as well...SO we  can just say anything what serves out thinking abyways..",Attacktitan92,,2,2,2023-11-26 20:12:33

On part of the crowd, people targeting ahmedabad crowd and bigging up Wankhede or Eden. Those are the same places where Sachin was booed and stones were thrown and effigies were burnt.

People don't seem to understand that the local crowd in Ahmedabad was not there to watch the match. Every single hotel in Ahmedabad was booked for cricket. The people who showed up were ardent fans who could afford those tickets. Not your usual fans who are rabid in their support. Sure India needed those fans, but blaming the crowd is just a brainded analysis.

lb5d3w6,t3_1dsuhey,"This World Cup was absolute banger and I enjoyed the Caribbean flavour which really added the glamour needed for this World Cup. Incredibly good to see fairytale story of Afghanistan's chapter which was glorified in this World Cup with a sensational run to semifinals including a stunning win over Australia before a bittersweet ending. All importantly South Africa finally breaking the shackles to reach a UCC World Cup final for the first time by winning tight games one after the other before a gut wrenching defeat in final 

India ending their long awaited ICC tournament dream with a resilient comeback powered by Kohli's masterclass for one last time in ultimately his farewell T20I and Rohit signing off with a T20 WC as captain in his final T20I. Suryakumar Yadav making it a memorable by pulling off a breathtaking jaw-dropping catch under pressure. 

United States made a huge statement with a shocking win over Pakistan in super over and it probably raised lot of talk about America prospering in cricket and people started to follow US cricket especially started to gain interest among native Americans little by little. 

Nepal made rapid strides and making a comeback to ICC senior tournament after a decade and the reception of Nepali fanbase added different vibes to this World Cup. Not to forget Sompal Kami's iconic cult classic 105m six off the bowling of Anrich Nortje which is one of the moments of the World Cup for me. That 6 really gave Nepal a thundering comeback against South Africa which looked like South Africa's game before a heartbreaking defeat. 

Not to forget the remarkable victory of Afghanistan over Bangladesh in what looked like rain was trying to play spoilsport in a must win match for either sides and D/L 
calculation changed very often in the heat of the contest and Bangladesh were put in a precarious situation whether to go all guns blazing or play it safe to chase low but tricky target but inside 12.1 overs to make it to semifinals. All of sudden looked like Afghanistan was going to choke to gift Australia a lifeline but Afghanistan made a fightback for the ages with a disciplined bowling although their batting was questionable throughout the match.",Kathanayagan-3821,,26,26,2024-07-01 16:35:39

2. While the early morning start wasn't ideal, it did help maintain consistent pitch conditions for both teams. On the other hand, in evening matches, the toss becomes critical, especially due to the dew factor.",Nitsy_,,27,27,2024-07-01 16:54:11

* The 20 team format is much better
* The USA cricket team basically single-handedly thwarted the ICC's attempts to permanently kill the sport in the country. Scotland also performed well above expectations. As did Canada, who flew under the radar due to the loss to USA, but they were the only team to post a decent total in New York
* Dallas. Great venue for cricket.
* A good reminder that cricket doesn't have to be dominated by the bat.

Bad:

* Scheduling. All aspects. the 10AM starts. Dragging the first group stage out a week too long, due to a refusal to schedule matches between the morning and evening ones.
* (some) Pitches. The New York one was bad enough, but the SA vs AFG semi-final pitch seemed to be a deliberate choice.
* Coverage. The tournament was set up for the worst narratives, and the cricket media duly provided it. From cricinfo constantly regurgitating /r/cricket conspiracy fodder about certain teams. To The Guardian's ""Here we are in Dallas, sure is a terrible event here... (USA vs Canada is incredible)... *cough ahem* I MEAN HERE WE ARE IN NEW YORK WHAT A CLUSTERFUCK AMIRITE!?""
* Some teams' performances. Both Full member (NZ, Ireland, Sri Lanka) and Associate (Namibia, Uganda, PNG). PNG particularly because they were so good vs West Indies, then showed nothing for the rest of the tournament.
* The ICC
* There's an alternate universe where there are two well planned world cups in a row, one in USA, one in the Caribbean

Then keeping matches in Florida in peak hurricane season in a ground that had no drainage....we lost games when the sun was beating down because of outfield...that is not on.

> What was (and can still be) an organic, truly egalitarian sport with deep roots in working class communities everywhere now appears to be little more than a plaything for the richest of the rich

Plenty of people prefer to watch top teams in the world over their local clubs. This creates non-egalitarian situation in football, not evil ""rich people"" trying to force rest to do it.

Egalitarian, organic, ""working class"" football still exists, if you will watch your local, amateur 5th tier league competitions, you will find it. If people from whole world want to watch professional, elite football, it will be organically captured by people understanding value of this demand, it will be commodified to became tolerable enough to people with very different backgrounds and some other things happen that wouldn't be liked for person expecting world class football to be tailor-made for them. For people giving actual fuck (I am not talk about virtual signallers but real activists) it's sad state of affair but they're naive if they think issue is about few guys on top and not on human beings in general.

ith4lfu,t3_ybe13z,"> The potential XI is fairly settled - Southgate is reluctant to deviate from his trusted lieutenants.

This is often said on /r/soccer but I don't think it's particularly true. Southgate's been perfectly willing to give players a chance in 'easier' games and reward them if they do well. Saka went from being barely making the squad at the start of the Euros, putting in an impressive shift in a dead rubber against the Czechs, and because of that ended up being a key player in the knockouts.

I wouldn't be surprised if someone like Chilwell, or even JWP, put in a solid performance in a group stage game and found their way into the starting XI later on.",SouthWalesImp,,6,6,2022-10-23 16:44:31

80% of Qatar's export revenue comes from Asia so even if North America and Europe entirely stop doing business with Qatar, they will still do fine. 

Same thing with Saudi Arabia, 80% of their export revenue comes from Asia and Africa and both of those continents do not care about Western views and values.

They've also been investing heavily in many regions including Europe and North America and in various industries so they have been diversifying their economy to rely less on revenue from their top exports. 

People think all these anti-Qatar articles will hurt Qatar's image, sure maybe to the average Joe in western countries but certainly not to their trade partners and not in non-western countries either. Qatar and Saudi Arabia will be fine. People need to wake up and understand how the real world works outside of Reddit, Twitter, and Western mainstream media.

Herdman is adventurous and can surprise with formations. He was the first manager to play Davies as a fullback before he went to Bayern and also deployed him as a 10 during qualifiers. 

This is David's moment. With noise around his next move to a bigger club (possibly in January) he will have that extra motivation. Concerning that Larin has not been playing much at Brugge but Herdman leans on him and will rotate him up front with Ugbo. If Cavallini sees a minute of playing time I will take this as a sign we are fucked.

Eustaquio's in good form and playing with a lot of growing confidence all year. Think he can turn some heads if we advance.

Finally, I added this after reading some of the comments: Arfield absolutely should not get called up. I get that Canada doesn‚Äôt have the quantity of quality midfielders. But the reason why Canada plays well is because we jive well as a unit. We mainly use the same group of players, so there‚Äôs a bond that translates to being a good team.

Managers are praised for any success at all, but sustaining it is so so hard. Whatever motivational tactics you used the first time can not be repeated with the same success. Can you recreate yourself and/or the team again and again? Probably not. But outside there are many teams that are just hungrier and fresher then you can be.

At this point trying out Dembele as a 10 may not be a terrible idea because at least he can feed Benzema and Mbappe. Coman has been good at RWB for us but he's injury prone, I feel like Clauss can either make or break the team.

Biggest issue is the defense. Kimpembe has a fuck up him, Varane fell off since 2018, Upamecano is hot trash everytime he plays for France, Lucas is injured, and Deschamps don't trust Konate / Mukiele.",,,19,19,2022-11-07 15:36:14

The only issue is he and Benzema don't seem to play well together. Sometimes sharing the same space 

I remember in some of the Nations League games, Mbappe would have the ball on the left but there was no one in the middle to link up with or cross to, because both Benz and Antoine drop too deep. Nkunku looked bright when he played.

Midfield took a hard downgrade compared to 2018. No Pogba means France aren't contenders anymore imo. He's far too important. No one else there has his absurd passing range among his other qualities.

Defence is solid except for right side. For some reason Kounde and Upamecano do not look good for France. No Maignan is a miss. Hopefully Lloris is still soild 4 years later.",KryptonianCode,,4,4,2022-11-07 19:39:47
ivgltbi,t3_yopg68,"I am French and I watch all our games. This is my opinion:

I don‚Äôt think we are favorites tbh as much as people think we are. We lost Kante and Pogba who are our best two midfielders by far and made Deschamps system tick like clockwork. Do we have talented plays to replace them like Camavinga and Tchouameni? Sure but they haven‚Äôt exactly performed at their level so far and not just them. We been playing a 3 at the back system so far and we been struggling tbh. Our defense is the main concern. It looks so vulnerable. And we have so many players that don‚Äôt perform for the national team right now like Kound√©, Upamecano. Saliba hasn‚Äôt been at his best like he is with Arsenal. Konate is injured but I would have loved to have him as his partner. Badashile has been solid so far on his debut game so I‚Äôm excited for him. Midfield has no creativity without Guendouzi in it tbh. Hence why we miss Pogba the most. Griezmann is a shadow of his former self so far and Nkunku has performed better but still not quite up to par yet. Hopefully Benzema gets healthy before the World Cup. Also with playing this 3 at the back system we would need Theo Hernandez but for now we have Coman or Rabiot playing there who are alright but not been amazing.

Overall I think we will get out of groups probably but I don‚Äôt think we will have a deep run this time and will struggle unfortunately. Mbapp√© is great but tries too much to do on his own. When he plays with his teammates he can be unstoppable.",ThatFrenchCray,,6,6,2022-11-07 20:41:25

Also Netherlands, one of the likely candidates, should be safe thanks to Man√©'s injury.

Well I mean this was literally never possible since they changed the way the pots were organised and groups are drawn in 2018. Unless you're referring to ELO ranking


The pots were ordered in terms of FIFA World Ranking (aside from the host who are put into pot 1), , so in every group there's gonna be just two teams, no more and no less, that are in the top 16 of the qualified teams.


Prior to 2018, the pots weren't decided by FIFA ranking outside of Pot 1 but I think something like geographic separation. It was less organised",,,5,5,2022-11-19 16:27:51

Torino also agreed with Wolfsburg ‚Ç¨10m fee to permanently sign him but he suddenly stopped the negotiation probably thinking he was good enough to play for a better team. Consequences:

- No important team tried to sign him in the summer

- Benchwarming at Wolfsburg.

- Not called for the WC 2022.

The deepest squad we ever had, wealth of player and tactical options on a level we never had. Both the 2018 and 1998 squads were paper thin with huge dropoffs between the first XI and the subs.

Juranoviƒá-≈†utalo-Gvardiol-Sosa is a lineup people may not be familiar with now, but it‚Äôs almost guranteed they all play for bigger clubs in about a year. That‚Äôs why Lovren (who index.hr predict to start üíÄ) should be nowhere near the field.

Petko is in great form, best since 2019, I could see him start ahead of the other guys. 

For fantasy/betting players, if Pa≈°aliƒá is likely to start, he is a great goalscorer pick. He is actually the player with the most goals for the NT in the last two years, and he always finds himself at the right place at the right time.

Concerning the possible squad:

Livakoviƒá, Gvardiol, Sosa, Juranoviƒá, Brozoviƒá, Modriƒá, Kovaƒçiƒá, Peri≈°iƒá are definite locks. I just hope Gvardiol is 100% ready for the first game (concerning his recent injury). 

The second CB is up for debate and honestly it's a 50/50 tossup between ≈†utalo and Erliƒá. I'm definitely leaning a bit more on the Erliƒá side even though I believe ≈†utalo is the better player. ≈†utalo made some crucial mistakes in the last Nations League cycle (Eriksen banger) and CL cycle with Dinamo. Erliƒá just feels more confident to me. 

In our attack only one thing is actually for sure: Peri≈°iƒá has to play. He's our joker, our tournament player and our main offensive outlet. This of course means that we will play the usual 4-1-4-1 formation with Modriƒá-Kovaƒçiƒá in the centre, two wings (Peri≈°iƒá on the left) and a number 9 up front. 

In this mentioned formation we need to fill the striker and right wing positions. For the striker, knowing Daliƒá, it's probably going to be Budimir (unfortunately). I agree with you in how I'd much prefer Livaja in the position. Petkoviƒá is not a number 9 and he best works as a false 9 (or theoretically a number 10/SS with Livaja up front, which would be a dream-come-true for us HNL fans). For the RW, there are several options. Either it's Pa≈°aliƒá (more offensive approach), Majer (more defensive/playmaker approach) or even Peri≈°iƒá (he can play right and in that case Or≈°iƒá plays left. This means a bit less offensive output on the left but more on the right, makes it more balanced).

Also Livaja is gonna piss off a lot of CBs. Since he isn't tall he legit bullies them. Watch the game between Croatia and Austria Alaba was fuming that legit 2 people started to man marked him that led to a third goal. He was pushing him giving him absolute zero respect in every challenge.

Budimir was decent for Osasuna last season but now he‚Äôs not at any kind of good form, especially Kramariƒá, as he‚Äôs being more of a winger play than a striker these days. We are going to have a real problem with Kramariƒá, Budimir, and Livaja. Livaja seems more of the build up/assist guy type than a striker in my opinion. We really rely heavily on Peri≈°iƒç and Modriƒá to be the combination in our goal tally. I hope Daliƒá plays Pa≈°aliƒá and Or≈°iƒç.

I see that you're just repeating what the article you linked to is telling you, but I feel the need to make a PSA that if someone is having a seizure there is NO need to make sure they don't swallow their tongue, choke on their tongue, anything like that. *Don't stick your hands or other objects into the mouth of someone having a seizure*. Really the only reason you should touch them is to remove them from a dangerous situation, or if a medical professional or 911 operator tell you to. Best case scenario you don't do anything helpful, **worst case scenario you cause them to choke on whatever you put in their mouth and they die**. Your tongue is meant to be inside your mouth! You can't choke on it and your body isn't able to swallow it unless you have some sort of extremely abnormal physiology.

Indeed the stakes of the world cup were huge for France, they had an incredible team, Zidane was blooming into a star player (won the ballon d'or this year) and the expectations and enthusiasm lf the French peiple were huge. 
But there have been many controversies surrounding this WC, and evidence of shady things can be found. Platini confessed 20 years later that they did some shenanigans to arrange the group stage draw so that France would only meet Brazil in the finale if they were both firstof their groups. Petit, who scored the 3rd goal of the finale, has also been suspicious of the whole tournament, and raised the possibility that shady arrangements took place behind the scenes. That is just on top of my head (and to be fair, the world of football is sadly ridden with these scandals), but a lot can be said about this tournament, which was very intense nonetheless.",Imtf_,,34,34,2023-01-12 17:27:48

j41msc2,t3_10a1qud,"i recently started watching some Raymar Football and other similar video channels documentaries and goddamn my passion in football has been rekindled after years of staying away from the game. excellent write up. this rekindled passion and watching through documentaries have given me newfound respect for names such as Ronaldo , Ronaldinho, Romario, Mourinho, Zinedine Zidane , Victor Vasquez, Angel Di Maria etc.

but honestly, one people on whom i wish i saw more write ups on, is Gabriel Batistuta. in the old days where i used to play FIFA in our PC , he was my star striker , and i couldnt find Messi in the squad. i was a fan of that guy and honestly, kinda forgot about him for a while.

now recently i saw a random post about Drax and Bautista the wrestler (whose name i remembered by the Wrestler/Cricket cards using which i used to play as a child) , a name which reminded me of Gabriel Batistuta the star striker of Argentina , and goddamn looking into who the guy was has given me massive amounts of respect for the man. watching this handsome man's tears of joy on argentina winning the world cup - i cant believe i ever forgot about this guy and his passion for football , and blame myself for this travesty.

j44dj3i,t3_10a1qud,"Sports (and uncles) tend to love this concept of a potential GOATs who got ""robbed"" of reaching their full potential because they messed up their knee or some other injury following a one-off event.

The fact is, both the rise to notoriety and the fall from the top spot are the results of some of these impactful moments, and it's kind of impossible to talk about hypothetically higher peaks that could have been reached. For every ""injury that changed everything for the worse"", there's a ""goal that changed everything for the better"". Picking and choosing a player's experience to only keep the best and imagine a theoretical peak is kind of pointless and is ultimately not doing the player any favors.

R9 had the best career he could have and it's a hell of a beautiful one. Like most, it's made of ups and downs, and certainly wouldn't be as admirable if it was just a boring line going up up up. Embrace the swinging nature of sports and honor the players' accomplishments instead of lamenting missed potential.

But one look at Ronaldo during the lineup/handshakes  said it all. and when game underway it just confirmed it. It also had a massive impact on the rest of the Brazilian team who just seemed lost especially in midfield/attack.

The individuals they have are quite good for their clubs, the group looks deceptively easier than it is, Mexico will still be firm competition for the last 16 and Saudi Arabia are good enough to be a 'banana slip' team for someone.

Do people really think that guys like Zieli≈Ñski or Milik just magically lose all their abilities once they put on the Poland shirt? Why doesn't anyone analyze or question things in any way? Like, people will trash Zieli≈Ñski because of his allegedly subpar NT performances, and yet they don't realize that the reason he's underperforming is because a) he's not positioned correctly during the games b) while he demands for the ball some jackass inevitably sends it flying over his head

Same with Milik, he doesn't really suck (in fact, he used to be pretty freaking good), it's just that his two major injuries altered his playstyle to the point where he doesn't really fit in the NT - he'd be good in the lone striker role, but that spot is reserved for Lewandowski.

___

I've added several new points to the unconfirmed rumors:

- Post about Drake getting aggressive with photographer after he snaps a pic of Drake + 2 young women exiting his/a helicopter

- A post insinuating that Drake requested nudes from his 18 year old date and her friends, without knowing whether or not they were of age

- A post insinuating that a minor was topless in Drake's dressing room

- A post about Drake possibly being connected to the porn-site Net Video Girls. This one is strange as fuck.

- The video of UK rapper Potter Payper calling out Drake for messaging young girls in England.

- Added the $530K settlement

- Added the big thread about CDAN - really worth a read, although questionable reputation.

- Added the comment regarding the model and dogbowls.

- Added the interview with Aya not being able to speak about sex with Drake because of 'court'.

____

New additions:

- Added more to the Bella Harris section including her dad's 'response' with the like on IG, because it led me to an old [StarTribune article](https://www.startribune.com/jimmy-jam-s-daughter-s-an-anti-kardashian/303679711/?refresh=true) where her mother is saying questionable things. 

- Removed the Lil CC section from unconfirmed rumors, as it was just repeated information.

- Added the Twitter video of the guy explaining his high school experience in regards to girls and Drake

___

More:

- Added Baka Not Nice under ties
- Added Adel 'Future' Nur under ties
- Added more information about the $350.000 settlement. Drake sued her for defamation, extortion etc. first, yet ended up paying her 350K? Hmm.
- Added a section about CDaN reputation under final notes
- Cleaned up the post a bit + some reformatting

___

Even more: 

- Added Shaye G's allegations
- Added ties to J Mulan who allegedly does trafficking for Drake and other celebrities
- Added ties to DJ Eric who also allegedly does trafficking for Drake

___

For the record:
 
I get a lot of DMs with people sending me stuff, and that's cool - but it has to be verifiable and sourced. I can't just post random screenshots because it ruins the credibility of the entire post. That's also why there's plenty of disclaimers throughout, there's an entire section for unconfirmed rumors and I specifically have a section regarding CDaN.

The same goes with the Omert√° stuff. There's no doubt it's shady and something might be going on, but I can't include it in the post until there's more verifiably sourced information.

___ 

More: 

- Added the TikTok 'investigation' that's been done by 51bworld in these two videos - [1](https://www.tiktok.com/@51bworld/video/7365487401369750826?_r=1&_t=8mB1AUJTFxW) and [2](https://www.tiktok.com/@51bworld/video/7366024091083623726?_r=1&_t=8mB0gw1LOk2).

- Added an overview at the top of the post

___

More: 

- Added Drake's age at each section regarding the celebrity girls as requested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1co5vrl/drake_has_a_clear_pattern_of_predatory_behavior/l3cfy9a/).

___

Final edit: 

This has gotten to the point where I get spammed with Reddit Care notifications and constant DMs with people providing new info, or wanna argue why I'm wrong and that Drake is completely innocent. You can believe whatever you want - I have presented my case and if you disagree, that's fine.

I personally do not believe that there can be this amount of smoke without fire and to everyone of you who claim I don't care about the girls, but just want to see Drake burn - that's projection my friends. You don't know me, what I do or what I stand for. 

And let me just set this straight: People complain about me adding a YouTube comment claiming that's dismissible. Sure, you can think that, but it just proves to everyone that you didn't read the entire post. This post is to prove the **pattern** of behavior. I know that can be difficult concept to grasp, even though I've explained it several times in the post. 

If you saw the amount of screenshots of comments I have in my DMs your mind would be blown, but because I actually try to make a credible post with links to sources I did not include them. I could easily have added 50 more points to the unconfirmed rumors with all kinds of claims, but it's extremely time consuming to source everything and then write it into the post. It's never good enough for people like you, but that's not my problem - that's a you-issue - stop being a debate pervert. 

I've also received comments and DMs saying that I hope Drake actually did something to these girls. I only have one response to that: Go fuck yourself. 

I will abandon this account and there won't be anymore updates to this post. As I've written in the OP, you are free to take this entire post and do whatever you want with it. No credit needed, I do not care.

This World Cup was meant to strengthen Qatar's power in the global trade network. Corporations don't give a fuck about what the average Joe thinks about them either, their main focus is making money and Qatar has plenty of that so they will continue to do business with them.

80% of Qatar's export revenue comes from Asia so even if North America and Europe entirely stop doing business with Qatar, they will still do fine. 

Same thing with Saudi Arabia, 80% of their export revenue comes from Asia and Africa and both of those continents do not care about Western views and values.

They've also been investing heavily in many regions including Europe and North America and in various industries so they have been diversifying their economy to rely less on their top exports. 

People think all these anti-Qatar articles will hurt Qatar's image, sure maybe to the average Joe in western countries but certainly not to their trade partners and not in non-western countries either. Qatar and Saudi Arabia will be fine. People need to wake up and understand how the real world works outside of Reddit, Twitter, and Western mainstream media. This is the typical Western elitism where Americans and Europeans think the world revolves around them which is far from reality.

**Some highlights from the legal filing**

It starts off with

>Niemann is a 19-year-old, self-taught chess prodigy. He brings this action to recover from the devastating damages that Defendants have inflicted upon his reputation, career, and life by egregiously defaming him and unlawfully colluding to blacklist him from the profession to which he has dedicated his life.

So you know it's gonna be good.

>Making matters worse for Carlsen, Niemann embarrassed Carlsen by playfully taunting him during his post-match interview. Notorious for his inability to cope with defeat, Carlsen snapped. Enraged that the young Niemann, fully 12 years his junior, dared to disrespect the ‚ÄúKing of Chess,‚Äù and fearful that the young prodigy would further blemish his multi-million dollar brand by beating him again, Carlsen viciously and maliciously retaliated against Niemann by falsely accusing Niemann, without any evidence, of somehow cheating during their in-person game and demanding that the organizers of the Sinquefield Cup immediately disqualify Niemann from the tournament.

Carlsen is very specifically known for being calm and mature when losing, so I'm not sure where this ""notorious inability"" comes from.

>Unbiased top chess analysts have dissected Niemann and Carlsen‚Äôs Sinquefield Cup game in excruciating detail and concluded that Niemann‚Äôs victory resulted more from Carlsen‚Äôs particularly poor play than Niemann‚Äôs particularly exceptional play.

This is absolutely amazing. I'm just basking in it.

>Despite the falsity of Defendants‚Äô accusations, Defendants‚Äô malicious defamation and unlawful collusion has, by design, destroyed Niemann‚Äôs remarkable career in its prime and ruined his life  
>  
>Nakamura has also had an acrimonious relationship with Niemann for several years, dating back to when they both worked as streamers for Chess.com and Nakamura viewed Niemann as a threat to his dominance on chess streaming platforms.

Hans, with all kindness, you were never even close to being a threat. You have 61,000 Twitch followers, he has 1.7 million. I'm not even a fan of Hikaru and I know that this is ridiculous.

>By all accounts, Niemann was a massive underdog, particularly given that Carlsen was playing with the white pieces, which afforded Carlsen the distinct competitive advantage of making the first move in the game. Yet, unlike the vast majority of Carlsen‚Äôs opponents, Niemann was not intimidated by Carlsen‚Äôs stature and did not play for a draw like most would have done. Niemann played to win. He attacked Carlsen early and flipped the advantage to the black pieces, which rattled Carlsen for the remainder of the game. Unnerved by Niemann‚Äôs unexpected confidence and early strategic advantage, Carlsen made numerous mistakes upon which Niemann capitalized to secure a tremendous victory over Carlsen, which, by all accounts, should have propelled Niemann‚Äôs career to the next level and allowed him to continue realizing his enormous potential as the next great American chess player. Unbeknownst to Niemann at the time, Defendants would do whatever it took ensure that this would never happen.

This reads like someone making their first anime OC for a chess show, and making him the single most overpowered and edgy player ever, while everyone conspires against him, especially his bitter rival (who fans will 100% ship with him). But he will not be overcome by them, because by the ~~heart of the cards~~ beads of the board, he can beat anyone.

Honestly, I'd watch that show.

>As a result of this shocking defeat, Carlsen snapped. Unable to accept the reality of his unexpected loss, Carlsen reflexively retaliated by defaming Niemann to Michael Khodarkovsky, the Executive Director of the Grand Chess Tour, falsely accusing Niemann of cheating during their game and demanding that Niemann be immediately disqualified ... Because Carlsen had absolutely no evidence of Niemann‚Äôs cheating, Khodarkovsky refused to comply with Carlsen‚Äôs dictatorial command

""Your honor, my client was so fucking awesome at chess that he drove his opponent to madness""

It should go without saying that Khodarkovsky has confirmed that Magnus made no such request.

>After Carlsen succeeded in laying the groundwork against Niemann with his initial defamatory accusations of cheating, he unleashed the full force of his newly-broadened media empire to publicly bolster those allegations and drown out any legitimate sources of opposition that demonstrated why Carlsen‚Äôs allegations were untrue

What media empire? The man owns a chess app and has a Twitter account.

>To bolster this unprecedented joint ban, which effectively blacklisted Niemann from professional chess, Nakamura leveraged his platform as Chess.com‚Äôs top streamer and credibility as a top chess player to engage in an all-out blitz of defamatory accusations

Well, this is just ridiculous. As we all know, an all out chess blitz can last a *maximum* of ten minutes (as per FIDE regulations), and Hikaru streamed for far longer than that. Honestly, how can a supposed professional know so little about blitz chess?

j7j4hmq,t3_10tin5t,"Great writeup! I'd like to read two more pieces of evidence into the record, if I may.

First, a lot of people speculated that Hans' rating would fall off a cliff after this accusation. The reasoning being that if he was unfairly gaining an edge by cheating, and then was suddenly placed under increased scrutiny that would stop him from continuing to cheat, then his performances would revert back to whatever his true playing strength was.

That hasn't happened. He's had some up and downs, like any player, but in the last few months his average performance rating is pretty much exactly in line with the 2700-rated, top-40-in-the-world level that he was at before the accusation.

Second, in Magnus' most recent tournament, he got off to an uncharacteristically rocky start by his standards. This included his first two-game losing streak since 2015, the second game of which he lost, with the white pieces, to Nodirbek Abdusattorov, another prodigy even younger than Hans with almost exactly the same rating.

Magnus then rebounded and finished in a strong second place. But the picture this paints is of a player who is extremely strong, and still comfortably the best in the world, but who isn't unbeatable to nearly the same degree that he was a few years ago. And the idea that a 2700-rated teenager might just happen to play better than that guy on a given day is actually not that hard to believe.",Quintaton_16,,32,32,2023-02-07 03:56:05

And everyone that ended up sorta being on his side talking in similarly euphemistic term, comes off as rather duplicitous to me. No can really prove anything, but in practice they're still accusing Niemann and Niemann simply lashed out against it.

It feels a lot like political mudslinging before the age of Trump -- you know what they're trying to say, but they're just skirting around it, and it comes off worse than if they're just being upfront, emotional, and human about it.

As someone who was only aware of Magnus as ""that young prodigy"", the narrative after everyone muddied the water, feels picture perfect like what we're taught fictional media (and other e-sport) as the way an entitled top player would response in anger when he lost to a less-favored opponent. It's really a complicated drama with a lot of underlying tension in it, but it's lost in translation because it took so long for everyone to be direct about it.

I think chess as a sport hadn't realized that over-night they became an e-sport and should probably conduct more like an established e-sport does. Particularly with PR, because it's really not a good look when the story takes a life on its own until it gets boiled down to ""top chess player lost to a trash player -- gets angry and accuses him of cheating using buttplug.""

(Apologies if I'm restating things you wrote, I read thru over multiple sittings)

One possible avenue of cheating I saw speculated was via a (potentially purposeful) leak in Magnus's camp. Magnus let's it be known within in camp or just to the suspected leaker(s) that he's going with an unusual opening. When Hans is magically prepped for it, that's a sign he is cheating. It's a little cloak and dagger-y and doesn't jive with the sense given by Hikaru that Magnus has long suspected Hans, but would explain the confidence and steadfastness that Magnus has in the allegation of Hans as a cheater.

One other thing to note (this is what I think OP could have already covered), is that cheating at this level doesn't have to be play Rook to A5. It could be as simple as the computer engine sees this as a pivotal turning point in the match, so I'm signalling you to tell you to look harder for a premium move and this juncture.",OhTheGrandeur,,67,67,2023-02-04 16:25:19

j7706nc,t3_10tin5t,">(especially since Magnus played white, a major advantage)

This is what's crazy to me about chess. Generally, when you've got some incredibly high level of skill involved in a game like this, where people obsess over it for their entire lives and have careers centered around the game, you can be pretty sure that the game is completely 100% fair for both players. I mean, to pick a similar example in video games, look at Super Smash Bros Melee, a game with nowhere near the history or longevity or in-depth obsessiveness of chess, and all the changes they've made to the way it's played at a competitive level over the last twenty years in order to make sure it is *absolutely perfectly balanced*. Removing items. Limiting the stages to only a tiny fraction of those available. Placing limits on the number of times you're allowed to grab the edge of the stage. And those limitations only continue to get stricter over time to make sure nobody ever has an unfair advantage, no matter how slight.

But chess--the absolute granddaddy of all competitive board games--isn't balanced. This has been known since the 1800s, and all the statistics support it: white will win more often than not. And it's not like this is only a thing at low-level play, either. It actually becomes *more* of an issue when the players are at a higher level, and even more so when computers play against each other. It's genuinely bizarre to me that chess, of all things, is so noticeably unfair for one player.",IHad360K_KarmaDammit,,82,82,2023-02-04 15:48:37

j779ij7,t3_10tin5t,"As someone who reads legal complaints all day to decide on MSJ, MJP, preliminary objections, and other legal nonsense, the Complaint really isn't that remarkable. If anything, the paragraphs should have been broken down further, but I don't work in Missouri, so it's possible that the standard form is just different in Missouri and wherever his attorneys are from (assuming somewhere in the northeast since Niemann is from Connecticut? Massachusetts? Somewhere around there).

What's more telling about the lawsuit is that it hasn't yet been dismissed. It was filed on October 20; preliminary objections or an answer would have needed to be filed by mid-November. Let's assume that POs were filed rather than an answer. A complaint can be thrown out on preliminary objections for a few reasons, the plaintiff can be ordered to amend the complaint, or the objections are denied and the defendants are ordered to answer. Clearly the complaint wasn't thrown out. 

If it was ordered to be amended, that means the amended complaint would have been due a few weeks ago (motion filed mid November, answer due early to mid December (again, unfamiliar with MO's rules, but my jurisdiction is 20 days to respond, so I'm assuming they're somewhere around 20-30, since that's pretty standard in the US), then amended complain due late December to early January (20-30 days again). Then the process repeats. 

If the POs were denied, then the defendants would be ordered to answer the complaint within 20-30 days, so early/mid December. We *have* to assume given public knowledge so far that there will be affirmative defenses/new matter raised in the answer. Niemann's response would be due 20-30 days later, effectively closing the pleadings stage. (If they filed an answer instead of preliminary objections (unlikely but possible), move all the dates forward about a month and a half.) At that point, the defendants' attorneys would be remiss to not file a motion for judgment on the pleadings, if the case is so slam dunk (without seeing exhibits attached to an answer, I'm not buying that it's slam dunk enough for MJP). Eventually, summary judgment motions will be filed, but those will come further down the line after discovery, including depositions like from Ken Regan. It may get tossed on MSJ based on further evidence, like what Regan has to say on the matter, but that's pretty far down the line.

Basically what I'm saying is that the lawsuit is not as much nonsense as you think it is. Is Niemann likely to win? Idk, probably not, but juries can be weird. I've seen cases where it's a slam dunk for one side or the other, and the jury just decides they don't like a lawyer, so they decide for the other side. The fact that Carlson was, as you put it, ""playing middle school games"" over the accusations may not sit right with the jury, especially because it was obvious what he was saying. Niemann's attitude may not sit right with them. The other thing to keep in mind is that it depends on whether the reports of cheating online will even be admissible as evidence, since it's definitely going to be a motion in limine if the case makes it to trial. It's not habit evidence, which is admissible under the federal rules of evidence, as it hasn't occurred frequently enough. It's prior bad acts, which typically aren't admissible evidence when they aren't analogous. Cheating online and cheating OTB are two very different things, and even the report acknowledged that. Only time will tell, but the lawsuit is going to be interesting regardless.",kcvngs76131,,30,30,2023-02-04 16:51:42

This is my takeaway as well, there was definitely enough speculation about Hans' suspicious playstyle that Magnus must've been thinking about this whilst playing. Magnus also has been brewing on cheating in chess for a while and after making some judgement errors OTB decided this was the time to save his own ass by accusing Hans.

Magnus definitely has a point about needing more countermeasures but tanked his reputation to prove a point.

And I think the whole Chess.com banning him thing ""oh we swear it's not in retribution"" is pretty colossal horseshit, since they conducted the investigation in response.

j7ajc4z,t3_10tin5t,"I think Hans is an ass, butt:

* The most damning thing was his interview right after the game, but he is known to be someone who doesn't like interviews, doesn't put any effort in them at all and is sarcastic as hell. So trusting anything he says or drawing conclusions from it I think was a mistake that a lot of people made.

* The chesscom report said more about chesscom than Hans. First off, why did they publish it? In it, they reveal that they coerce people into confessing cheating in order to unlock their account. They also included emails and phone call transcripts which were assured at the time to be confidential. Just really scummy stuff, and for what? All they needed to do was to leave it at ""We're certain he cheated online a lot more than he says he did and that's why he was banned before."" But to betray confidentiality and just decide to ban him again seemed really immature.

* I think most ppl would agree sport is much better off that this happened. Cheating prevention is taken more seriously now. That the guy to take the fall is an egotistical jerk I suppose is not the worst outcome.

One thing I'd say is that compared to us, Korea, Japan, Iran they tend to mentally collpase after conceding a couple and that's when the blow-outs start. If Renard has instilled some more resilience which I think is very possible noting their improved away performances - a typical weakness - then I think we'll see a good WC from them.",angusozi,,24,24,2022-10-28 20:34:54

When they qualified it put a big, dumb smile on my face because I always remember them having good participations. In 2010 obviously... Things happened, and I totally understand why they might not like us, or at the very least why they surely despise Luis Su√°rez. A part of me wants to say that he'll start as a sort of decoy and as a mental tactic, but his knees are far too gone and he'll probably be rested and Darwin will be upfront with Cavani or alone. I do hope he gets to see the pitch that game, though. If we were in a World Cup with real atmosphere, I'd say something to the effect of 'I can't wait to hear the two fan sections chanting at each other, the whistles for Su√°rez"" so on and so forth. However, this World Cup is not gonna have the same party atmosphere, sadly.

He's pragmatic and I respect him for that. The journalist's questions reek of partiality.

War is obviously terrible, I dislike Putin and the Russian Government but I'd do the same if I was Rybus. He has lived in Russia for over 10 years and his wife and children are also Russian. He's putting the needs of his family first. There are over 40,000 Poles in Russia, and yet he alongside a few are singled out. Is it because he's relatively rich?...If he decided to stay in Russia but not play professionally would it still be okay in some commenters views. If you did research most Russians are actually against the war.

Some of the responses here reek of hypocrisy. I reckon most commenters on this thread are from Western nations, who have and are continuously involved in benefiting from the wars/conflicts, destabilization of developing nations worldwide (USA, UK and France especially).

Why isn't there pressure on athletes, celebrities and other influencers from western nations considering their atrocities, massacres and wars waged all over the world especially in Africa and The Middle East. How about the big Investment Banks, Big 4 Auditors, and consulting firms and their links to profiteering of global warfare.

Group stage is disappointing.

Round of 16 is the objective.

Anything beyond is an absolute fairytale!

I'm talking about the level we should deliver considering how we played at he AFCON at our best, but from what I see from us recently, I'm not sure we have the level to go through the round of 16.

I know that we can show our best when nobody believe in us, but when we are supposed to at least get a draw, when underperformed badly. One common joke we have regarding this situation is saying that we will loose against Switzerland and Serbia, but for some reason, we'll win against Brazil.

On a more personal note, it's the first time we have a World Cup during school, so it will something new to watch us play with my classmates during dry season. I am used to watch the World Cup at home with family during holiday (on wet season).",MutedBar4,,30,30,2022-11-16 16:57:44

About the good parts, I'm not sure. Things will be more streamlined if the last stages are played in US than in any country of the multibidders for the next one.

About the options, it may not be a good idea to choose the CONMEBOL one. The final would be played probably in Uruguay (the Centenario stadium have the proper name for being the final 100 years later than the first, even if its dated for today's standards). Organizing current cup costed Qatar more than Uruguay's external debt, that kind of money could be better used to improve our economy instead of something that won't give us so much economic advantages, will be a corruption and distraction circus for 2+ government periods whatever party is in charge, and the other countries won't be better. And the switching between countries will be a logistics nightmare for the low infrastructure than what we have. And I don't know how the other partners will be doing this decade, but the forecast doesn't looks good so far.

About the other options, Spain+Portugal+Ukraine may win just because politics (not sport) and it is a process that may get ugly, the Saudi Arabia one looks like Qatar 2.0 (but Egypt and Saudi Arabia have good precedents on participating in previous world cup, and Greece could tie the loop with the Olympics that were shared in the first FIFA championships). And Morocco, for being a single country, and with a bit of luck, this cup winner, could be something interesting.

Anyway, we are living in interesting times, I don't know how this decade will play out in world's peace, economy and environment. Bidding for a word cup with 8 years in advance may be a risky bet.",gmuslera,,9,9,2022-12-10 23:52:18

She has a great story as well, she made her debut for the senior team at 16 years old and is the most capped defender in the national team's history despite being only 27 years old. I think the big limiting factor for the team is that our team is extremely short ‚Äì Ch∆∞∆°ng is 166cm and is considered quite tall. Don't look up the heights of our goalkeepers. This team is not going to be winning many physical battles.

My idealistic scenario is that Hu·ª≥nh Nh∆∞ scores a goal, I think that would be an amazing storyline for her and the team in general, but all I'm realistically hoping for is to just avoid being a redux of 2019 Thailand.

iht0oss,t3_w934f2,"### Bonus Drama #2 ‚Äì Dropping Truth Bombs
Even though this runs parallel to the Altador Cup drama, I kept this part separate because the accusations are pretty severe (in terms of in-game consequences), and come from a controversial source. Personally, I‚Äôm convinced the information is real, and most of the players are convinced too, so I did want to cover this in some capacity.

Back in 2020, a Twitter user [posted a thread](https://twitter.com/johnjhacking/status/1342921353310027776) about multiple security flaws in the Neopets website that allowed them to get a copy of the site‚Äôs source code. (This is likely NOT the same person who recently put Neopets‚Äô userdata, source code, and live database access up for sale.) They worked with TNT devs to patch things up, but the source code was already out there, and white-hats weren‚Äôt the only ones with a copy.

The next year, a grey-hat using the name neo_truths began posting on the r/Neopets subreddit, claiming to have figured out certain bugged features and sharing the relevant snippets of code. They claimed to have a copy of the site‚Äôs source code and live database access. (This, too, is likely NOT the same person who  recently put Neopets‚Äô userdata, source code, and live database access up for sale. No, we are not okay over at Neopets.com, thanks for asking.) The closest we can get to verifiable proof comes from their post about [The Golden Dubloon bug.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/ne5h7o/golden_dubloon_another_bug_to_fix/)

The Golden Dubloon is basically a gambling game structured like a restaurant. You buy some foods ‚Äúfor your pet‚Äù, your pet ‚Äúeats‚Äù them, and if you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôll be sent home with leftovers. The problem was, the restaurant has an occupancy limit, and for years it was often above that limit. Meaning players couldn‚Äôt use the feature for long stretches of time.

According to neo_truth‚Äôs post, the code allowed unscrupulous users to bypass the occupancy limit and submit a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù request to add to the already overflowing occupancy count. Two days later, the bug was fixed. Given the obscurity of the bug, and the timing of the fix, I‚Äôm personally convinced the fix came as a direct result of neo_truth‚Äôs post.
 
Their next bug hunt tracked down an error with the NPC shops where [items of rarity 100 were made invisible](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/npzffe/restocking_r100s_oldest_neo_bug/) to all players. Rare items are supposed to be invisible to brand news accounts to prevent autobuyers, but rarity 100 items remain invisible even to aged accounts. They followed this up with [a short video](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/nu4k5o/r100_restocking_mummified_hot_dog_has_been_added/) showing that they could restock one of these invisible r100 items by figuring out the stock id.

Of course, they could still be making this all up. Or maybe they solved some real bugs to establish credibility, and used that to start posting fake stuff that they knew would play into confirmation biases and rile up the community.

That brings us to neo_truth‚Äôs Altador Cup series. Alongside every dramatic happening of this year‚Äôs cup, neo_truths had a behind-the-scenes insight to make it even worse.

Remember the tiebreaker for 6th place that allowed the ACG into the Upper Bracket? Neo_truths [made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/vllt43/ac_how_dc_ended_up_in_top_bracket/) simulating different tiebreakers to figure out how that happened. Their first post showed the actual decimal scores (something that has always been hidden from the players) for the three teams, showing that, depending on another minor bug in the system, either Mystery Island or Kreludor would have had the highest score total. For the ACG to be placed in the Upper Bracket, according to neo_truths, must have been human error.

Then they came back with a new discovery: if you simply feed a list of each team‚Äôs Round Robin wins into a built-in PHP sort function, it would spit out a list with the ACG in 6th place.

Neo_truth‚Äôs [next post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/vn2tfv/ac_a_glimpse_on_cheating/) exposed a group of dozens of accounts, all likely owned by the same person, using scoresenders to inflate a team‚Äôs scores. This was the ACG2 I talked about earlier, that showed up on the last day of Round Robin to deny Meridell/SOTAC‚Äôs perfect record. This one wasn‚Äôt too revealing, since everyone who followed the cup closely already knew the scores were indicative of an ACG influence.

The final post I want to highlight came the same day the official standings were posted. Titled [‚ÄúWhat I know‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/vtrx9r/ac_what_i_know/), neo_truths listed several relevant changes that led to the mess the users had been presented with. I‚Äôm going to cover these changes in two groups. The first group affects the final standing:

1. Round Robin wins did not affect final standings.

2. Brackets were locked.

3. All teams except Faerieland had their Finals scores nerfed by varying amounts. (No insight as to why.)

The first two make sense. In fact, those are good changes. It‚Äôs the third one that caused the mess. Neo_truths gave the nerf percentages for each team, but I‚Äôll just highlight a few of the interesting ones. Meridell/SOTAC‚Äôs scores were reduced by 58%, Mystery Island‚Äôs scores were reduced by 50%, some Upper and Middle Bracket teams were hit by as much as 60%, but the ACG (the eventual ‚Äúwinners‚Äù) received only a 30% reduction. Interestingly, Kiko Lake got hit with a 53% reduction. While previously a top contender, Kiko Lake‚Äôs core took this year off. They lost all their matches in the Round Robin stage and were seeded into the Lower Bracket. They lost all their matches there too. They finished the cup without a single match victory. And after that, they got nerfed by 53%.

The nerfs themselves made no sense, but players now at least had some insight into how the final standings had been chosen. What players still needed from TNT, though, was why did they take their nerf bat to so many of the legitimate teams?!

The second group of revelations is far more impactful. According to the post, TNT has implemented a new shadowbanning system, and they added hundreds of players to the list just before releasing the final standings. A shadowban‚Äîaccording to both neo_truths and a trusted Altador Cup enthusiast [who was shown the code snippet and queries](https://i.imgur.com/5SfEbkN.png) to verify‚Äî will allow the player to continue earning personal rank points, but their games will not be added to their team‚Äôs totals. In other words, if you‚Äôre shadowbanned, you would be playing the Altador Cup just for yourself. Of course, the whole point of a shadowban is that you don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre shadowbanned, so hardcore players would have ended up wasting hours a day trying to help their teams.

Another factor that makes these shadowbans believable is that TNT has tried something like this before. Back in 2017, TNT implemented a ‚Äúflagging‚Äù system that would mark suspicious players and prevent them from earning any points‚Äîeither for themselves or their team. Lots of accounts also got banned, but many of those were later undone, suggesting that even TNT knew they had caught a lot of false positives. It was an extremely unpopular system, and TNT did away with it after that year. So these new shadowbans‚Äîif real‚Äîwould just be a slight variation of the old flagging system. [And the players aren‚Äôt having it.](https://i.imgur.com/7irlC4p.png)

Neo_truths also claimed that the final team scores were not recalculated after the shadowbans were applied, meaning the nerfs that rearranged the standings were done separate from the hundreds of shadowbans.

While neo_truths did not post the list of shadowbanned names, they did confirm account names for any users or team leaders who DMed them. Plenty of the active, long-time players from the onsite forums and the r/Neopets Discord server are all on the shadowban list, and it‚Äôs difficult to believe that there aren‚Äôt a considerable number of false positives in there. Also according neo_truths, the shadowbans are currently set to remain in place for next year‚Äôs cup too.

Once again, I‚Äôll try to be fair to TNT and try to see this from their perspective: how do you go about catching a cheater in the Altador Cup? Well, if that cheater isn‚Äôt dumb enough to number their accounts for you, it‚Äôs actually pretty difficult, just going by game scores.

Regular players, using only a single account, have a max number of scores they can send each day in each game. If they want to help their team, and they can already max out their daily games, then their only option left is to increase their scores per game. So higher scores are not inherently suspicious. Meanwhile, if you‚Äôre part of the ACG and you‚Äôre using scoresenders on a bunch of different junk accounts, you don‚Äôt need to raise your scores above the minimum. Just add more accounts. And TNT can‚Äôt say minimum scores are suspicious either, because that‚Äôs how lots of legitimate players farm personal rank points when they‚Äôre not worried about their team‚Äôs standing.

There is no good threshold to use for finding cheaters, so you‚Äôre guaranteed to get a lot of false positives. But what rate of false positives is acceptable? Considering there is no material benefit to being on the winning team, I‚Äôd say there is no acceptable rate. If you can‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôre catching cheaters, then leave the individual accounts alone. We‚Äôve already seen the picture captchas are effective at stopping scoresenders, and we‚Äôve seen TNT manually move teams around at will. There‚Äôs no reason to be messing with shadowbans and guaranteed false positives when TNT has already had success suppressing the ACG‚Äôs influence at the team level.",dfgh5067,,937,937,2022-07-27 03:17:33
iht6wzd,t3_w934f2,"I know it's cliche to point out how the management team makes nonsensical decisions, but I really am stumped by how they're handling this. Why would you remove captchas? Why would you arbitrarily change scores for matches that were not, as far as we know, involved in botting? Why not just punish the team that bots all the way rather than just nerf them a little?

I *do* know that this is one of the worst ways to run a tournament.

If you mess with the results of a tournament without explanation, you tell the players that their hours of effort means nothing.  That the results they manage might just be erased for convenience or even shits and giggles.  That's going to have the immediate effect of the players just not caring anymore.

Either don't mess with the results at all, or mess with them and provide an explanation.  Messing with them with no explanation just guarantees that you piss the maximum amount of people.",Lodgik,,65,65,2022-07-27 06:22:47

This speculation has been debunked. The apostrophe was from an apple device instead of a windows desktop/android device. But Selen used apple devices that resulted in the same apostrophe in past tweets.

The actual reason people believe that she didn't post that message is because her termination notice said that she was unreachable during the time it was posted, and they were communicating with her emergency contact but could not come to a resolution, and thus removed access to her social media accounts. Which really sounds like they were talking to her mom, trying to get her claim culpability while in the hospital, but she wouldn't concede, so they just posted on her behalf.",moldybrie,,40,40,2024-02-08 03:00:01

""As an overseas viewer I will like to add some context to it. The video explains the Selen case really good. But I would just like to add a few things. Since December 2022 Nijisanji EN has caused a lot of drama. From small to large. I may not know much about the Nijisanji JP but in EN at least it managed to garnered a really bad reputation. Every week Nijisanji never failed to make drama from small to large. And graduation as well as termination of talents happened every month. Especially in the case of a talent named Zaion Lanza who had a termination similiar to Selen. But unlike Selen, many people didn't support Zaion. It is unfortunate, but Zaion did many faults as an agency talent. But Nijisanji EN actually exaggerated a lot of what she did. It came to the point where Zaion seems like a scum. The talent behind Zaion then made a statement where in it she clarify a lot of Nijisanji EN termination and told her experience. The clarification showed the bad side of Nijisanji EN. Since then even though the fan base of Nijisanji EN doubt her words, but after more then months of constant termination, graduation, show of management incompetence the people just lose trust completely within the company. This peaked in Selen's termination. Selen is beloved by people, not just her fanbase but by other content creator and artists. When Nijisanji terminate her.

* It basically was throwing Selen Tatsuki/Dokibird under the bus Zaion-style.
* They also broke NDA between Doki, her lawyers, and Niji's lawyers. The legal documents, therefore some information stated in the stream, were supposed to stay between Niji and Doki.
* THEN Anycolor/Nijisanji CEO Tazumi released a [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1apkx3g/riku_tazumi_statement/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) apologizing for the use of the word ""negligible"" in the statement to investors and how it was insensitive to the EN audience. However it was still Corpo-PR speak and towards investors than fans or Selen/Doki
* So now Niji has two statements that annoy the EN audience
* Then Niji claims they didn't break NDA, because they broke NDA to tell Livers who aren't under NDA to tell the EN audience stuff that was under NDA

    Users point out that multiple Nijisanji twitter accounts have released statements asking their fans to watch the announced video. The language used in each tweet was noted as being suspicious considering the confirmed allegations of management taking over talents' twitter accounts in order to serve as mouthpieces for the company.

    A notable example is Rosemi Lovelock's twitter account

    who admitted to committing herself to social media blackout for her mental wellbeing. Despite that, her account STILL retweeted the new announcement.

In this particular case, Nijisanji could have just said nothing post graduation and let the legal proceeding play out by itself (remember Doki said herself she was willing to move on). Instead, Nijisanji went on the offensive, which in turn ruined their brand in the eyes of their fans.

I don't see how Nijisanji EN will survive for more than another half a year. The most valuable part of the agency is their brand.

lk4qcs3,t3_1alimfx,"For those of you who are reading this post I would like to say something on the matter.

1. I myself am not pro any sides in this matter except the side that is neutral.
2. I would like to say that I myself enjoy content from many different livers of nijisanji including members from all, JP, ID, KR, EN, and even their CN branch.
3. However the fact in the matter is that Selen herself has said that she wants everyone to show kindness to all parties involved in the matter and whether we like it or not that includes ANYCOLOR. If anyone claims that they are a fan of selen but throws anger or hatred towards any who are involved then I am sorry to say but they are being hypocrites.

In my perspective from what I read and heard both parties involved are at fault and validated. Yes Nijisanji could have provided better support to Selen but Selen also could have don't better on her part as well by not breaching her contract. Listen to this carefully. When you join a company there are rules that one must follow that the company makes and it is all included in the contract and whether you like the rules or not if you want to join and be part of the company then you must follow the rules in your contract. Once she signs the contract any and all breach of contract from her is her fault. This applies to any and all companies and this is common sense and everyone knows it. However Selen herself can make mistakes and I understand that as she is human but I also understand that ANYCOLOR can also make mistakes as they are human as well. Again I am not taking either sides but I am just speaking the truth based on how I see it. Selen had the option of not signing the contract as well in the beginning however she did. This means to some degree she is also responsible for what happened.

One thing that triggers me is how people are saying hurtful things about Nijisanji that they have no proof of and as you know that can mislead people to thinking the same thing. The way how I see is what happened happened and I can't jump to conclusions based on my emotions. What I know for certain is that there are things that I like about Nijisanji and things that I don't and the same goes for selen as well as actions from both sides can effect also the other talents as well. However what Nijisanji did is something that they felt as a company that they had to do and while sad what is done is done. One example of this is unsubscribing from channels you love just to provoke the company because you think that they take over their livers accounts and use it to say stuff. I repeat. We have no evidence of this and for all we know what we hear can be the honest feeling of the vtuber that is speaking. If this is the case then the only thing we are doing is harming the vtuber we love. 

I myself now will go and support Dokibird for who she is because just because she went back to being her old avatar and that she went independent does not change the fact that she is still the Selen that I know and love. After all I did not love Selen for being a nijisanji liver but for being the vtuber Selen and while her status changed from being part of a company to being indie and her avatar character changed it does not change the fact that she is the same Selen that I know and love. I believe that this is what Selen wants people(especially her fans) to do rather then trying to provoke nijisanji and make the fire bigger.",Rare_Yogurt_7533,,4,4,2024-08-27 05:15:58

If she were inclined to release a very similar song, could she get a strike despite (in theory) there being no way to know of the similarities? Or maybe she just does a cheeky unarchived karaoke...

kqjuobc,t3_1alimfx,"From the perspective of a Nijisanji EN fan who's made the decision to stick by them, I think this is a good and clear timeline.
 
I would like to say however that I'm getting extremely anxious about the mass amount of dogpiling and harassment the remaining livers have been getting. Some may argue it's deserved, but like...so many of the hashtags, especially Elira, Vox, Enna, Millie,, Scarle, etc. are filled with people who have never watched them in their lives telling them to kill themselves, posting dox photos, telling them to graduate. Streams and YT comments, same thing. Kurosanji, #SinktheYacht, racist caricature porn. 

While I don't think the Monday stream was disastrous, I believe it was an attempt at transparency from their side. It's gotten to the point where fan accounts who try to post positivity hashtags or try to explain things more neutrally also get bombarded. A cosplayer on Instagram who had cosplayed NijiEN in the past was sent death threats and a flood of report to take her account down. I feel like I'm going crazy because it feels like outside of the community, everyone either is rooting it on or will shrug and say ""that's unfortunate. they have to be collateral, though, because of their bad company"" or ""I hope they graduate soon, hate the company not the livers"", and watch on with zero sympathy. 

In the long run, it'll be extremely poisonous for Doki too; these people don't care about supporting her, they just want to use her name as a vessel to harass livers as """"""justice"""""" or """"""revenge"""""" or a witchhunt to ""punish the bullies"". 

I'm just sad and stressed. I hate seeing people who only learned some livers' names last week come in and start calling them bootlickers or slurs or spreading wild accusations that range from annoying to straight-up dangerous.",chewingfuriously,,-3,-3,2024-02-15 16:21:13

jkxp187,t3_13ktaju,"This made my day. I grew up in the Soviet Union (and yes, I had to do figure skating as a kid but always preferred hockey), and skating is on par with football and hockey in popularity, prominence and prestige. 

Sadly, I wasn‚Äôt shocked at all about the costumes, poor judgment and worse reaction to criticism. I can offer some context but please don‚Äôt mistake it for excuses. Russia, despite being home to dozens if not hundreds of ethnic groups, remains at its general foundations rather homogenous, where people of color in particular (thinking here of my Angolan friends who studied at Lumumba uni) were ‚Äúothered‚Äù and treated as exotic demon aliens at best and inferior subhumans at worst. 

Unfortunately, even if things may have improved in major cities with advent of travel and internet, a lot of the ignorant attitudes remain, particularly in older generation. There is also just plain ignorance and indifference at play too, as with the pseudo(?) Native American hand over mouth gesture (I remember it used a but when I was a kid in somewhat mocking, somewhat playful way), and the MƒÅori rubbing of noses greeting (my dad used to do it playfully to me when I was little, as a goofy sign of affection - but he was a merchant marine who‚Äôs been around and always talked about these incredible strange places).   In Russian, ‚Äú–∞–±–æ—Ä–∏–≥–µ–Ω‚Äù may have a broader geographic meaning than what would be culturally accepted by the native people, and is often used in pop culture as such (as an example, a very famous Vysotksi song goes ‚Äú–Ω—É –ø–æ—á–µ–º—É –∞–±–æ—Ä–∏–≥–µ–Ω—ã —Å—ä–µ–ª–∏ –ö—É–∫–∞‚Äù - ‚Äúwhy did the aboriginals ate Captain Cook‚Äù - and I assure you not one of us would know if the native people of the Cook Islands would refer to themselves as aboriginal).

jslg1g5,t3_153oyxp,"I wouldn't rate Sch√ºller or Anyomi as key players, as both are usually not in the first team, despite not lacking the talent.

Key will be the defense, especially Svenja Huth, who will replace Giulia Gwinn at the right back position despite not playing there for 8 years (she has been playing offensive right winger). So that will be a challenge to get defensive stability there.

Interior defense also has me worried, especially a lack of speed lately.

&#x200B;

As for the Zambia game, Oberdorf is in many regards THE ultra-key-player like Schweinsteiger war in the 2014 men's world cup. She exited the Zambia game due to injury (thankfully nothing serious) at halftime, when it was still 0-0. Oberdorf excels in nearly all parts of her position as defensive midfielder, anchoring not only the defense but with her hard playing style making it difficult for opposing forwards. But her offensive skill is also impressive, for example her pass in november 2022 in a game against the USA which bridged almost the entire opposing team and lead to the 2-1 victory goal.

While replacing top players is never easy, it is basically impossible to replace Oberdorf adequately. When she is out, it not only means a significant decrease at the position, but it also kind of breaks the game which Germany play - thus being really ultra key.",dwujd,,10,10,2023-07-19 14:42:06
jslla51,t3_153oyxp,"I feel like Korea are in a weird position right now. They're staunchly clinging onto the previous generation but simply do not have the talents coming through at the youth level to be able to replace them. You have veterans in that team who were actually in the 2003 (!) squad.

That midfield core of Cho So-hyun, Ji So-yun and Lee Geum-min is gonna keep the team together but beyond that, its a worry. They even had to resort to bringing in a 16 year old high school player from the US. 

They have huge issues throughout the team. Lee Min-a is a big loss after doing her cruciate in because that leaves the midfield incredibly light. This is a team that is VERY defensive orientated and will look to defend leads and keep things as tight as possible. You ain't gonna see much goals from them. They're much more of a threat on the counter. When having to take the incentive and be creative, they struggle. You saw that in the Asian Cup last year. They could barely break down Myanmar but easily caused Japan problems despite having 30% possession. Their shock win over Australia was pretty much the same thing.

in6umtx,t3_x6i2cl,"The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.

For context to all the non-footy fans here. The 2022 FIFA World Cup will be held in Qatar from November 22nd to December 18th. 

The US qualified after disastrously missing the 2018 World Cup in Russia and will be in Group B with Wales, England, and Iran. There are seven other groups for a total of 32 teams. Each team plays the other teams in their group once and the top two teams in each group advance to the knockout rounds. The U.S. has advanced to the knockout rounds in three of the last five World Cups. 

Just to start off, the **TL;DR version** is that there are many pros and cons to visiting as it is a very controversial tournament. 

I personally, am against the President visiting as it is an absurdity that they were even able to host. 

**Arguments in favor:** 

* The U.S., together with Mexico and Canada, is hosting the next World Cup in 2026. Usually, the heads of state for the following World Cup host country at least attend the final, if not matches involving their country. 
* The U.S. team is actually really talented. This is probably the most talented team the U.S. has ever had with many players playing at the top professional levels in Europe. Plus, with a very manageable group, a run to the quarter-finals is not out of the question. Winning the whole thing is very unlikely though. 
* The World Cup is probably the biggest sporting event on the planet. The Olympics get similar eyeballs, but countries don't get brought to a standstill over someone winning the Gold Medal in fencing. They do when their national team is playing in the World Cup though. 
* Biden recently designated Qatar a [major non-NATO ally](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-designates-qatar-major-non-nato-ally-us-2022-03-10/). Not attending might be seen as a snub, especially if the U.S. gets far into the knockout rounds. 
* Qatar also has one of the largest U.S. military bases overseas. It's always nice to visit the troops. 
* They have a lot of oil and gas, something the west needs now because of the Ukraine crisis. 
* We are playing not one, but *two* British teams, England and Wales (the four U.K. nations compete separately in soccer). It would be a good time to meet with the new U.K. PM Liz Truss. 
* Iran is also in our group. It might be a good opportunity to meet with them to revive an Iran Nuclear Deal. 
* It's after the midterms. 

**Arguments Against:**

* Qatar almost certainly bribed FIFA officials to get the bid. A World Cup, it should be noted, the U.S., along with Australia, Japan, and South Korea, was also bidding for. 
* FIFA is an incredibly corrupt organization that the DOJ launched a massive anti-corruption probe against in 2015. It has improved a little bit under their current President Gianni Infantino, but not much in my opinion. He has also been repeatedly singing Qatar's praises lately. 
* There is a possibility that Iran will engage in all sorts of absurd political shenanigans around our match with them.
* Qatar has been accused of [massive labor exploitation](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/23/revealed-migrant-worker-deaths-qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022) to build new stadiums for the tournament. At least 6,500 workers, most of whom were expat workers from South Asian countries, have died. The ones who live are subject to substandard living conditions, often have their passports taken away, and are not always paid like they were promised. In addition to having to work long hours in scorching Arabian heat. 
* Qatar has also been accused of [funding terrorist organizations](https://apnews.com/article/islamic-state-group-religion-syria-lawsuits-middle-east-75e15fcfc4b2c0dcdd18ff16e2556a20) or at least looking the other way when it comes to funding terrorism. It's alleged that the half-brother of the Emir may have sent money to ISIS, including to the ISIS ""judge"" who ordered the murder of two American journalists. 
* Qatar is a country where homosexuality is illegal and subject to harsh penalties. 
* Qatar is not a democracy but an authoritarian regime where basic human rights are not upheld. 
* It has a bit of a Fyre-festival vibe. They don't have enough hotel rooms and the size of the country means that there will be fans everywhere, as opposed to being spread out as they would be in other countries. 
* Like all major events, there is always a risk of a terrorist attack. 
* It is also during Thanksgiving. Our match against England will be on Black Friday.

The Big 4 sports in America all have unbalanced schedules. It's not like the Premier League (or most other major soccer leagues) where every team plays every team the same amount of times. I assume you're using W-L record for ""best team"" but that's just not how those sports work. Playoffs make sense from a game perspective because teams can have lopsided strength of schedule, especially the NFL. Often a team will walk into the playoffs on a cupcake schedule and promptly get annihilated by a team with a worse record that had run into better teams in the regular season. That's what happened to the Cowboys last season, and the Cowboys in 2022. That's also why a decent amount of media, fans, etc. picked the Cowboys to lose.

Strength of schedule is not a thing in NASCAR because it's not a 1v1 sport. You're going against everybody every week for a whole season. There's no reason to have playoffs.

That's the whole reason why complaints and discussion about the format have not gone away in 20 years, and this specific format for 10 years, that Big 4 fans don't complain about. Ravens fans weren't telling people to throw out the format last year - they looked unbeatable, but they also never played a defense like the Chiefs, and that's what fan disappointment was concentrated on.

Meanwhile, in NASCAR, we see Larson, Byron, Hamlin, Reddick, etc. outperforming Logano most weeks. There's no comparison.",thejjjordan,,12,12,2024-10-21 16:02:12

lt0qn5y,t3_1g8ru5n,"The only way to include DNF's and not have it screw up the results is to sift out DNF's for a driver or team screwup vs. the 'I got collected in the big one' DNF's.  And obviously some of those instances are bound to be subjective instead of objective.

I've never thought that particular variable needed to be included when comparing driver performance.  Also, none of that base data is linked in your analysis either (but I take your word for it lol)",PantherChicken,,10,10,2024-10-21 15:37:56
lt0vxmr,t3_1g8ru5n,"I understand what you mean, but I find your methodology to be pretty useless in regards to comparing years and generations of cars. As you noted, your formula kind of gets trampled when you don't have the same drivers running up front every weekend, and with the unprecedented amount of parity so far this season, you could honestly spin this post as ""More parity in the cup series than ever!"" and make it a positive.

This is a cool way to compare drivers over the course of one season, but is a terrible way to make an assumption that Logano is worse than any other driver from any other season. For example, you don't note that by your data, Ryan Newman (ranked 10th) in 2014, MTJ (ranked 11th) in 2015, and Carl Edwards (ranked 10th) in 2016 are all as bad, if not worse, than Logano when compared to their competition.

It's also maybe not a great idea to include Round of 8 drivers in this methodology when comparing them to *just* Championship 4 drivers over the years. I would assume that Ryan Blaney, for example, probably clears other Round of 8 drivers from the past ten years such as 2022 Chase Briscoe, 2018 Aric Almirola, or even 2023 Chris Buescher after his run of great results.

Not to go full baseball but we need to consider adjusting for eras in regards to things like this. Gen 7 racing is way too different in performance level than at any point in the history of this sport.

lt1ximg,t3_1g8ru5n,"1 - As soon as the championship changed to ""win and you are in"" teams changed how they raced.  The reason NASCAR had to add in a bonus for winning the ""regular"" season was because otherwise there was no real advantage to winning after the first one.  MTJ proved this when he maximized stage wins over actual wins and built a huge lead in playoff points.....and won the championship.

2 - For the last few years there has been a consistent trend of Ford teams starting VERY slowly.  They put a ton of effort into Daytona and then basically suck for 8-12 weeks before winning in the second half of the year.  First for win for a Ford this year was race 13.  After that Ford won 7 of 13, 8 of 14 if you include the all star race.  Ford has won 3 of 7 playoff races with Chevy winning the others.  Toyota won 5 of the first 13 and 2 of the last 13 in the regular season.  Zero playoff wins.  Ford correctly deduced that winning in the playoffs had a higher payoff.  

3 - The comparison to stick and ball is inappropriate because in stick and ball a loss is forever.  In NASCAR only a win is forever.  College football is 12 games in the regular season.  If you go 0-11 in the first 11 games and then win the last one it doesnt matter one single bit, you are not getting into the playoffs.  Not so in NASCAR.  See Harrison Burton.  We can argue if that is right or wrong but it is the way the playoffs are structured right now.  Therefore, any metric using stick and ball statistics is useless.  You could win every one of the first 26 races and not even make it to the round of 12.  Look at Harvick in 2020 - clearly the dominate driver all year he missed the Championship 4 because of wrecking and finishing 16th and 17th in the last two races before the final.  Alternately, he missed the final because he finished second in the first race of the round of 4.  Who did he lose to?  Joey Logano.  Who won the Championship? Joey Logano.  If Harvick beats Joey in the first race, wrecking in the next two doesnt matter.  But just that ONE position was the difference between in and out.  Oh and it was the difference TWICE because Harvick missed the cut by...one point.  


Trying to jam the NASCAR championship system into stick and ball statistics is futile.

No other sport has a ""losing doesnt matter"" system

I‚Äôll start this by saying I think Reddick is the driver that most deserves the championship this year. Watched Larson wreck way too many times for it to be anyone else but Reddick. 

I‚Äôll bring up one point I haven‚Äôt seen mentioned yet, stage racing. I can‚Äôt back it up with numbers (don‚Äôt have quick access) but I imagine the only reason logano is still in is due to stage points accumulated throughout the season. *One could argue that Logano would have a higher average finish if he was not chasing stage points on mediocre days.* 

I despise stage racing and stage points. A car that runs 16th-20th all day can sacrifice their finishing position for points that *absolutely make a difference in the playoffs.* I would argue this format heavily favors the top 3 teams, as they are more likely to already be ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù to the playoffs and have the leeway to go for stage points. Compared to a team like front row where they need to try to position themselves for a win because the points won‚Äôt matter. 

I don‚Äôt know why mediocre cars have the chance to gain such a high amount of points through stage racing, it feels disingenuous to the sake of competition. Not really even trying to position yourselves to win the race, just be in x position 60% through the race.

Where are the metrics talking about crew chief ability? Pit call success rate? Pit crew average stop time? Pit crew error percentage?

I think a lot of us would prefer a system different than what we have. Hell I‚Äôd even settle for this system if they added a 3 race championship round, rather than one race. But they haven‚Äôt. So this post just comes off as childish and immature. ‚ÄúWhining‚Äù for lack of a better term. 

There‚Äôs plenty of seasons in the ‚Äúold era‚Äù where you could argue the best driver didn‚Äôt win the championship. 1996 comes to mind when Gordon got beat out by Labonte. Gordon won a ton of races but also DNF‚Äôd a lot in the races he didn‚Äôt win. Labonte scores more points. 

The point is, the system is the same for everyone. The drivers and teams all play by the same rules. 

Las Vegas, in my opinion, is THE perfect example of why this system IS so great. That was a team win. Joey Logano didn‚Äôt win that race. Paul Wolfe won that race. And that‚Äôs EXACTLY why you can never count out the 22 team. Joey is a great driver who just rises to the occasion. And Paul is a crew chief who does the same. The moment I heard that Joey was back in, I said he was making it to the Champ 4. They‚Äôre too good in these situations. And I knew they would win Vegas. I wasn‚Äôt surprised at all. That‚Äôs what they do. And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs great about this system. You come on when it counts and you get rewarded for it. All of the teams have the same ability to do it.

lt1uruk,t3_1g8ru5n,"This is a really great post, and thank you for putting so much time and effort into it. 

If you‚Äôre interested in refining the process to more accurately determine driver performance, I think you shouldn‚Äôt ignore driver rating. It‚Äôs true that finishing position is a big factor in driver rating, but it also accounts for average running position, passes, fast laps, etc. I think it‚Äôs a better descriptor of driver performance than results alone. 

DNF stats are really tough. A single season is just not that long (in terms of sample size), and DNFs are highly random. For example, how many races was Logano running well in and either didn‚Äôt finish or had a poor finish due to a random occurrence that had nothing to do with his own performance? I don‚Äôt know the answer outright, but that would be another way to refine driver performance stats. 

If you have a hypothetical driver who leads every lap and absolutely dominates the field but gets wrecked by lapped cars battling in the last quarter of the race and finishes 35th, that will greatly skew your measure of driver performance in a deceptive way. 

Another very important thing to consider is the weight used in calculating QBR. Blindly applying the same weights won‚Äôt necessarily give you usable data, because NASCAR is very different than NFL. 

For example, you‚Äôre using T10/starts with the same weights as completions/attempts, and points with yards. Do elite drivers have a T10:start rate that compares with elite QBs and completion:attempts? And a QB might throw for 300 yards. Rarely will they only throw for 50 yards. So yards and points are very much not interchangeable. To create a truly usable metric, you would need to establish weights that are NASCAR-specific, not NFL-specific. 

Anyway, really nice work, keep ‚Äòem coming!",2000onHardEight,,2,2,2024-10-21 19:04:10

I do however want to say that these ratings can sometimes not be truly representative of performance, because racing has such an element of chance in it that can make a driver‚Äôs results not nearly as good as their performance (For instance, Chase‚Äôs 2020 is highly underrated because he was incredibly unlucky for much of the year), and that‚Äôs why there is no such thing as a perfect championship system, because unless you have a ridiculously large sample size, there‚Äôs always going to be results that aren‚Äôt representative, even in a full-season system.¬†

Nevertheless, this system is a joke that doesn‚Äôt even begin to try to get the right result, making literally only one race matter. Imagine if David Starr doesn‚Äôt bring out that late caution in 2021. No offense to Truex, but that‚Äôs an outcome that would have put 1985, 1996, & 2003 to shame.

lt2lbjg,t3_1g8ru5n,Do they still divide the races into 3 sections that you can win (forget what they called them)? I would think that should be included,EverySingleMinute,,0,0,2024-10-21 21:16:46
lt2teqc,t3_1g8ru5n,"Respect the effort put into this. Given we have a playoff format, I don't think it's fair to say an underdog going in statically can't win or an underdog winning is bad for the sport. Other sports have upsets from low seeds in the playoffs and its usually well received.

My feelings are the drivers championship and owners championship should follow two different formats.

Drivers championship should be awarded to the driver with the most points at the end of the full season. Plain and simple. Winston Cup style if you want to think of it that way.

The playoffs should be marketed as just the Team championship (owners championship as we know it now). 16 best teams after 26 races, head-to-head for a 10-week playoff stretch. If you want to continue to give playoff bonus points during the season, I'm ok with some advantage to the top seeds.

If you want to go deeper, read on...

I have mixed feelings if win and your in should stay or go for qualification. I'm totally fine if a team wants to run multiple drivers in their car during the playoffs since it's a team championship. It's like an NFL team switching out the quarterback. Doesn't matter who the quarterback was as long as the team wins.

I think back to when Chase Elliott was injured. He didn't make the drivers playoffs but his team was in the owners championship. Seemed like TV ignored this fact. Probably cause they didn't want to confuse the casual fan with the two different concurrent playoff races. The interesting part is the owners championship is the one that pays out the big money but all we talk about is the drivers championship. The emphasis should be on where the money is.

I think this dual format also helps solve the waiver situation... Just get rid of it. Since the playoffs are based on team, it doesn't matter which driver is in the car and how many races they ran during the regular season. If a driver misses a race or more, all it does is decrease their full season championship odds. It still doesn't eliminate them though. Using Larson as the example, he missed a race and still has a great shot at the championship when the points are totaled over the full season. Which I'm fine with. If you run 35 of 36 races and still cover the field, you still deserve to be champion IMO.

Looking back, should Kyle have been drivers champion the year he missed substantial time due to a leg injury? IMO no. This format solves that. He could still come back and help the team win the team championship, but the drivers' championship would go to the driver with the most points at the end of the season. Which wouldn't have been him under this proposed format. I think that is fair.

I could do with or without the elimination every 3 races and limiting to a final 4 eligible for the championship. For simplicity, my vote would be do without elimination. Make it the most points after 10 races like the original Sprint Cup playoff format was. After a few races, a few teams will probably be mathematically eliminated and that's fine. They don't deserve to be in the conversation. A team with bad luck early could go on a streak to win the championship. Odds of 15 cars being mathematically out of contention before the final race due to the dominance of one team is probably pretty low. But if that were to happen, that team sounds more than deserving of the championship.

Depending on how the points play out, you could be able to market both the drivers and team championships in the final race if both are not mathematically clinched.

During the playoffs, because it is a team format, highlight the crews and their part in a championship run. It isn't just the driver that wins or loses a championship. The pressure is on the whole team for those 10 weeks. I like on some broadcasts they highlight the crew members of a given team. Always interesting to hear their backgrounds. I also like to see the performance compared with detailed analytics. Does the best team stay hot on pit road? Does an underdog team win the latest battle on pit road? Who has been the best all year (average) or best in the last few races to watch to remain hot? Who has been best on the given day?



Unrelated rants, I'm OK with no caution for the end of stages at any track if you still want to award performance at points during a race. I'm also for no overtime or restricting it to a single overtime attempt. I hate the long delays just to get the race concluded from multiple overtime attempts. If you didn't have overtime, rightfully as the best car at that point in the race, Austin Dillon wins under caution at Richmond and we don't have the controversy that played out. I'm pretty sure IndyCar is this way and I don't hear complaints. If there is a caution late in the race with enough time to restart and you basically have an aggressive restart at the end, that's fine, but let's no encourage it with the unlimited overtime restarts. I think it's also dumb when the unlimited overtime restarts go so long that cars start running out of fuel when no crew chief would realistically plan to run 30 laps beyond scheduled distance as a winning strategy.

TV will also finish within their window and not have to switch networks (unless there is a rain delay which can't be avoided). This leaves plenty of time for post-race analysis and driver interviews. Nice to hear the raw emotions after the race from many drivers. I hate to see the driver interview on the front stretch and TV signs off due to being over time. Might also consistently afford TV the time to go back to interviewing the driver once they get out of the car in victory lane with the team.",aj333888,,0,0,2024-10-21 22:01:29

Spain: I think, even more than Mapi Leon and Pa√±os, Spain will miss Patri Guijarro (an absolute brilliant top 3 CDM/CM) who is also protesting Vilda. She's the underrated Busquets-like cog in the Barca machine whose spatial awareness allows Bonmati and Putellas to shine.

Zambia: I'm very excited for Zambia. Something that often goes underrated in WoSo is that backlines are not particularly quick so someone with Banda's pace and intelligent runs will always get opportunities on goal. Think Zambia will just need to outscore their opposition and they can squeak through

jshddfo,t3_152t3a4,"Sweden is at an interesting point at the moment. While anything less than at least a quarter final would usually feel like a rather big fiasco, it feels a lot harder this time than usual to say where the team stands. Expectations do however feel unusually low ‚Äì lower perhaps than in a long time. 

Although we still have many players at the top international level, it is definitely a noticeably aging team. There is a growing feeling that Sweden has waited all too long with its generational shift, and manager Gerhardsson has come under more criticism than ever before for playing it too safe and electing his personal favourites of the old guard instead of giving new young players a chance. Not only the public and various experts, but also many of the players who were not elected, have been openly criticising the team selection this time around, and there definitely seems to the some frictions within the team ‚Äì sharply contrasting with the group harmony that is usually among Sweden‚Äôs strengths.  

The most evident example of not letting go of the old guard is the selection of Caroline Seger. The 38 year old has been injured for months and barely played for her team FC Roseng√•rd all season, and still got picked for the team, seemingly solely on old merits and her experienced leadership role in the team. The criticism of her selection over a younger talent has been massive, something that no doubt Seger herself has been feeling as well. 

While Sweden has got many important players in the big European leagues, the Swedish domestic league has been plummeting in relative quality. The league has been drained of star players compared to just a few years ago, with more and more players leaving to play in other leagues as soon as they get the chance. This drop in quality is especially worrying when it comes to developing new domestic talents, and risk harming the interest of supporters as well. There is also some worries about a lack of a good group dynamic within the national team now that the players are split up over many different leagues, compared to in the past when most played in the domestic league. The whole Swedish league is also in a bit of limbo and transition phase at the moment, as the old traditional women‚Äôs clubs are more and more having to make way to the newer women‚Äôs teams started by the more financially strong men‚Äôs club, who are taking over more and more of the upcoming talent. That transition, although seemingly inevitable, is however still far from completed as of now.      

Lastly, there has also been a general feeling that the team is perhaps focusing a bit too much on political statements rather than on football, which is again creating some friction. The team is also known for being generally very openly politically left-wing, while Sweden as a country has been moving more and more in a right-wing direction politically, especially under the current Swedish right-wing conservative government. So there might be some interesting dynamic there as well, if players feel like they can no longer fully represent Sweden as a country and what it stands for.    

Still however, with all of that said, Sweden has been very lucky with the draw, and comfortably advancing from this group should not be any trouble at all.",Malthesse,,5,5,2023-07-18 18:00:59

It is at least somewhat good to hear this from someone. It shows (at least for me) that there is some sort of comprehensive changes/reforms happening.


For example, Japan understands that its geography in case of an invasion is extremely difficult to defend, because an incursion would be from the sea, from west to east or vice versa, not from south to North. Being all in all 300km in width. So they have opted for small and ‚Äútoylike‚Äù military weapons, that are light enough to retreat, small enough to blend in mountains and hide, and can maneuver on old bridges/canyons/mountains‚Ä¶

I am an American who went to Paris 2024, and I had an incredible time. Every game I attended felt well organized. Crowd control in and out felt mostly well handled except for football. We stayed in a hotel a block away from the main Metro line for the venues so it was easy to get around. The frequency of trains departing after each game made it so we never felt crowd crushed.

Compared to my other trips to Paris, I was surprised how not crowded it was in the city. Sure, there were bottlenecks from Olympic traffic, but the usual city attractions like the Louvre felt empty. My understanding is a lot of locals skipped town and a lot of usual tourists also avoided coming to Paris due to the hiked up prices on hotel and travel.

I‚Äôm not going to pretend everything is hunky dory at the Olympics because I had a nice time. I know there a lot of problems that come with hosting the games, and I appreciated your insight as a local. I still left feeling very inspired by the comradely shared between nations and the collective spirit that you could really feel at each game. I am from Los Angeles, and I am hopeful my city will succeed at hosting in 2028. I am also prepared for all the drama that will come with it.

m77p5n3,t3_1i183zw,"In Poland there's been a handful of dramas at this year Olympics.

Paulina Paszek was very promising sprint canoeist, but in 2018 at 21 year old she suffered an injury and got written off. Soon after she left to work in Germany and was convinced there to return to sport. With the support she obtained she managed to overcome her injury and return to high performance in 2021, representing Germany since then. In Paris she won a bronze in K-2 500 m sprint and silver medal in K-4 500 m (canoe sprint of 2 and 4 women team). Polish team got fourth place in K-4 500 m and didn't qualify for finals of K-2 500 m.

There was also another drama in fencing. In dramatic finish with winning point in last 4 seconds (and subsequent vigorous celebration which went viral) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTlxVpUbHuo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTlxVpUbHuo) Polish women team won bronze medal in fencing (team √©p√©e). Afterwards in public interview they discussed nepotism and poor organization ot polish fencing association, which resulted in huge fallout in media.

Daria Pikulik won silver medal in omnium event (track cycling). Two days before, in an interview she complained about notorious polish cycling association (they are a drama on their own, or rather a trainwreck), a body (ir)responsible for her preparation. She said that cyclists did not receive any support and had to basically self-finance, that they got bicycles only 4 months before olympics and clothing the day before the event.

Overall, polish women won 8 medals (1 gold, 3 silver, 4 bronze), while men only 2 (1 silver, 1 bronze). This led to many snarky comments on supremacy of polish sportswomen over polish sportsmen.",megasepulator4096,,12,12,2025-01-15 03:11:39

- the metalworkers unions going on strike so they wouldn't have to cast the medals (apparently there's an IOC rule that the medals have to be made in the host country)
- the cement layers for the pools ""accidentally"" pouring them incorrectly, causing leaks

I was thrilled when they announced Herve Renard as the manager of Les Bleues. Even though he's been in charge for just a few months. A little bit disappointed that Amandine Henry got injured but I'm confident that he can bring the best out of the players. My only concern with France is that if the players are mentally well and ready for this tournament even after the issue with Corinne Diacre.

Dear reddit users, I implore you to please delete your entry.  Here is why: I noticed you have entered a comment in an attempt to win the reddit r/millionairmakers.  I decided to enter the draw this month in an attempt to instead skew the chances that I might be chosen because: ""Dear God please. I can't see that amazon comment for another redditor one more time""

With that plea, I wanted to skew the draw for  me but someone mentioned a power move and I realized the REAL power move would be in instead convince everyone to withdraw their comments so that only I could win.

I know that not everyone will delete their comments, but if even a few do, it may skew the odds in favor of me

So, I beg of you, please join my crusade and maybe, just maybe we'll all make reddit history!",peterson72,,1,1,2022-12-17 18:58:38

I'm holding the coin long term and love the tech behind it (speed is unparalleled), but the Foundation's treatment and current relay node situation doesn't inspire too much confidence. I think there are a lot of shillers in the comments who, while they love the chain, will defend it wholeheartedly. No, it has faults, it's important to point those out and work towards resolving them in order to grow Algorand and crypto as a whole.

Also, regarding the MyAlgo hack, this is unfortunate as hell but an important wake up call for investors: USE A COLD WALLET. If you can't sustain the $70 cost of a Ledger to secure your coins, you shouldn't invest. Nonetheless, it's sad to see. Not the fault of the Foundation (feels weird to say that), but it's important that we find the EXACT cause of the hack and how to prevent anything like it in the future, for the better of crypto.

Final note (not related to anything, just feel like pointing it out for any scared bagholders), it's concerning to see Foundation and Inc holding so many coins to begin with, but the upside to the coin dumping is this: More supply is being pushed out onto the market. The less there is to inflate, the more there is to acquire and the more that will eventually be lost, deflating the supply.",TechnoRanter,,61,61,2023-03-20 00:16:20

You posted numbers that showed Algo being sold by the foundation and being used to compensate board members. But if you add those numbers up it doesn't account for hardly any of that increased supply. I want to know what was the reason for rapid increase in supply? Was it just Algorand distributing the token? We're these grant payments? Something else?

All I learned from this post is Algo's token inflation was very high in 2021. You don't like the CEO of the Algorand foundation. You weren't a fan of the Foundation's marketing choices.

I will say though I do still believe in the tech and think algo will hold strong through all of this, I just really love the tech. I see many projects which honestly are amazing continuing to work and provide amazing products/services such as: Opulous, NFDomains, Tinyman DEX, Algofi, and games such as Algoseas and Fracctal Monsters. I will say I have definitely been diversifying a lot more in the recent months to other chains like SOL and ETH.

Let‚Äôs address the circulating supply. The fact this is still talked about is incredible. Yes it had a MASSIVE spike- due to pre laid out accelerated release schedules. OP literally mentions it has a max supply of 10b a few sentences later. MAX supply. Roughly 4.5x LESS than a coin like ADA for example. Inflation now does not matter- max supply and market cap do. 

It also blows my mind people can complain about the large supply Algorand Inc/Foundation had of Algos and then complain they are spending them in the same post. These are CONTRADICTORY statements. Do you want them to have a lot of Algos or do you want them to get rid of them? Please make up your mind. To be more decentralized it‚Äôs better they spend them all now so they trickle down to the market.

Lastly- all coins suffer in a bear, some more than others, let‚Äôs see where the indisputable high level tech lands Algorand (which is an EXTREMELY new chain) in the coming bullmarket. Bets are it‚Äôs staying a staple in the long term.",No_Cryptographer3388,,2,2,2023-03-20 00:21:04

One question I would have is how hard would it have been for BBC, ITV etc to present the games a studio back home, it would have been basically impossible to tell and sent a message they were covering it for the love of the sport and not to spend a couple weeks in a nice hotel.

j0unco3,t3_zpbecg,"The biggest problem in retrospect is that FIFA can get away with it because it's the World Cup. As bad as the circus was around this competition from the human rights abuses to taking part in the winter once it got going it was the World Cup. Saudi Arabia beat Argentina, the celebrations in Tokyo at 6am local time because they beat Germany, and Morocco fans taking over central London because of their extraordinary run to be the first African team to make it to the semis. That final. Messi. 

The World Cup is such a powerful cultural and sporting moment in the World that FIFA can abuse it and still survive. I am not sure how we break that pattern but I think pressure from Western nations and the threat of a breakaway as well as rooting out corruption in our own countries would help. 

The other thing is we need to be clear about what the problem is. I didn't like the winter World Cup and I didn't like the lack of alcohol but these should not be disqualifying criteria to host otherwise we do exclude a lot of the Arab world. We need to avoid those topics and focus on LGBT rights and migrant workers and pressure FIFA into making that disqualifying.

j0txuc3,t3_zpbecg,">So how should Labour and the left reflect on the World Cup?

Glad you represented these two things as seperate, as they are. For the record I'm the latter, not the former.

>Do we feel the approach to Qatar is justified? Does it make for a more progressive or regressive Qatar, UK and wider world?

Throwing money and attention towards a repressive regime is probably justified by the moral standards of our time. But frankly, you're throwing money at the people who used slave (or ""Kafala"") labour to make all this possible, whose country is horrendously repressive. Fans of football the world over made the elite of Qatar a bit richer. It's not justifiable to me.

>How should we tackle money from autocratic regimes flowing into our clubs with our top players, commentators and figures like David Beckham, Gary Neville, Gary Lineker and the England team participating & benefitting financially & socially from said regimes?

Fine the players and the club a meaningful amount? Maybe actually imprison those who take dirty money? Even just fucking dissolve the club? They're not historically important heritage sites or anything, they're just names, colours and a badge that can be remade.

>How should we tackle corruption in international sporting bodies like Fifa and their bidding processes?

Fines, refusals to host or attend their games.

>Should we stick to hosting international events in liberal democracies or should we move away from the Western centric venues to give the majority world a say?

It doesn't matter either way imo. We'll run into the hypocrisy and lack of justice present in either.

>Is it giving the majority world a seat at the table or do the elites fail to represent their people in any meaningful way?

Hosting football is not ""having a seat at the table"". What do you even mean by that?

But no, elites always fail to represent their people, at all. Let alone in a meaningful way. Also places like Qatar aren't representative of the world. Instead being an archaic throwback in a tiny corner of the world.

>How should Labour be consistent in its labour values and stick up for workers everywhere?

That's long since past lmao.

>How should we organise huge international events while being committed to carbon neutrality and lowering emissions?

Maybe we don't? Maybe we grow up as a species and stop seeing things like kicking a football around as worth the disgusting amount of energy and resources that go into them?

>What does the shift away from a Eurocentric world look like? Is Qatar a positive example of it?

I don't know, I'd argue it's merely shifting away from Eurocentrism to just being America-centric. But fuck no Qatar isn't a positive example - they used fucking slave labour to build sporting arenas so rich people could get richer.

>And how do you feel about this World Cup? Did you enjoy it overall or dislike it? Did you boycott it or watch it? How do you feel about the involvement of senior Labour Party figures in it? Should've England played at all in the Cup? Should they play in future cups if similar situations arise?

I think my opinion is fairly obvious by now. I don't hate football (as in playing the game) at all, but the large scale sport is beyond disgusting and Qatar is another step beyond that. I hate how Qatar just got away with it, because it's symbolic about the class conflict between workers and the rich throughout history; the rich got richer because of the work they forced out of the poor, some of whom died so those rich people could get richer.

j0tzjt5,t3_zpbecg,"For me personally, I haven't actually been watching the football all that much since losing my Dad back at the start of July. The motivation to do so has just disappeared since that event, it was a shared thing between me and him and we binded so much over a lot of things, mainly video games and football. We're both avid Liverpool supporters and watching the games have been really depressing for me lately, not bc of the team performance but because I felt guilty watching it without him, it just didn't feel right.

I was fortunate enough to travel to Liverpool last month for an Anfield experience day and was in complete awe as I walked around the stadium taking in all of the history of the club and what we achieved. It was the best day of my entire life and my dad would have been as giddy as a schoolboy. He would have talked the hind legs off a donkey telling me about everything we were seeing and honestly, it felt great that I had that moment.

With regards to the political furor over the Qatar World Cup, I don't feel its fair that we point the blame at people who are just doing their jobs in covering the tournament and equally it's not right that we deny these players particularly the younger lads like Jude Bellingham the opportunity it presents. 

It is the current landscape of the football industry at the moment whereby it is bloated on money from State backed teams like Manchester City, Newcastle and PSG. The industry is controlled by the money and avarice and I find that deplorable to an extent. It wasn't long ago that we were fantasising about the idea of ¬£100m pound players, and now it's been and gone with the likes of Darwin Nunez and Jack Grealish, and Kylian Mbappe costing clubs this outrageous amount of money, we have ayer contracts out of control. Some of these clubs are so bloated with money that  could by a couple of League 1 and 2 clubs and still have some change left in their coffers.

But again, this is the climate we find ourselves in. If the players and managers and clubs want the big money then they can't have any moral standing on these issues because the money is coming from the morally questionable countries in the first place.

I always find it laughable and interesting seeing politicians condemn the human rights abuses in countries like Qatar but when we tell them about how the UK supplies the Weapons to the Saudis that allow them to slaughter Yemen people, the very same politicians aren't so condemning of their own country. 

Almost as if they put their own pockets above the lives of other people.

The only match I watched of the tournament was the final, congratulations to Messi and Argentina. France surrendering like WW2. Messi is the One true goat, suck on that Ronaldo stans, he's officially better than him in every way. 

Now let's never speak of this tournament again and look ahead to the next World Cup, where is it by the way?

EA took the Asylum mutiny really hard. Even as her touring and releases kept bringing in [news fans ü¶†](https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbGh6NzNib3NieDZwNThiNWJrNWgyMnVlaGY5d211Y2xxeWhlczN5dCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/RkMuw6XZxPqNy/giphy.gif), she seemed to be getting, frankly, quite fed up with... the whole thing.

She had always been famously opinionated; a lot of early fans loved her for it. She was an outspoken vegan feminist in the Wild West days of the internet, which was kind of brave. In her public posts or on stage, she never sugar-coated her anger at injustice, oppression, and rude behavior. But starting around the 2011 tour, she really embraced the idea that if you can't punch a wall at a given moment, you can always take it out on Twitter.

We can imagine how it reached that point. She was touring the same album for the fourth time in five years. She was secretly struggling to play her trademark violin after a bad jaw surgery, and suffering through the pains of an insidious chronic illness. She had either dropped or been dropped by The End Records and was once again self-funded. By virtue of sheer statistics (and, maybe, possibly, by her encouraging a degree of engagement and loyalty that is doomed to devolve into either loathing or obsession...?), she was getting Single White Female'd by creepily enmeshed, trauma-dumping groupies at more and more shows.

And now these fucking (patronizing fucking) people, who dared call themselves ‚Äúfans‚Äù, were scrutinizing her every move and saying horrible things about her on the internet? Wouldn't you want to tell everyone, every last one of them, to eat dirt?

It's worth noting that EA's most infamous ‚ÄúTwitter Rants‚Äù, as they came to be known, were brought on by things that she had every right to complain about ‚Äì namely, people hounding her for free tickets online, and one fan physically threatening her and vandalizing her tour bus after being asked to wait for an autograph. (No, those two things are not exactly comparable, though EA wrote about them in very similar ways, because her rage only has the one setting.) But ask anyone who's ever had an angry, hyper-emotional mic-drop moment on the People's Internet: [it tends to make things dramatically worse üîç](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/jessi-slaughter-cyberbulling-controversy), even when history later acknowledges that [you sort of had a valid point there.](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/27/1010355669/chris-crocker-leave-britney-alone-video-creator-reflects-on-whats-changed)

>... To all those asking for free tix, free this, free that, kindly permit me inform you that the amount of $$$ I have lost on touring during the past five years is nothing short of astronomical, is far more than an upper class American‚Äôs yearly salary, and could in fact purchase a small city.

Come on, you can do it...

([Excerpts from select ‚ÄúTwitter Rants‚Äù üìù](https://web.archive.org/web/20170827155724/https://waywardvictorianconfessions.tumblr.com/twitterrants))

More and more EA devotees were reaching the [‚ÄúBitch Eating Crackers‚Äù point üîç](https://www.abbythompsontherapy.com/blog/2017/10/23/bitch-eating-crackers-syndrome) of their parasocial relationship. Disillusioned fans had come to see EA as a spiteful, self-absorbed, tyrannical diva, who always chose vitriolic tantrums over constructive dialogue ‚Äì and valued her ‚Äútrue Plague Rats‚Äù mostly within the confines of their function as her own personal army. The Twitter Rants solidified that perception.

Also, some of EA's fans were crushed by medical debt, or working three jobs while on food stamps, or living out of their car. Many people were; it hadn't been that long since the 2008 crash. These people were, of course, *thrilled* to read that they all ‚Äúmade more money‚Äù than EA.

In other words, I doubt these spectacular, heat-of-the-moment tirades achieved their ostensible goal, i.e. scolding shitty, inconsiderate ‚Äúfans‚Äù into not being shitty and inconsiderate. But they did bum everyone out, and made people kind of start... hating EA? Or, at the very least, stop pretending the Emperor wasn't naked.

...Is that sighing I'm hearing in the back?! I'm sorry, is my journalistic thoroughness offensive to you? Oh, you're ‚Äúsick of this Asylum nonsense‚Äù? You ‚Äújust want to know how it ends‚Äù and you ‚Äúhave other things to do with your life‚Äù? Well, if this write-up is too long-winded for you, I humbly suggest that you turn your attention and support towards redditors of a more placid, non-controversial, and less opinionated nature; there are more than enough of them out there, and I‚Äôm sure they all have HobbyDrama write-ups of their own. How fucking patronizing...

l3h76qh,t3_1cowh3n,"This really sounds like she speed-ran the early internet.  From creating a parasocial swamp before anyone knew about them, to demonstrating why a lot of subreddits ban the people they're supposedly about.


I do think she comes across as a doomed figure, although maybe not in the ""tragic Victorian"" way, because of this.  I have a friend who is very sensitive and emotionally open, in addition to having some mental health problems, and it makes life for her rather like running through a cornfield made of cheese graters.  Emily Autumn seems to have the same issues, only instead of turning inward she lashes out at the pain, yet can't stop running through the cheese graters. And, unsurprisingly, my friend is the one who sent me some of EA's tracks many years ago.

l3h20sm,t3_1cowh3n,"Oh, okay, I thought I wouldn‚Äôt know about any of this, but reading the name ‚ÄúFantineDormouse‚Äù took me right back there. 

What limited forum activity I did take part in was largely on (I think) a forum affiliated with BatteredRose - I dipped my toe into the main Asylum forums largely to lurk for recipes and scans of sheet music and other things like that. I found I wasn‚Äôt really emotionally connecting with the ideas of the Asylum that other muffins connected with, and I didn‚Äôt think the word replacer was cute. BatteredRose‚Äôs forums or forum affiliate weren‚Äôt much better but they were a little more free spirited, plus they had rarities you couldn‚Äôt find on the main site. That‚Äôs really all I have to say about what I remember - that and ‚Äúone of my friends saw the FD meltdown happen either in real time or in archived form after the fact and told me about it‚Äù. 

The thing that I find the most immediately compelling here is actually the whole debacle about multiple album editions. I‚Äôve been kind of casually joking on [one of my Tumblr blogs](https://half-moonshine-full-eclipse.tumblr.com/post/750038319839248384) about how I really actually do think that Taylor Swift has been copying EA for her latest album release and how this is the genuinely funniest outcome to the accusations of fakery that we could have never foreseen in 2011, but I also think it‚Äôs interesting that both Taylor and EA have come under fire from their more critical fans for selling multiple variants of the same album, making it hard to buy a physical release of all her music. That post on WVC from someone who ditched EA for TS seems even funnier now. 

The thing that makes me saddest is that the poisoned well of fan relations has made basically any nostalgia really fraught. People like me who never got ‚Äúburned‚Äù by her and who pulled away because we realized we were going a bit too far down the rabbit hole don‚Äôt really have places (besides this comments section) to talk. WVC is inhospitable if you‚Äôre not angry at her, in my opinion, and other places are basically dead. And she did this herself! If she‚Äôd just thought about taking fifteen minutes to calm down and gotten more comfortable with apologizing for going off half-cocked when she was triggered or in a bad state, that would have kept the fan community intact and would have helped her get better about not treating people she purports to love this way.

l3h0g4q,t3_1cowh3n,"EA lashing out at fans who dare to question her is like an extreme version of Space back in the 00s, when they released a track available for download on their website as part of the Music for Aliens series. (This was several years after Tin Planet and they were on the way out by then). One of the band members got angry at people - one of whom was me - who didn't like it, because by his logic, it was free and we should be grateful.


If you keep re-releasing an album with new added stuff on it, no shit the completists are going to get fed up. It's all very well saying 'nobody is making you buy it' but why keep re-releasing an album with a different tracklisting each time? Why not just wait for a bit and then re-release it with a whole load of new tracks? Because it feels like a rip-off.


This whole thing with EA and the Asylum sounds so one-sided. She wants it to be this fun little club but it's all on her terms and nobody is allowed to question her. You can't expect everything to be informal all the time and treat fans like your mates and then turn on them when they question you or disagree with you.

l3ikrbj,t3_1cowh3n,"Fascinating! I never heard of EA before this but I‚Äôve been excitedly checking for your updates because you‚Äôre so good.

A few other commenters have mentioned it but as an exhausted Taylor Swift fan, there‚Äôs definitely a lot of similarities between them - despite being on rather different scales of fame. The part about EA lumping in all criticism, valid or cruel, as the same kind of hate struck a Swiftie chord in particular. It‚Äôs become increasingly hard to criticise TS in fan spaces, and I think Taylor herself has endured so much misogyny throughout her career than she now views any criticism as people hating her because she‚Äôs a woman. Even if it‚Äôs coming from female fans who have supported her for years.

Apologies for the tangent! I simply have a lot of thoughts on TS and her relationship to fans/fame/etc that can‚Äôt be expressed because spaces tend to be either wholly negative or wholly positive towards her. Which again, seems to ring true of EA.

The amount of work you've clearly put into this is staggering, and using emojis to denote types of links is so incredibly helpful to the reader that I hope it becomes standard. Thank you for compiling this wild blast from the past!

Like a lot of folks here, I discovered EA when I was in my mid/late teens and Wasn't Doing Great, but I was never actually in the fandom - I just loved Enchant and Opheliac and sometimes lurked the forums. I saw a lot of the shit you've discussed go down but also missed a lot of details, and it's been so interesting filling in the gaps now that I'm in my 30s and Doing Pretty Okay, haha. 

After reading all this, I have a lot more sympathy for EA than I did in the past because it's obvious that she created her own monster but seemed to have no idea she was doing that. I think she truly loved/loves her fans (as much as you can love people you don't know) and wanted/wants closeness, but that same closeness seemed to make her think her fans were also her friends and would always have her back in every way. In actuality, a lot of us were just folks who enjoyed her music but didn't really care about her persona/the Asylum as an overarching concept. None of us actually knew her or had a way to care for her as a person independent of her content. This fandom is why I kind of roll my eyes when folks on celeb gossip sites scold each other for ~being parasocial~ when they speculate about celebs' relationships or whatever - y'all don't even *know* parasocial!

I don't listen to EA often anymore - I hopped off when FLAG came out because I really didn't like it - but I bumped Opheliac in the gym yesterday in this post's honor and it did get me amped, haha. It's kinda sad thinking about the fanbase/relative success EA could have had if she could've stepped back from the Asylum concept a little, gotten out of her own way, and just released a solid follow-up to that album.

Even as a fan I somehow just can't see this JDG team working.

I really don't believe in Xun regardless of his worlds ""glow-up"" (which mostly involved spamming Skarner) and as much as I love Missing he had a truly atrocious 2024. Peyz still has to prove himself out of the Chovy system, and Ale while he obviously has the talent has the tendency to completely shut his brain off at times and throw crucial moments. 

I don't even want to get started on Scout who this subreddit somehow thinks had a good 2024 despite him having approximately 3 good weeks out of 52. I'd love to see all 5 players on this team suddenly play to peak form, but I can't see it happening.

Also pleased to see where LNG is ranked, I have some doubts on Photic but Zika/haichao are straight up some of the best ""new-gen"" sololaners of the current LPL, and Zhuo honestly had a pretty solid year.

based on individual skill and recent results, this roster is easily top 3.

Biggest question mark is actually IG . if this was 2020 -21 i would have no doubt.. but we didnt see the shy or jeije performing at the highest level in over a year .
i don't doubt rookie and meiko tho .if meta stays  to play around botlane + jngl , then ig have rly god chance to be top4 team.

funny,this is first time ever that rookie has world class support .

i think support and jungle are most important roles in the game , especially at high level.

however if meta somehow becomes top lane oriented with skill matchups, im scared that the shy can't match best top laners in the world 


 important thing to mention, game will change a lot next year..

i think its so hard to predict who will benefit from it and get good read on meta.

m2pkr5t,t3_1hh8pwi,"Disagree with a lot of points on the JDG lineup but I can see where you are coming from. My top 4 is BLG, JDG, iG and TES. Feel like Xun is actually a really good jungler who can inject early activity into a team with historically more passive players such as Peyz and side laning Scout. I also think Scout didn‚Äôt look great on LNG last year due to the JG/supp around him not making his life that easy compared to the likes of other duos around the world. Being a super strong side laner still requires attention to set up vision and strong points to allow you to farm and his late game carry ability along side Peyz make me confident in the team. MISSING had a mid to bad 2024 but I think it was more of an anomaly, and I think the structure that Xun and Missing can set up early for ganks and late for side lane farming will enable scout and Peyz a lot. Ale is the one person I‚Äôm worried about because I think he‚Äôs mainly a noob stomper.

I'm still undecided on JDG because I could easily see them mental booming because of that clown Cvmax but I could also see them ramping up in summer when they have more synergy, and Ale is historically a monster in playoffs. I see your point about mid/jg synergy but I also love pairing cleanup adc's with aggressive top laners and that's what JDG did here. I saw someone saying Peyz is a resource-heavy but I totally disagree, Chovy was a resource hog on GENG and Peyz consistently ranks low in gold/cs share stats  compared to other top adc's. I like pairing up Peyz with guys like Ale and Xun who are willing to be aggressive in teamfights and sacrifice themselves to give their adc space to output dmg. 

Tbh the team you underrated the most was NIP, I would be shocked if they finish bottom 3 with that roster. It would give me lots of ammo as a Rookie stan though so I wouldn't complain.",drakkarrr,,3,3,2024-12-18 21:02:00

I absolutely understand that the Bills should be the favorite in the AFC and could be devastating come playoff time.  Von Miller is a huge add.

But they lost a great CB in White for the first half of the season, their #2 CB Levi Wallace left in free agency.  Of their top 4 CBs on their opening day 2 have never played a game, one has only started 8 games over 2 seasons, and their best guy is Taron Johnson who is a fine corner but not in any way elite.

And while Von Miller is excellent, their top 2 pressures guys Addison and Hughes are no longer on the team.  Von is going to have to make the other players better.

When their talented rookie CBs get some experience and Tredavious White comes back they will be a nightmare.   If this is 'who do you think will win the Super Bowl' they have as good a case as any to be sure, and #1 is quite reasonable.

jmqx2k0,t3_13ynmfe,"There‚Äôs a conflation between the actions of a tiny, tiny minority, and the collective browbeating of the vast majority that has nothing to do with it. There are about 1m registered hockey players in North America, plus family members, staff, let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre talking about a pool of around 5m active participants and then about 15% of the population that are ‚Äúavid fans‚Äù in the US, let‚Äôs say around 30 million. 

1% of that population is 50,000 participants and 300,000 fans. The cited incidents involve far, far fewer than those numbers. 

So if you accept the premise that the number of people who are ‚Äúnon-inclusive‚Äù or actively bad actors in some way is far, far less than 1% of the total fanbase/industry, what is the point or desired objective of the campaigns against ‚Äúhate‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-inclusion‚Äù? If the goal is to reduce ‚Äúbad incidents‚Äù to zero, that is practically impossible. What is ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù? What is the strategy?

This is what I think people push back on - being smeared with a broad brush that should be a laser point instead. A permanent campaign with no real tangible goals. A massive guilt trip for the 99% of people that have nothing to do with any ‚Äúbad‚Äù things.

I don‚Äôt think most people that are on this have bad intentions, I think the message and the campaigns are just Ill thought out, purposeless and have next to zero effect on the actual people acting badly.",,,2,2,2023-06-03 14:52:51

I am from Ontario and have had the privilege of playing hockey in my youth and as an adult and I have play some very good leagues that are inclusive and supportive of all peolel looking to play. But i can tell you that higher level hockey is more about how much money you can pump into it and who you know than about your skill.  People will spend 10k or more a year to get their kid on the triple A team or whatever.  Yes there are stories of rags to riches and guys overcoming shifty childhood to play in the nhl.  But mostly it is a rich white boy sport, at least in ontario.  And I really don't think you will ever overcome the other issues of discrimination, racism and toxic hockey culture (hockey more important than you family or school) if it remains a sport for which the higher levels are only attainable if you have money.

I was never allowed to lace up as a kid because of a fictional ""heart condition"" my mother made up when it was clear that I wasn't welcome in locker rooms. Not at school and certainly not at an ice rink. I could run cross country, when I was in high school I played water polo and swam, but for some reason this ""heart condition"" meant no hockey or football. When I swapped doctors as an adult, an echocardiogram was done, no heart condition was found. A few light bulbs went off in my head and a lot of sadness about my childhood was felt. 

You couldn't even be in house league in rural Canada in the 90s and maybe be a bit different without being at risk. Your own parents didn't think you would be safe, and would rather lie to you than tell you the truth.

This right here is \*precisely\* why I am against such things. It always comes with the conditional and that inherently contradicts ""hockey is for everyone"", which is frankly just a marketing strategy. The NHL knows their audience and player base is going to be 90ish% heterosexual white men, from NA or Europe; as a result, they have tried to grow the game with minority communities, which has so far, failed rather spectacularly (MLS has spent the last 15 years overtaking hockey in the ""big 4"" leagues in the USA). The strive for diversity=the strive for more people to give them money, simple as. I get the argument that the whole point of the campaign is to market hockey in markets it is not traditional in, but at that point, it very much seems to be a case of alienating or angering a lot of their normal fanbase to attempt to introduce a new one. The only move to be more inclusive that I see working is the Yotes/Roadrunners Native elements in aesthetic, or the Mexican cultural quirks that occur at games (such as corridos being played during pauses in play), and we might not even be here the year after next.   


People need to stop assuming that not wanting ""Pride Month"" rainbows all over everything for 30 days doesn't make them a homophobe or a bigot. People do not have to endorse or celebrate your lifestyle, and not doing so doesn't make them bad people. And frankly, my personal take, is that a lot of this seems like a form of social conquest. Both in hockey and otherwise, there is an undercurrent of replacing the old ""racist homophobic"" order, which I would argue doesn't exist, with a new one that just so happens to align perfectly with social liberalism, which reminder, \~50%+ of the country doesn't jive with. Which again, if you dislike that, ok, you do you, but people shouldn't be forced to tolerate something; it is no longer tolerance at that point, it is mandated.

kag0pia,t3_181k12p,"Thank you so much for this!! 

I personally did not know about Lily/Taylor until very recently on this sub! I think it makes a lot of sense. 

All of Taylor's albums have a mix of love and heartbreak songs. So I feel like there are always multiple muses featured on an album. The current one/new one and an ex. Or multiple exes. Which is why it never fully made sense to me that all of rep and all of lover were about karlie. I think the new long songs on 1989 are karlie and the exs are Diana. So on rep and lover the exs being about Karlie and new love being about Lily would make a lot of sense! 

Also I've said this before, I think sometimes Taylor may start with a specific muse in mind but it can become more broad and even reflect on patterns in her love life. Especially if it is about secret wlw relationships. 

Like I personally think Getaway Car is about Karlie and it makes even MORE sense if she left Karlie for Lily, another model who ran in the same circles. 

My theory about Karlie and Taylor is that Taylor was the other woman. Some have speculated Karlie and Josh are in an open relationship. I definitely prefer that theory. It's nicer to think about! But I feel like Taylor's lyrics say something else.

""The ties were black, the lies were white""

""But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story, and now we're both sorry""

""We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side, to the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in (oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar""

I could see Karlie telling Taylor she was going to marry Josh but it didn't have to change anything between them. And Taylor chosing to leave instead of staying in that situation. Also, illicit affairs I think is about her and Karlie and having an affair. 

I also think this is the deep betrayal she references DBATC:

""Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper thin plans""

Maybe she had plans to leave him but ultimately didn't. It makes more sense that this song about an ex is paired with Paper Rings about the current love, Lily. What a beautiful connection, one paper to hurt you and one paper to commit to you. I always thought these songs were connected. Paper cut vs paper ring. Also paper rings references past loves:

""Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall,""

Your analysis of champagne problems is very interesting!! I always thought it was about Karlie because of this line especially:

""How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again""

And that word being ""squad"" since they got destroyed in the media for it. Although, it could be interesting if this song was about both, in a way:

""One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready, so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you""

A lot of people interpret ""one for the money, two for the show"" as Karlie's 2 weddings. But maybe, it's about Taylor. ""One for the money"" could refer to her losing the love of her life (or who she thought was at that time) to money. The kushners. Two, the second love of her life (who she thought was at that time) Lily, because Taylor wasn't ready to come out. She's still putting on a show.

Anyway, really great analysis!! I'm really excited to relisten to these albums with this info and see what I notice ‚ù§Ô∏è",piercecharlie,,47,47,2023-11-23 14:59:07

I‚Äôd also like to ask some of the people who are smarter than me to look over the Daily Mail articles about Lily. They‚Äôre known for posting absolute non-stories (like look at this woman wearing clothes!) when they want to subtly hint at something they aren‚Äôt allowed to print. They will then drop very subtle clues into the articles as to what they want to actually say.

You done good, kid. My Tily heart runneth over!! What a wonderful, well thought out, beautifully written post! I love your writing, and you can see all the care and hard work you put into this! As a frustrated Tily truther in this sub (I know you know what I‚Äôm talking about w/the m\*ds and the coverups üòÇ), I‚Äôm delighted to see so many new Tily believers because of your post, great job!! I especially loved your format, the ease of following and all the new evidence you gifted us with! But the cherry on top was not even including the ring because that is the only thing the nay sayers use to refute Tily and it‚Äôs the worst argument in the Gaylor fandom. There is so much other evidence not counting the ring, loved that mic drop.

Like you, I feel like Lily deserves so much more love from the fandom, esp considering she was the best partner to Taylor and seems to have been the only supportive and healthy relationship she has had. Lily deserves credit and respect for that! She supported Taylor in her darkest time, and seems to have helped her heal and grow immensely during their time together. Lily was her longest ‚ÄúLover‚Äù, and she has always been the most interesting muse to me. I look forward to more of your posts! xo",villanellaella,,23,23,2023-12-01 00:30:08

kbih14i,t3_181k12p,"this is incredible! a breathtaking amount of work. it's so wild to imagine, if it really was lily from 2016- 2019, what it's been like for taylor to see kaylors (and eventually karlie herself lol) latch onto all of these references.

i'll admit that one of the things i find suuuuper fulfilling about taylor's songwriting is her incredible ability to use imagery across several different songs/albums, and create callbacks. it's kinda weird to rewrite so many of my mental narratives to be about someone else!

but also honestly while i'm sure karlie and lily are different people in terms of personality (and indeed if we want to think about an ""angel boyfriend"" i actually think joe and lily are publicly withdrawn and british in almost exactly the same way lol), it's also true that on paper they are similar in many ways. i can still barely tell lily and martha hunt apart so it makes sense to me why imagery that could be linked to karlie could honestly work for any blonde model with light eyes.

it's definitely interesting to think about kaylor breaking up in 2016... when karlie would have been 23 still (for the first half of the year) and also putting her at \~2 years before her wedding, so right on time to start the conversion process. it's kind of wild to imagine taylor writing multiple incredibly tragic songs about karlie still in 2020, but i have also long-imagined that many of the everlore songs already existed in one form or another and were being saved for the right project.

i know the public likes to have this narrative that taylor is so confessional that she can perform these incredibly emotional songs as soon as they come into existence. but it makes a lot of sense to me that she would hold onto them for a while before sharing them (and that part of her heart) with the world.

Is Taylor telling us if she were a man she'd just want to do business deals on a yacht with beautiful models or if she were a man just date a bunch of beautiful models? lol 

It also kind of sparks my intrigue in some theories that Taylor is writing lyrics in a way that causes fans to search certain terms and that's what shows up the most instead of what was originally posted (such as Slut! being a campaign to push down all of the old slut-shaming articles of 1989). When you search Leo in St. Tropez, you also get photos of Taylor with models like the squad and screencaps from The Man music video.

m02c4hk,t3_1h4ykal,"I'm glad the media are beginning to talk about this.

My club has had the vast majority of our league games cancelled this season due to the oppo being unable to field a team. We are a social club that only tends to to play other social clubs or other clubs' 2nd/3rds teams. 

It seems even big clubs round us that boast of having ""5 senior men's teams"" actually struggle to scrape a 2s together these days.

These cancelled fixtures have led to our club now struggling to fulfil fixtures - it is hard to justify booking every Saturday afternoon out if games keep getting cancelled.

Personally, I think we're seeing a number of factors that have impacted the men's game that were not really mentioned in the article:

- More people having to work weekends to make ends meet / pick up side hustles

- The COVID pandemic saw swathes of players in their 20s and 30s retire early. They couldn't get over the mental hurdle to go back into full contact rugby after 2 years without it 

- The work from home/hybrid work culture makes other forms of exercise more easy and convenient for working-aged people. Organised sports don't have that luxury. I have former teammates who got really into fitness during COVID and don't play anymore as they don't want to be injured and miss the gym / the 10k they're signed up for, etc.

- Young people are putting less emphasis on drinking as a form of socialising- this is part of rugby culture that can be stuck in the past at some clubs. 

- Fathers taking more responsibility with raising their kids - means a lot of young men are not willing to be gone all of Saturday for 8 months of the year to play a sport.


It is fair to say that some of these factors like WFH culture, less drinking, and more engaged dads are better for society, but with the other impacts from covid and the cost of living crisis it spells a bad time for rugby.",NewCrashingRobot,,56,56,2024-12-02 17:32:35

m024b81,t3_1h4ykal,"Putting a competitive team out every weekend has always been a problem, long before we played in leagues.  The challenge is keeping your good players who  are going to be poached by the bigger clubs, encouraging your mediocre players so they don't give up and go play soccer, accepting that people want to do things like go skiing, get married and take care of family. 

Trouble is that getting them to train 2x a week and play on Saturday becomes a major commitment for armatures who are doing this for fun.  When I started we had a couple of cup competitions and a couple of local derby games that you could not loose, the rest of the season was mix and match.  Now with the league every weekend matters.",Bloke101,,42,42,2024-12-02 16:51:29
m02dvdj,t3_1h4ykal,"I think the nature of rugby makes a downward spiral for low-turnout clubs hard to avoid.

m03x4vy,t3_1h4ykal,"When I was at Uni, captain the Medical School team for two years circa 2017-2019. Most players 18-25, the very ages the RFU are trying to reach. 

Joined us up for the local leagues, started going to all the County Rugby committee meetings, got us involved in the community. 

For those two years, took the club from 20 members to 90, three regular teams and a women‚Äôs section. The most success we‚Äôve ever had and last season (2023-2024) was the best season in our history. 

However - the RFU leagues were a disaster. No way to be flexible - playing midweek or Sunday was a no. Saturday morning or evening? Nope. Rearranging fixtures that fell out of term time? Nope. Ended up with being kicked out of the league due to not fulfilling fixtures - way to keep the 18-25 year olds! 

Our Uni hated us because they thought we were destroying the traditional university clubs, so we had no access to facilities and when we did had to pay full, non uni prices. No help from the RFU there at all. 

Finally we had an annual grant from the RFU of about ¬£1000 which would basically help us cover pitch costs. That‚Äôs now gone, as well as the rugby development officers. 

Fortunately managed to secure some long term funding and now we play Medical School cup and invitational fixtures. 

The game isn‚Äôt dead because people don‚Äôt necessarily want to play, especially at uni. It‚Äôs dying because at every single level we had some bureaucracy or idiocy that prevented us from playing. There‚Äôs no flexibility from the ‚ÄòOld Guard‚Äô who still run the county systems, university‚Äôs who hate change and the RFU who have pulled all funding. 

I went on to play for a decent local team after I left uni, but then Covid happened and my job as a Doctor meant I didn‚Äôt have the flexibility to play Saturdays or regularly train, so what‚Äôs the point in playing? Especially when we only tend to be in the same place for a year or two at a time.",SundanceKidTwo,,17,17,2024-12-02 22:31:07
m0240so,t3_1h4ykal,"Another point which isn't mentioned is that with less teams, the leagues are shuffled and restructured, resulting in further away games. What once would've been a league where every team was within an hour's journey, will become two, if not three.

I've noticed quite a few teams who put out very different sides playing home/away, I'd imagine it's a combination of time and money which not everyone is willing to give up to play the sport.

Hopefully the entering of 2nd and 3rd XVs in the league structure will help resolve this, but if this is not managed correctly, you'll have small teams which will have to travel a four hour round trip to a powerhouse team who'll be putting 50+ points on them.

m02iian,t3_1h4ykal,"We've had a slow crumble since covid that's really spiralled in the last year and a half.

We're noticably older as a club, feel there's a missing generation of 22-26 year olds. As a club we've always been a bit crap at keeping our juniors, they bugger off to uni. But we used to be good at recruiting students that come to our area, and getting them for a few years, and keeping those that stuck around for work after, which we've not been as good at the last couple of years.

But you can clearly see we're not alone, unfortunately loads of clubs I've played against have either lost teams, dropped from the rfu into the merit leagues or in a couple of cases folded.


All of the things mentioned have effected us, but I'm not sure there are any simple solutions. As others have mentioned all other traditional English sports are having the same issues - I've spoken to people from football cricket and rugby league clubs, and would be very surprised if hockey is an outlier.

m046fdj,t3_1h4ykal,"I used to captain a 4th team for a club in Surrey rugby. I occasionally turn out for a game despite retiring as the team is often struggling for numbers.

Memberships are pretty expensive - ¬£35 or so on top of the gym membership

The standard you see generally is so decent now (and so many people now have more knowledge of S&C) that it‚Äôs really easy to get run over if your tackle technique is out. I can imagine really hard to get back into the game after a long time out
 
Also, for the love of god why are league games scheduled on international weekends. It‚Äôs so frustrating scrabbling for players when in all honesty you‚Äôd prefer to watch two 6n games in the clubhouse‚Ä¶ the season ends in March/ April generally, a lot of people would like a couple more games in the nice weather!

But really playing rugby every Saturday isn‚Äôt really compatible with a lot of modern life.

And hearing that guys wouldn't play the game if they didn't get their 50 pounds for a game.  

Which is not amateur rugby in any sense.  Amateurs pay the club! 

One of the reasons the game didn't really grow here was the lack of investment in youth rugby until the late 1990s, adults played but kids didn't because most people played in college or got recruited in bars. 

Keep investing in juniors, the more juniors that play, the more that may continue playing as adults.

Why Wakefield as a club disappeared shows that the club was organized horrifically, an amateur non-profit with its own foundation should have been spun off at the start of professionalism, or professional squad spun off from the club when they went professional.  Sad that the board of club men didn't have foresight.

In basketball, the London Lions had to pull out of European competitions due to financial struggles. Over on the rugby league sub, there‚Äôs constant news about teams in financial trouble. Cycling is seeing pro conti teams shutting down, and in motorsport, rallying is struggling, with events being canceled because there aren‚Äôt enough marshals. I don‚Äôt know much about cricket, but it seems like no one cares about the county championship anymore.

Outside of football, almost every sport seems to be financially sinking with football only staying afloat because so many teams have sugar daddies willing to foot the bills.",oalfonso,,7,7,2024-12-02 17:48:12
m025276,t3_1h4ykal,"Rugby doesn‚Äôt help itself with being an overly complicated sport to get to grips with. The club I play for has seen a handful of new recruits with little knowledge of the game and it‚Äôs clear that a few are struggling with the learning curve. We wouldn‚Äôt have a team without them, but they‚Äôre having to learn the hard way often during a game.

I also find that returning to play after over 10 years out, that the physicality and fitness demands are a lot greater even in the pub leagues. This one could be in my head, but it definitely took a while for me to get my confidence back up and feel like I was able to make some sort of impact on the park.

We‚Äôve just played our first game in 2 months due to teams unable to field players or weather issues. This proves incredibly difficult to keep guys coming to training and being up for a game whenever the stars align. 

The point about WhatsApp is interesting. I often think about how difficult my old club captain had it when he was firing text messages to anyone in town that had played in the last 20 years to try and get a team together.

Lot of schools dont have teams, play combined or have a fraction of what it once was.
