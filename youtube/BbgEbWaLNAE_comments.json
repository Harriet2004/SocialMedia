In the actual sheet music the first part, which is what he mostly played, is quite simple so if you just play that its true you cant really  call it advanced, but the much more advanced part comes in after what he played, but he never actually played it. and to make what he played \"advanced\" he just added in a few more notes of the chords in-between what was already there, and through in a few more octaves and scales. Not to mention he took away all the emotion and depth the original piece has just to make it look more impressive",

They're nothing short of breathtaking and you turned an already incredible soundtrack into something so much more!
